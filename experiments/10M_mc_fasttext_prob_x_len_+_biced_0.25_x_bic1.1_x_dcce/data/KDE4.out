&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; consistent ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions .... opening the Kar@@ tei@@ card tools and select the modules there . &quot;
this is a list of default modules made of a package ; add @-@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base base ; it contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for cras@@ hing , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module Pres@@ filter ( also called Ord@@ ner@@ filter ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filters . with the module you can &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s updated working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M design view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the displayed website . as pre @-@ setting the display starts with the root notes of the document , sample : art element , all other knot@@ s are sub @-@ elements of this litter . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ - and text views so that you can view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; it is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface area is proportional to its size . the size must possess that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder is defined by the size of the file as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then can be detected , even if they are far down in the folder @-@ hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command @-@ command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the tre@@ ach representation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . easier navigation systems own the right corner of sensible color and let@@ tering settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched via color mode , can either be a depth for the easy detection of the sc@@ rap or image of another file like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be displayed with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify , if enough space to display is present or whether the surface area of sub@@ ordinate rights is to be used ( whereby the surface area of sub@@ ordinate rights occur ) . moreover , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for tre@@ ach algorithms for tre@@ adm@@ aps , this goal is not always observed that the surface area is proportional to the size of the entry . it will be drawn to the prescri@@ ptions of entries , and these frames need space , which then the sub@@ ordinate entries is no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle square is square . &quot;
&quot; like distribution of the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation remains to be retained . here , it is to be set up to the implementation . here , it is to be given for the cap@@ turing and avoiding of space losses by setting up the areas that are the square . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second . &quot;
&quot; you can view the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry in area . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , was designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module image gallery will be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

a simple to use camera cameras will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly . of course every medium and any card reading which is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; publication ; working together .
&quot; &amp; publication came ; contains a quick image processing with basic processing tools . you can use it to consider your photos , comment , to evaluate and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plugins ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; publication came ; easy to use , it provides pl@@ ast@@ ering professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color room and all available modules support the raw conver@@ tion by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC @-@ dy@@ e . &quot;
&quot; improved database with significantly more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens to be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; publication ; an open source project . that means , it is based on the support of the end user , so you should report problems and improvement options . &quot;
&quot; when you arrive at the program , your web browser will be able to make problems or requests as easy as possible . if you are using these links , your web browser opens a page on error system . all required information is already registered . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer came to each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; publication ; and hopefully soon we would answer questions of other users ; however , in this mailing list , you should therefore be mighty . &quot;
&quot; you can also visit the publication ; homepage visit , to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; publication . &quot;
&quot; the best start to get involved , is part of the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to the sign in the developer @-@ mailing list of &amp; publication came ; &quot;
&quot; if you &amp; publication came ; for the first time you want to store your images and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folder . you can simply enter the name or click the folder symbol , to select a folder . &quot;
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folder .
later you can add as many folders as you want to add . &amp; publication came ; will be used in addition as Al@@ ben@@ library . settings
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures , as the base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came , thir@@ sty the libr@@ arian path throughout its depth . you can shut no sub@@ folder , unless it came in hidden folder . this allows you to get refres@@ hed &amp; publication ; do you get a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will take no photos than symbols . you can change it by using any photo from the album and this is used as an album symbol . for more details , see the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and my key@@ hole , to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; rout@@ ing support : if you want to use the raw mode of your camera , you may get involved . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported rough cameras in the Help menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
a simple to use camera cameras will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly . of course every medium and any card reading which is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; publication ; working together .
&quot; modern digital cameras are registered with the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera can also be implemented as a USB @-@ mass storage device . the connection can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) , and its derivatives . older cameras can also be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) . &quot;
&quot; the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is used for digital camera cameras , which has continuously supported increasing number of digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supporting the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to calcul@@ ators and other peripher@@ als , without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general large files are outdated and transfer the pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of the supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ on photo@@ 2 needs to be read with li@@ bex@@ if support has been used to read the thumb@@ nails of publication . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support may not be left or the production might be very slow .
&quot; one of the most beautiful things to be seen , is how easy to extend its functionality by modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugins Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; publication ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate pictures in almost any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; publication came ; by writing a small module to complement a function than the changes in &amp; publication came ; even perform . &quot;
to simplify the window you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
&quot; this can be drawn up and put by pictures everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , across the horizontal separ@@ ating line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not available in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to wi@@ pe it out : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filters is used only for the fields , which will be displayed in the symbols view . thus , the filtering on the file name will be displayed only when this in the symbol is displayed . what fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog of the al@@ ben@@ settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ quot ; presents a organized view of your phot@@ al@@ ben . these albums are saved according to the folders , where they have been created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ ding properties or after the date , where the album was created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also select a screen photo directly to an album . select the album impor@@ ter Screen photo . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move the picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album . then you can select the picture by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them onto the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to provide you with information about this collection . to access the album features , you need to click on the album with the right mouse button and select the album menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ any collections : are a method to highlight your albums by selecting from your photos by collection , so you can select or delete from your photos by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : will be used if you sort your albums after date with view albums by date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , new : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . in addition , the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information will be charged . if this fails , instead , the date of the last change of each file in this folder will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you first got an album in &amp; Continu@@ e ; this will help you remember the first picture in the album as a symbol of the &quot; &quot; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ eration show . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; an album can always be included in a collection , and the collections cannot be scr@@ apped . &quot;
&quot; the entry was added ; supports the input of key@@ note for individual photos in the main window . album collections have another effect . for the collection , all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this thumb@@ nails with the two sto@@ ves in tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time , you &apos;ll just wait to wait while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid , in which you can create again in the menu ex@@ tras All pres@@ cient images . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the preview . what information this is , you can change about settings ; set up . select here the albums page and adjust the area of thumb@@ nails to your wishes . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails have the opportunity to rest . if you want to rest for a moment about a picture . the help shows the most important features , including all tags of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
photos are all to organize your photos . the pictures and tags allow you to organize your photos as it fits . you can reach all the functions that come with &amp; publication ; you can choose all the functions that come with &amp; publication ; you can choose between the viewing of the images ; a car@@ et@@ au or the processing of images .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by clicking on either F@@ 4 image ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... selecting . picture editing you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the picture editing you can view your photos and change them .

&quot; you should be aware that it may come after processing through other imaging programs to problems with the met@@ adata data . therefore , some programs store this data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way is available , poses two choices for the rotation . the easiest way to click the preview and select a rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you came out a photo of &amp; publication ; delete , it is moved to the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 picture del@@ eting or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to really Dele@@ te , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ is@@ quot ; organized your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; publication came ; used for this either the EX@@ IF @-@ date or , if this is not available , the date of the final modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image review . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ um@@ san@@ ction , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
photos with key@@ note provides a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and catalog your photos . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again .
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this key@@ word is displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords , so you can also organize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling ; together , so you can find the tags you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and wei@@ rd word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . in addition , the tags will be imported in other programs . in addition , the tags will be imported during the loss of the database as soon as &amp; publication ; the pictures notice . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button , and then select new key@@ word . if you add a new key@@ word after you click on an existing one , this is how you get there . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the keywords using the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ note by moving it to the desired position in the tree and then throw there . then a menu that gives you the opportunity to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be one time in the tree .
&quot; you can modify the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button , and select the key@@ word menu . you can change the name of the sampling and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; publication ; s functionality with key@@ word can first happen : once you have chosen the photos with a key@@ word , you can first click on the appropriate word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; pull and click there . alternatively , you can also select it with the right mouse button , and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords , one for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have added a photo with key@@ note , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a key@@ word by right clicking the menu menu of the photos and select from the tags menu removal . the menu shows you only the tags you have been assigned to the photo .
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time depending on the number of images per unit unit . to select a selection frame can be postponed to this H@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all related pictures are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then this will appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ eb@@ os and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; ne@@ end @-@ search box is a small lamp the green if the search is found . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures appear again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the most advanced search tool is displayed in the rider on the left side with the tel@@ escope . if you open this , you can have a simple search box like the one described above . you can keep this search here as the one described above . you can keep this search here as a search box . after you have been stored in the list , then he was saved in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in the main window . if you want to change your choices after searching again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;

&quot; if you want to delete an existing search out of the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the reconstructed search provides you an expanded search form with many search parameters available , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; publication ; s database can be found . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query within the file database . any rules can be deleted or deleted by using the logical operations all ... , one ... , No ... or minute ... link . in addition , you can search for the type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ HT@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came ; character@@ izes all the picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two of the sig@@ natures , the more they meet . the technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop the same picture . if you can find a picture from somewhere over the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can drop it there . &quot;
sketch : free @-@ hand colour sc@@ ru@@ ze : draw a fast sketch and &amp; publication ; find the matching pictures . also here can be a spon@@ ge .
&quot; this rider provides you with an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ programm . you can press the mouse @-@ wheel inside or out , and move it . push it all the pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to Ge@@ o @-@ data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came , presents a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported imaging formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ tically add from the context menu . if you are back in the window , and then you can open his window . if you are in the publication ; the main window , you can open the lumin@@ ous fast with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the thumb@@ bar , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and put it there . a small arrow shows you which copy of the tool@@ bar , and then take a zoo or sealing operations at one of the pictures , then they will also be running in the other image . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to use quickly from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields below . if you are using pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the areas of the tool@@ bar . now , use the left mouse button in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ ders work directly from the light like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails , which makes it e.g. simply visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each range , you will find a built @-@ in Sch@@ wen@@ ch function , which you can recognize in the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you must click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode preview , both pictures will show the same image . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this occurs in both pictures , when you are in the mode preview . &quot;
what is a digital inventory - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory considers every part of the process which follows the picture was made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos runs out a form of digital inventory through . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we will provide you with a tool , finding a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ ops the &amp; publication ; use . we look at the procedure for digital phot@@ ogra@@ fts , protect , assess , rate , archiving , waiting and export of images . &quot;
&quot; digital inventory takes up , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , protects , transforming , transformed , conf@@ ection@@ able and exported content the one month or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata data is defined as data about data . met@@ adata are provided in accordance with your definition data that will provide information about or documentation of other data which are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you &apos;re looking for more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will not be sure to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how to store the met@@ adata both in a database as well as in the files . you can access the met@@ adata both in a database as well as in the images you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you have to do and you need to have to be organized in your system , as opposed to data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether other access to your photos may have to be saved or on a network drive &amp; etc . be sure that you will have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your memory location . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as contrac@@ tion of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . separate you new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata to save in the entry site of Met@@ adata ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data into the file is written , then you will be able to save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ? it turns &amp; publication ; to give them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should now select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now talk with key@@ word , keywords , as you frequently hot , or categories , as you continue with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gical pictures from another source with embedded words , then &amp; publication came ; automatically the tree for you build b@@ z@@ w the images to another . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; publication ; updated while being the under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows how different met@@ adata . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . file name and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section relates to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; do not want to just let your photos just look , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to get interested in your photo . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from a distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y the 60 years after the landing is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for other things , the title may look more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help the viewer , to help Him via the motif that you move has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine when an image is not perfect when it has the strength to work alone with a cap@@ tion for itself .
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can use it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your pictures to web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the descri@@ p@@ ation and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you will have to tell you the story for the en@@ rol@@ ment not a second time . &quot;
do you remember the times before the GPS ? as you had to find in a different city without the navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures drive the train to the spatial presentation now with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of ge@@ olo@@ cation are already innumerable , and will be able to climb in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can open your journeys by using Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the photos to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . they can also export to the spect@@ ator @-@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word of copyright and calls the practice to use copy@@ rights to prevent restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; publication came ; as a information you should have to be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for brass and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. in order to protect the identity of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may be used . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title : linked to the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples of this may be title as : attachment photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independ@@ ant commercial photographer . as this is an alert to the author &apos;s field , this will also have to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the an@@ bi@@ ologist to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is available for a news agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group / Agency will provide the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , though this is no protection against abuse . each one who has no longer protection against misuse . each of the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image , and in the near future there will be such a module available for st@@ acking processing . &quot;
&quot; themes : record errors , turn@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , descent , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you as traditional pap@@ er@@ photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are going to have problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rolling On@@ track , the largest data reg@@ aining company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight for the problem with CDs / DVDs , you will need to be treated longer than a few years . of course , you can buy CDs and DVDs in archiving quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your occupation room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good mounting instruments and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns the right to select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you were just written only . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect yourself . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . this is why they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . therefore , they use a control mechanism by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to do wonders on CDs and DVDs . it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of def@@ ective dis@@ ks , HDDs , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seems to save the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual Lay@@ er DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs was of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; do you slowly burn out the media with a description , date &amp; author passwords and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; Dis@@ producer reserve your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ error study &quot;
&quot; soon : Dis@@ ks keep the longest in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . some of the SM@@ ART errors are the most common troubles@@ hooting , SM@@ ART can not notice these errors . some of the SM@@ ART errors are the most common troubles@@ hooting . these are especially readers and publishing bodies . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power if you have backed up the files , but these losses usually allow themselves to be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not make a lot of power , this can cause severe damage . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage , complete data loss , hardware age , ne@@ cc@@ ess@@ ary Mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , you can protect yourself from the in@@ ali@@ enable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against power tips is an abundance of power . this is a device that absorbed a part of the energy heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . remember that not any plug @-@ in list contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an exciting protection , then you should be sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against lightning strike and thereby protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage can be used for your computer , you should be sure that all the peripher@@ als can also be protected by telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms . some manufacturers also provide a telephone line for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable @-@ mo@@ de@@ ms and TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore they also contain the protection of the modem . thus , you are ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection , your system will not really help you with a complete failure . even a drop of seconds may result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be sensible to invest in a sub@@ mer@@ ing free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery energy if a black@@ out occurs . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure to store the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , when you purchase a US@@ V you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life @-@ time of the battery and the attached software should be interesting . &quot;
concerns the potential risk that you are exposed to your computer system and compare it with the cost to avoiding this . a high @-@ quality excess protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 cost . this is only a small price difference if you consider how good your computer is protected . at the end you should always think of all the cable before you go into the holidays .
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data to the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com will not be available for online storage services . your free memory is available on 1 GB , and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the supply of a backup and a shared memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safely . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating systems and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says if a transfer error occurred to you . no one seems to open up a photo until you have not thought it in your hardware . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they produce intervals within the data flows . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can be able to deal with turn@@ outs at low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows will be available in English . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms which are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the core .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data loss at the notebook and 46 % in the desktop systems . at not@@ ebooks amounts to the proportion of the theft of 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the meth@@ ists . it leads to a lower damage than for instance theft or new installations , and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sighted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , cancellation , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the wi@@ dening file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the trial process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if however , a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistakes are the major causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ den@@ settings of fundamental physical limits . meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics are no longer far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go ahead in direction of 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ xel &apos;s cameras . even if this resolution is rather deterior@@ ating for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . even , for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format Sens@@ ors ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; so you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a loss of data . thus , you can secure your data after a plan and test it before you do something more dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you daily make your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you are lucky when the drive at the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; a disaster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ tex always means a local storage . bring your backup up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as has been said above , a common reason for a loss of loss despite safeguarding the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files you should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time .
differential securing : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . produces a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the final differential backup .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that has been changed since the last backup . produces several mom@@ entary shots . you can restore the original status at any time , with the exception that it is only sealed , and not continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can set up easily on your machine . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer@@ ral copies r@@ sync only the difference of files the really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important images directly after you stored them on your computer have a DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
&quot; this approach leaves you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come up with a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . every additional di@@ lution should happen manually , after which you made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , original IP@@ TC , original , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ viewing images and met@@ adata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , systems , virtu@@ alization , devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; with this valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; since the future due to your nature is un@@ predictable , all that is said today will be told with caution and re@@ evaluate the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easy it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the technical printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s get out of it that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was recognized by the system , but do not attach it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c / s@@ d@@ b ; the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c / s@@ d@@ b ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , fat@@ 16 , 32 and recur@@ rent &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ marriage if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software gives you the reading it can create this yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
&quot; gi@@ f is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is loss free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend Gam@@ ma@@ - and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , but not as many as TI@@ FF needs and a slow recovery . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures . &quot;
TI@@ FF has been widely used as image format . it manages pictures in high quality but needs very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ format file that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and oblig@@ ated to use met@@ adata . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to problems with the link between the met@@ adata and image file , and how above already noted , the raw format is processed . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to the activities of D@@ C@@ MI and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links , and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a further acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures of the camera , the dealer or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera process , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert pipe files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a subtle processing , you can use external programs . if you entered the pictures again with &amp; publication ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under circumstances by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact with you , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; publication . in paragraph add a photo to an album you &apos;ll find a description , as you can already add on your hard disk . however , you can add many advanced settings to impor@@ ter of images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; publication ; to use , connect it to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , you try to connect with your camera . if this is the case , a full indicator does not appear for a while . if this is the case , the file name will appear and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera appear . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a single application or met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog shows file characteristics and photo information internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . notice that in some digital cameras not all the information available .
&quot; the rider met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer , GPS etc . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection from all . this loads all the photos from their camera to a single album . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were downloaded from the camera before you delete photos of the camera .
&quot; if you want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired using default methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select as soon as you selected the photos , use the button download and then select the chosen page . the button chosen is long , until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; when your camera supports this , an option is available new . these images have not been downloaded yet . in this case , the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in front display . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons all download or use the target album , you will be able to select the target album in which the photos can be displayed . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; publication ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded , you can delete them from the camera by clicking the button . if you only want to delete the button . if you only want to delete some , then you have to select it first and then delete Dele@@ te selected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there &apos;s no possibility to recover if the photos have been deleted from the camera . so you have to delete them from the camera , so you should delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera from the camera , you should do this over the camera game , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as a file name for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive name . this can result in double file name , if you download photos of different frames into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ ino@@ x sub@@ stitutes . if you use this latter option , automatically one folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the photos stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use another data format than the standard format , you can use e.g. in the editing field the pre@@ fix - % % H : % M : % S . place the option date &amp; time to add . for further adap@@ tations you should read the help of the command @-@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; when you use the camera file name , you have the option to download the file name in small letters . or in major case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; publication came ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings to ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; the publication of the camera is available , all the information about the orientation of the camera is ready to carry out . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , leaves &amp; publication ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic spin , use the button and select the automatic spin @-@ rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera has been made available on the photo album . all pictures with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page section , you can check out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; publication ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button below and select the option file @-@ based sub@@ mits at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from their computer to their camera is the button download . then select up@@ loading . file dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files , which are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than a file with default &amp; k@@ de ; methods select . &quot;
&quot; once the picture is done , asks &amp; publication came ; you where the pictures are to be loaded onto . select a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera . select a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the high load . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes that can be performed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to replace an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police office , and property ma@@ kler can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten exactly the photo where exactly the photo was taken , you can post a browser which shows the location . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; publication ; users who want to locate the place of photos therefore , or simply want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to give the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card files are currently supported by using the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical attri@@ bution ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is no camera that has a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers together . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ CS Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can take place with g@@ p@@ sy or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical attri@@ bution . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data of pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and latitude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign of hairy coordinates , which are created e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European road cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details of Europe . &quot;
&quot; there are many settings to access the behaviour of &amp; publication ; there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; publication ; change to these settings , you must select in the menu settings ; setup . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;

&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization of identity and the copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . this data is automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . also with database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym of the photographer : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations , free photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this can be a detailed description on the author , this will also have to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author if this is the image for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group or agency that the image will be available here . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ TC actions save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus , the met@@ adata is also contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; publication ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into account ; imported without any lost sight . &quot;
images store ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments which you add to your photos . this allows you to add to your photos using the images embedded in the images . this can be over@@ written by the texts .

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right from each category .
&quot; the settings of the light of &amp; publication can be set on this page . each time you can open these settings if possible . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can only get using quick computers . if you have one , then you can get this better picture results . &quot;
&quot; by default the image processing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the picture editing can be defined in picture mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and off .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the pictures are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the Far@@ bin@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia to the near@@ er explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files , since P@@ NG requires a loss of loss . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value to a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; using the TI@@ FF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sion@@ age images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . &quot;
&quot; with the setting loss free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files , you can choose losses and file size far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; publication , the picture was only a picture of picture for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default option is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 g@@ ural patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white is not set off . standard , it is a fixed color @-@ balance that has been photographed on a white card that has been photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in the shre@@ w . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the shre@@ w , so the parts of your images will catch up @-@ going white in the settings . use the setting colors generated some unusual results as it shows the shre@@ ws in various horses . last you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the shre@@ w . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . , and d@@ cra@@ w try not to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option , you get the opportunity to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted to each image individually . &quot;
&quot; put the L@@ umin@@ escent worth to your liking . however , you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also later be made in the picture options of the &amp; publication ; to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should advance conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to convert a full picture from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor which provides many cameras and which provides a matrix colour pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ constructions .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w were made available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . it produces as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . it produces as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . it produces as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . it produces as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; when you know the colo@@ uring of your lenses , you can put the red and blue @-@ proo@@ fing values here . this is certainly the best method for a color controller , since you are performed during the rough conver@@ gence . &quot;
&quot; a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how these should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; publication came ; information like the color @-@ formations of a color room to translate in the others , so that the colors are as accurate as possible . &quot;
behavior issues when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with raw files .
color Profile folder here the folder such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / .@@ color / ICC where you can store all your profiles . &amp; publication came ; investig@@ ates this folder during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the rough file later .
&quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are not managed by the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should be in the same way . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain any color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently corrected d@@ cra@@ w Gamma do not exist for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the colour of the colour itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how to print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors might be very saturated . this could be correct , rather than rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it &apos;s pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ als , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image frames and image processing . by providing this interface can be supported ; many modules support that are written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and this will be loaded ; loaded : these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short commands . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can get you over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper re@@ gler should be easy to understand the time between the outputs , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross fields turn the met@@ adata or from that at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of the cameras supported on the right side . on the right side there is one camera that is connected to the computer . beneath that , you are using the Port@@ settings . currently , here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can use the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire cameras . this field will only be active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ ite / or , give your camera on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; publication ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put them in the display mode and switch off . &quot;
&quot; check out whether &amp; publication came ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have installed your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confir@@ ming for moving out &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the conversation of &amp; publication ; in the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ eting of an album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes caused by the right side bar , tac@@ itly can be applied ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you will need to use the changes using the button . &quot;
&quot; you can also submit the ad of welcome imaging of &amp; publication ; in the beginning , this speeds up the starting process of &amp; publication . &quot;
&quot; the setting bi@@ m start to new photos are forcing &amp; publication ; the base folder was looking for new or deleted albums / photos . if something from the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; publication ; you , whether it should delete this from the database . &quot;
&quot; different color schem@@ as can be used , used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can select you under settings design from tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be applied below : &quot;
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; publication ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&quot; the publication includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos , and to correction and improvement . the picture editing can be started by clicking on a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; publication ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the dat@@ ein@@ ame , current date number , magni@@ fying factor and the current size size . &quot;
one menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar to quickly access the most commonly required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the picture editing will change your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saving or the button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have stored the picture . &quot;
so you should be sure to create a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file saving as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re @-@ establish the original image by saving you from the menu File Re@@ manufacture or the button The button re@@ establish the image processing in tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time saving . &quot;
virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can re@@ vert by selecting &quot; Edit back or restored by selecting &quot; Edit restore &quot; from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the back @-@ to @-@ back and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also re@@ vert or recovered . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the picture editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image , or use the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the photo in the photo and out of zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or the symbols in the tool@@ bar , or use the entries in the menu @-@ menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically choose &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want to use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can change this in the booking dialog . you can call this page ; the main window will call ; see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; when you want to print the actual picture , you can print in the menu File picture and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole phrases . whole picture @-@ viewing pages can be selected from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album to export print . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; this &amp; publication came ; the main window has a page bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is displayed , even if one of the five riders will be clicked on : &quot;
multi@@ f@@ aches click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or re @-@ disappear into the edge .
&quot; in the descri@@ p@@ tive view , you can enter let@@ tering with unlimited size or insert . please note that the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
the IP@@ TC data support only AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters limited . all comments are split into 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC marking field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you commented it , you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then stored . &quot;
&quot; besides the use button , there is a button More . with this you can write additional met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files , however , if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting that is always written to the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars , and can be used in Search and Sor@@ ti@@ fications . it can be applied to the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ note shows a search box to the filter of the keywords , the sampling tree , and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; publication ; -@@ session dealt face . &quot;
the sampling tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the password . you can restrict the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word rapidly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is another relief in the input of key@@ word at a picture series . if you have entered different words , they will be stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding cross fields in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the sampling tree , this only applies to the up@@ scale image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , sampling , and view@@ able views . if in addition one or more key@@ note filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two displayed are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard it . suppose you &apos;ve selected several pictures in the main view . if the keywords already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and select on the selection . then a dialogue that you ask whether you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word refers to No keywords , which is reduced the quantity to three images . they were selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that there was a key@@ word from the right cap@@ turing and there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be plug@@ ged under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created , and find that it may be or may be , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry where the database is sought after in the database . this can be an album , name , keywords , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify a survey of all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the cross box at the end of the rule and then to use the button group . the options then look like this : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly got it &amp; publication ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why one can use the colors used by your camera or scanner , which can have the colors used by your camera or scanner . with a colorful work@@ flow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor can match them from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish them from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons you have to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , color management , that you informed informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all six listed below , then you do not have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB farms . ( further information can be found below )
their only other images are per e @-@ mail or the Web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
&quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for everyone is so easy , why should one use another color room and thus have to think about colour @-@ managed ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional Re@@ presentation of all colors we can see the hor@@ ses@@ hoe @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional Re@@ presentation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on information and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
must I have my monitor cold when I decided to work for it only in R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
&quot; yes ! if you &apos;re working in s@@ R@@ GB @-@ colour or not , you need to scale your monitor . if you are working in s@@ R@@ GB , since s@@ R@@ GB this is the circle . if you are working as in the color room of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , you need to use your monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , Ab@@ p , automatic Ab@@ p , and contrast expand from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ ing Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous point across the image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a magic correction for images the dark or washed out .
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ cated the light weight factor in the image of the selected image , so that the H@@ isto@@ gram of the intention is as flat as possible . sometimes , the down@@ right very good results in the improvement of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles with a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic Ab@@ p : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the red , green and blue channel . they determined the dark and light border @-@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green and blue channels on the complete H@@ isto@@ gram range . &quot;
&quot; contrast , this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by changing the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re@@ viewing of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in temporary images and can be a good correction for poor photos . &quot;
the white @-@ right of &amp; publication came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white straight of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ correction correction is somewhat limited to over a color room with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform the white mode in the rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction is better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent , the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start him over the menu colors of white colors . &quot;
&quot; the preview display can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see again the original white , then it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . L@@ umin@@ escent of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is displayed as a vertical line in the H@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; right above , a h@@ isto@@ gram is indicated as soon as you have changed a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful as soon as you have changed a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful as soon as you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful , even in good lighted images , most pixels very small gaps . with one button , you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade of shadow allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also down . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture to use the selected color for the calculation of the white temperature of the white . this way , the temperature and green values are also automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can put the white @-@ off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color @-@ canal over@@ exposed is over@@ exposed .. They will display the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . each setting of the white comparison that you have set you can save it into a text file and re@@ charge later .
&quot; the button preferences pres@@ upp@@ oses all filter values back to its standard values and their neutral white @-@ cell disease . note that in addition , neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the co@@ ding pipes per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . these co@@ ding is also suitable for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of images . it uses the change and instruction of colour pro@@ fil@@ en . colour tone can be performed by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ pers . a detailed guide for the use of colour pro@@ fil@@ en allows you to rate the chapter color management . &quot;
another important tool is available in the menu under colour tone correct . this tool is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and you therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful way to correc@@ ting problems is the tool for the gra@@ dation that you will find under colors of gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; tool colour effects provide four far@@ es @-@ effects , a solar @-@ effect effect , a ne@@ on effect , a ne@@ on effect , and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar , even Sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect of this was created if one had partially developed a short flash light and subsequently completed the colour of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas of darker and the colors were completed by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atively negative of the picture . this tool allows you to j@@ un this interesting effect fin@@ ely . &quot;
the intensity controls solar power . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase will finally create a neg@@ ativity that is not to create on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar @-@ effect effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and the original ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d @-@ Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a sati@@ ation , making it a stronger contradiction effect , which makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ished many photos . &quot;
&quot; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers , especially those who are hardly any landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light to contrasts . the parameter level controls the strength of the outcome and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . with large images , the filter can give the whole CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color @-@ counter and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are used to experiment .
if you make a photo with bad light conditions you can gain the reverse problem : a great choice to reduce satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness is going to increase . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated for the improvement of the expos@@ ing . even if the dialogue to this tool appears very complicated , you need only the field of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , of active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph@@ ene , three sliding are in the inside , and those can be shifted to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture . the following options are available . &quot;
scal@@ ding : with this selection box can be adjusted for pictures of a digital camera . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour contain the linear h@@ isto@@ gram of a single column . in this case the log@@ otype @-@ making use is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently gam@@ ma@@ values called . &quot;
&quot; the three colour pet@@ als can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically remove the input , middle and bright sounds automatically . in addition , there is one button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
the d@@ ga@@ des permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators used for each section . there are also two regul@@ ators used for each section . the compression of the ex@@ ams can be used e.g. for this to create a hidden picture as background while seeing something different in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically placed depending on the intensity values of the picture . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop , using these buttons , the specified values in the file system can be saved and re@@ charged later . the Gimp levels will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and use the three color pet@@ ts , the input will be automatically re@@ ated for all shadows , means and Sundays . enable the color of the h@@ isto@@ gram for red , green , blue , and the lam@@ bs channels . &quot;
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that is that you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the ga@@ des are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynamic in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification Channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel by the module :
&quot; besides this box , there are two icons to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that are recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beams . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further . &quot;
&quot; if you move for example a spa panel to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with darker d@@ ots , and that the associated picture pixel will be darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this markings on the area you want to change , it &apos;s a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down , until the value is j@@ us@@ hed according to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop , using these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is the Gimp &apos;s cam format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create this method and the three color pet@@ ts , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and Sundays . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and bri@@ umin@@ ous curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here , it is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview , and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ Channel . shadow - and Sundays was applied with colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; publication ; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the channel box you can select the color for the H@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first hint about how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target area has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the image , a vertical line appears in the H@@ isto@@ gram to show you the corresponding color . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels as well as if you retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also retain the appropriate color components . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color appears in any channel differently . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion in which you reduce the color first . &quot;
the saving as and shop buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can be used for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel Mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator that is that you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue Channel has been re@@ activated . the original image is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image under ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography has always been fascinating due to your abstraction ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work stage because color pictures can be converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ roll profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film over@@ exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus , like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ filmed : simul@@ ates a black / white film over@@ exposure with an or@@ angen Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air@@ photos . thus , like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ filmed . &quot;
red filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film over@@ exposure with a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dram@@ ati@@ cal cel@@ estial effect and can simul@@ ate moon @-@ nat@@ ured for day time . therefore similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film over@@ exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates warm bright and middle tones while he adds a bit of cold into the womb . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with this &amp; publication came ; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points , or like a wall image on a wall . the menu item displays image texture can be used for this . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : shift this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper phenomenon is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the altered under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with this &amp; publication there came ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set up a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . it is possible to add the module from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired cream type for your image . insp@@ ected the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ it@@ ran@@ ged it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white images ) , Ab@@ p@@ ant@@ et with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is for a button @-@ effect , and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . value area for width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
&quot; the target picture is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool after page ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . use text box , orientation , color from the color room and the character set with its characteristics as you need . you &apos;ll simply select a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ cautious background . you can simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already , the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the picture is saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with this &amp; publication ; tools Sch@@ abl@@ one apply you can put a template over a picture .
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ ones apply in the image processing can be used to place sc@@ rub@@ ons over a picture .
&quot; for the template there is no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should be done with maximum compression ( 9 ) to remove the file size of the template . whom you just want to send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; publication ; mailing list , check @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ tool@@ folder with the button Base folder in dialogue . choose the folder in which you have copied the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ gs . these settings will be announced for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree @-@ view is reflected in the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ gue . selecting a folder updates the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fying the picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; res@@ cu@@ ers : this button res@@ ized the image below . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must drop the image according to it . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to shift the image below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted to automatic size .
&amp; Check has come ; three different tools for depth are available . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ per is a traditional tool for depth . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ary images . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges around a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it works rather more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
Re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
&quot; this is due to the dig@@ itali@@ zation process colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this is because of the dig@@ itali@@ zation process , the same phenomenon makes it a little vulnerable . this , the same phenomenon can be seen when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequent depth as normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
&quot; with JP@@ EG pictures , a camera has often been applied . images in the raw format must always be spar@@ ed during the processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner turn a edge filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can obtain usable results by looking for a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . that allows you to resume using the menu cor@@ rigi@@ dity .
&quot; you should deal with this , however , because the results are not very natural : the most useful technology to sharp@@ ens the edge of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the smo@@ ker . you will reach it over the menu @-@ fixing Re@@ focus . among Re@@ focus you will find further more information and a comparison of all techniques for depth . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cris@@ p . the solution , the image to draw a little soft , is much easier than shar@@ ps . use the tool for soft@@ ness with the menu in return cor@@ rigi@@ ing soft@@ ness and experiment with settings . the preview display on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ k@@ ering is a very good tool to remove the veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . this window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should be tried first . if you make the awk@@ ward mask too strong , smoke and the impression of dit@@ ats near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius poses one like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore you should sharp@@ ens pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image of which the original is added . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference . this way , one can define a minimum change between the tones between shar@@ ps and therefore more beautiful mistakes in faces , He@@ aven@@ ues and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
this &amp; publication came ; tool Re@@ focus focused on an image through improvement of the sharp@@ ness . it used to be protected by the protected discharge of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to zoom as a picture . this is better approach to shar@@ pen@@ ing the photo . this is better approach than just trying the picture to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses better results than un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by using colours Re@@ focus in the image processing .
&quot; in practice the cir@@ cl@@ amp fold much better than the Gau@@ ck &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ck &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel blocks . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ck &apos;s F@@ altung in most cases is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular field : this is the key parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . you can set a higher value when your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red but then pay attention to Heiligen@@ stadt .
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase of the smoking filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is worth the image even further . &quot;
&quot; it is the radius of the Gau@@ ls &apos; edge . in most cases , this is caused to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use this value to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ck &apos; sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the saving as and shop buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any given parameters that you have set will therefore be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to carry out all the cutting , color , and intention of intention on the picture before using the module . &quot;
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image before you change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately that are not immediately visible that leave later in@@ convenient ar@@ te@@ facts .
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , producing un@@ sharp mas@@ ons produces better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ ons as a sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , it is always possible to create un@@ sharp mas@@ ons . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna Filter one can never show that it is the optimal linear filter . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original in@@ sharp color image must be corrected . this picture was made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to enough light for the car @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field of depth of digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator go@@ wn uses the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the area of the dark @-@ wr@@ ist in order to produce more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; the color @-@ tin@@ te enables a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want to blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool@@ correction tool is one of the most widely developed tool to not be able to remove the arti@@ facts with unprecedented arm@@ ell@@ os@@ er speed .
the In@@ struction algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ settings as star@@ ters to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are below re@@ counts :
&quot; if you want to use the filter settings f@@ us@@ hing , you can use the riders to use the rider and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail management &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a less value leads to the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details so that no sharp@@ ness is necessary . please note that the details of the section always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; right value , Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth into all directions , while a value close to 1 is in one direction . if you have a film bas@@ kets or C@@ CD Rob@@ bery , a high value of wave @-@ similar patterns will produce . JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts will be best removed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum se@@ wage factor about all@@ y. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . set this value therefore to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves bigger structures . this is necessary if very much smo@@ ker , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , he must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally here is 1 or 2 out .
&quot; step gradual there &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha small is chosen as well , there should be small chosen as well . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
integrated step span &#91; 0.@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step range in pixel . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only small . it doubles but the run@@ time . therefore we recommend it to let him out .
buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . every adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and loaded again later .
&quot; the errors correct at work is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load after yourself . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the down@@ fall . &quot;
below you can see how picture error made with little arti@@ facts are corrected . as you see there is a strange arti@@ fact that is done in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a strange arti@@ fact that is caused by bad film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; publication came ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce Bil@@ dr@@ au@@ ds . it uses a copyri@@ ghted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove patches with other arti@@ facts , for example from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor rau@@ ts from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ des ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on sensor types of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high level of ISO sensitivity . it shows a bas@@ ni@@ ges smoking which can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and the image can be wounded through the radius specified by the radius , and the color in it is smooth and therefore smaller mistakes . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ens : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . this value raises the filter holes of the filter . if the value is increased , the adap@@ tive filter picture can no longer be preserved and smo@@ ker or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
edges : control the edge @-@ precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value enhances the frequency of the fil@@ th . if it is too strong can not occur the whole smo@@ ker or cr@@ ush @-@ pointed can occur . put it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove an alert or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing detail .
light density : controls the ligh@@ tness of the image . we recommend either to change color or light density to improve one image . these settings do not affect the process of using the details settings by the details settings .
color : controls the color @-@ tolerant of the image . we recommend either to change color or light density to improve one image . these settings do not affect the process of using the details settings by the details settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the darker sections , which typically be stronger , but also the down@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ t@@ amping . this value defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the light density . if he is lifted up , the edges can occur . if he can appear to his minimum , smokers can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the spac@@ ecraft which you have set , can be stored in the file system and loaded later . &quot;
this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) marked with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tools to make the picture a little soft with the menu entry . use the thumb@@ nails on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; publication came ; photo rest@@ or@@ ation is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease phot@@ oc@@ te@@ fak@@ te .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove pictures , film bas@@ kets , scrat@@ ches , compression rates and local errors in digital , original , or subsequently digit@@ alized images to remove . the smooth@@ ing is carried out along the image and thus receives the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ elling and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas it &apos;s not very far away . as a loss of low @-@ pres@@ sion@@ ing sal@@ g@@ elling , he produces a few compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts ; - small standards to see the un@@ compressed image . this setting shall correct these problems . &quot;
buttons Save as and shop make exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ or@@ ation can be saved into a text file and loaded again later .
&quot; photo rest@@ or@@ ation is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load after yourself . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce as a photo with equ@@ ating smo@@ kes . the module is applied to a black and white photo with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film bas@@ kets on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was used to see the scan of the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the Fot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . this is the original image under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos with a C@@ CD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi Project , protected by Martin Dick@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality mode photos , as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen saver method , there is no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file to the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through C@@ CD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture , and this automatically loads back to the next session . &quot;
the picture area and the preview will help you correct the result . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted out in all events .
select an area around the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighbouring pixels . the resulting color will be assigned to all broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear ben@@ ds ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ l the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. , under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; far @-@ angle objective , in particular the middle and large photo format , often the entire sensor area , can often reduce the entire sensor area . instead , and quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; instead , by taking the light that the sensor can be achieved there . &quot;
&quot; but it also has disadvantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the filter filter , which should be impossible to hold the camera with the hand . for@@ bi@@ ble object , even with Center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects arise by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure of digital cameras and movie scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by digital camera cameras and movie scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter by using a c@@ enter@@ filter . the algorithm is copyri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three revisions , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier filter and with three more the exposure of the destination . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light scanning at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which compens@@ ates the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of the target image with this option reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you have to only provide positive values for you as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want more subtle the target of the target , let the values for illumin@@ ating / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; publication ; image processing from the menu of color gra@@ dation . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image is applied . the original image ( 1 ) displays the correc@@ ting image . a lamp @-@ stronger and contra@@ sting frame has also been carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; publication came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
&quot; this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ der treats the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third party has a similar broad@@ casting effect , but fla@@ p on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the distant corners to the one of the second gra@@ ft . if you combine these two geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second Gra@@ des . with negative values able to be ton@@ ed @-@ shaped distor@@ tions are corrected and positive values cus@@ p @-@ shaped distor@@ tion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion . this value affects more to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value scale the image size new and thus leads a correction first gra@@ des through negative values while positive the image decreased .
bright : this value j@@ us@@ ted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
the t@@ ame or cus@@ hion correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . the best lead you to the correction as all the first . if you cut a picture anew and then make a tone @-@ shaped correction if the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool will provide a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection you can fix the t@@ ame / cus@@ p @-@ shaped distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; correct the resulting image of black corners will have the resulting image black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu , cut off from image processing , or over the zoom re@@ control of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the tone @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ ared film . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ared film . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; in the window &apos;s left , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can edit two parameters using film bas@@ kets and film sensitivity . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of film bas@@ kets and the dominance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter colour channels can reproduce by infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the Far@@ bin@@ ations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ ared profile from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a sort of au@@ ra in the shre@@ w .
&quot; the publication , the publication came ; filter film bas@@ kets is a simple to use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your images such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . this is the result of classical high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . this is the manufacturer &apos;s sensitivity to raise large pieces of silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mono@@ chro@@ med photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ulates of the Kör@@ ner can be calibr@@ ated . the standard value is although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , so you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the cinem@@ atic effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; publication came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; publication came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and style are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top is choosing the brush size between one and five . thicker brus@@ hes are better for large images . smooth controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , is seen . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processed is marked with ( 1 ) and the one worked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth@@ te 17 .
&quot; the view came to create a coal @-@ readable designation ; the lines that determine slowly are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would have good pictures to start with .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator chooses the base size , and the contrast j@@ us@@ hed the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used , the result can be improved even further by adaptation of the intention . &quot;
the &amp; publication came ; filters engra@@ ved your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was j@@ umped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in terms of content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ olith@@ ic landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ ting effects . it uses copyri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and lets it look like it is seen through glass beads .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to wave blocks 1 is distorted the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculation and create a high CPU load . you can break this effect at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to an artwork by means of dis@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copyri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that go from a central point of view . this simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image through turning the pixel to a center . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal : wi@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ consistency of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft dis@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ot@@ tel@@ un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ g@@ out the picture through random shift of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a random camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ g@@ gle these without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a n@@ ap appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
trou@@ gh size allows the size of the dri@@ p to change . because the dri@@ ppers are not automatically necessary with the size of the image . number changes the number and density of drops . fish changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can select with the &amp; publication ; image processing a range free of shelves . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which is to stay free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the shelves filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; when the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers . &quot;
photo infl@@ en is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture is easy . the big question is , how can you find an image infl@@ atable and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
when a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size using the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and give the target values . the dialog is below to see .
&quot; the tool to the size uses linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try to infl@@ ate the tool . &quot;
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; publication came ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are counted below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original size is maintained in the input of the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves bigger structures . this is necessary if very much smo@@ ker , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , he must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
buttons Save as and shop are used accurately . every single photo for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later again .
&quot; photo infl@@ en is very fast when making it , but it can last very long and take a high CPU load after yourself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see an example of photo bub@@ bles , by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original ( 2 ) is the result of linear , standard enlargement to compare . &quot;
&quot; the cut @-@ cutting of a photo is not just a common operation with the mouse , but also a common tool to put together a picture . to cut a picture with the mouse , simply create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button , and pull up the spelling of the spelling . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you let go again the area of photos gets cut out . therefore , you can change the size of the size to cut area by stopping at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by clicking it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the fe@@ eder button , use the button The Zu@@ cut de button in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or file saving under the menu file to store the newly cro@@ pped photo . &quot;
&quot; in the view area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners by the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in tool ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format width is allocated . &quot;
&quot; the tool also uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use centimeters , incl@@ ine or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons exist to cent@@ red the choice automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can use the Max . Rati@@ o to the area to cutting the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool @-@ cutting tool saves its settings depending on the orientation tool ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tic@@ al ) . if you use the cutting tool , these settings are stored as standard dimensions depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data is re@@ viewing the image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the arran@@ ging help allow them to put them better together so that you can put your pictures better together . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of similarity . like the third @-@ party gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles with the di@@ agon@@ als . &quot;
Golden Center : the Golden Center is a partition which is related to various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the flas@@ hes of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 34 , 21
the golden middle is provided for liquid relief lines if you put an image together . these support are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ party gel , the golden spiral produces the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral , and created on this way a symm@@ etrical visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the legality of the golden spiral , also called Golden Spir@@ als . it should be a line that can be a line or different objects . this is something that can only be there without the eye , it will fulfill its purpose . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles also direct from the above mentioned golden spiral corner . they are aware that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are no equivalent triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can be a static object dynam@@ ical appeared . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden triangles to use your frame , create a effect that is called by professional photographers of dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your picture focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise . &quot;
the options Horiz@@ ontal reflect and Ver@@ tik@@ al can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . this way , you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn an image around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you &apos;re not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image where things are shot ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . you can choose to choose free rotation and j@@ us@@ hing the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button preferences , you can set the sli@@ der again at 0 degrees . a preview of turning is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right side . &quot;
&quot; to your help , the Module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture to position the two lines . move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now let you describe the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have filmed an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is to cut automation . select one of the following options :
&quot; the option for anti @-@ ali@@ asing , the image is a bit after the spin . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ tive transformations are carried out by a point of reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will automatically be charged . on the right side of the dialogue you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transforming area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective , the image becomes a little wasted . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ seen tri@@ angular holes to the corners . a possibility to adjust this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from image processing .
&quot; the melting tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part in the opposite . the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into an parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module over transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; remove your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically . if you push preference , the angle is placed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the template to fix your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the shot , the image will disc@@ ard a bit . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sets generated twice as much as well and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after finishing the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from image processing .
&quot; a number of libraries and other packages have been posted to read and write image formats . therefore , a number of libraries and other packages depends on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images with &amp; publication . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all files available on your system . but you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF underneath it . &quot;
&quot; the publication in the list is listed , shows only files in formats . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is displayed . you can change this list of file exten@@ ders , and you can change this list . in the section configuration you will find further information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the user format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; publication came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data composition procedure on digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save this way the bil@@ dd@@ esses to a more efficient way .
&quot; JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results as JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read the raw material pictures in English and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw material images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw model , you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; publication . &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which was contained in &amp; publication ; this is where all support cameras can be supported on the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats that came by &amp; publication ; supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . this clips are frequently stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format , but is not a film processing programme and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to indicate or edit . if you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies can be used to play the program . &quot;

&quot; if you do the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ als contrast is very good , then you can perform the first four directions using the white @-@ right module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; publication ; included . their description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ens , soft sign , rob@@ bery , rec@@ alling , un@@ sharp mask , which is applied to the current image before the filter is applied . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user @-@ quot ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress of progress shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode now . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to be applied to the area on the right of the selected range .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected range .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the mouse , if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . used colors can be adjusted in general settings .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and take the part of the image you want to see . the preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all set @-@ up from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely in@@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when these are available .
&quot; this rider provides you with an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ programm . you can press the mouse @-@ wheel inside or out , and move it . push it all the pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images to Ge@@ o @-@ data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for choosing and using colours .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either apply to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color , and finally used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or browse the folder . &quot;
cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by folding to the area next to a color .
it shows the colour in addition . the color is described below the p@@ allet view . here can also be changed the color name .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to one color to move the cursor there . then , move the mouse at hand left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the ou@@ ting box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color @-@ board at the cursor . the color is inserted either , or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check@@ box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color follows three values for the parts of red , green and blue and an optional color name , in case another color follows . if so , three number values are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the range and output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; choose a color somewhere on the screen , and then find them in the colo@@ uring on the left side . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Graphi@@ cs : a K@@ DE program is used in science , in particular in the inform@@ atics ; so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph . previously , there were no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize grap@@ hing . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphical viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ graph@@ ene ; displays are free with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of grap@@ hing in &amp; K@@ ate ; graphs re@@ comp@@ ress and g@@ graphical ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
download large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to present more than these knot@@ s )
further required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; required for the representation of the graph@@ ene . needs to be used in detail :
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph , each in a separate sub@@ window . in the case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse wheel ( high and down without special , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
&quot; zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below , you can see the maximum reduction of a graph . &quot;
&quot; when the file is currently in &amp; graphic , loaded file from another program , the following window appears : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h wants to be re @-@ loaded or if you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can edit the menu item page graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a Graph@@ end@@ ance outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; or to open the graph in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as in the last option , you can permanently store your choice but also change it with the furniture dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . once again , you can save your choice both and later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph will be plug@@ ged into a page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
&quot; page show with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line , and with another font &quot;
&quot; the page again charging gives the ability to set the behavior when a file is changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the opportunity to set the behaviour of &amp; graphical viewer ; set if a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( grap@@ hing in a new window , or determine in a sub@@ window of already current session ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site administration gives the opportunity to set up the start @-@ behavior of &amp; graphical viewer . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , at any start to be asked . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphical algorithms ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms choose . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for targeted graph@@ ene . it produces a hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tion of oriented graph@@ ene . the algorithm lays the edges into the same direction ( from top to right or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few c@@ utt@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces portra@@ y@@ als in the spr@@ ing@@ case . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional scal@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ ray model @-@ model layout . it uses the frustration of net @-@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ stroke trigger for the treatment of large and ge@@ ural grap@@ hing . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm type the node @-@ shaped , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and wedge and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which you can specify a layout text file , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should give you a layout as a parameter , and the calculated layout of grap@@ hing after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . the command should give you a filter , or even the grap@@ hing with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ous ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for oriented , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invali@@ d graph@@ ene ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cursor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further assistance to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available from this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows the GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image and edit . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spherical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo , to loc@@ alise . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude are being used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu on . the top correlation about time and loc@@ alisation , then you need to load a sp@@ ur@@ file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time taken at the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
when the file loaded a automatic correlation of the coordinates are recorded in red @-@ time . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera is to be carried out with the GMT . place your camera channel zone .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . it is the devi@@ ation below , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no sp@@ ur@@ data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then be able to cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ing and differential in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have any appropriate data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation in a great time difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place , as the dialogue will only use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ alization can also be found and set up . select the relevant area and enlarge this again . select the relevant region and enlarge this again . the height can always be selected manually . the card can always be selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery drawn from HTML pages form to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will allow UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all of the albums select to choose according to HTML . you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the alleg@@ ation and text of the text appear in the head of the HTML page will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you click on an image , a new page will be displayed in the image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery shall be saved with all your related images . select a folder on the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ Export Export , which includes everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
with other color depth you can change the standard color @-@ depth . of course the file size is also possible . all other settings are in@@ explic@@ able .
&quot; the rider pictures allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press breaks to break the process .
if the module creates the pages the window does not automatically closed . you can therefore start the program to determine if mistakes occur during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press Connect to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I portrait is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I ima@@ gery allows it to watch a selection of pictures and perform on them bas@@ operations such as turn@@ outs , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used in short image and quick access to his functions . &quot;
after the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the promotions listed below , pictures in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss of losses is it the file size rises , since no compression of the Far@@ bin@@ aries takes place . this can also be found at the P@@ NG Format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect for the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor does not currently use documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy the data from one image to another , so you want to copy the picture file on . this will then copy the file dialog with which you want to copy the file image . the data will be copied after you pushed to the button OK . &quot;
this function does not work in all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slides .
&quot; the module MPEG co@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , using a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct video format . in addition , you can choose the DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / CD CD / CD CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must first select the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start using Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module . &quot;
the pictures selected by you are then listed below the files in the portfolio . you can also change sor@@ ting the images or the content of the list .
&quot; once you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that will indicate a picture . the speed of the picture is set below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high against it is very smooth . &quot;
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let them be black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the ends as possible as possible .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio file , you can boot this into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can boot the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go coffee or enjoy a coffee , and enjoy the Di@@ asch@@ au if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the button settings on the right below . &quot;
the printing super@@ visor allows multiple images to print together in standard Photo@@ sizes . this can also be opened automatically with image processing . this is e.g. useful to improve your or using the Gimp module for direct expression .
&quot; using this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your pictures into one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original condition of Him is : expect of d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera player . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w imaging window appears then in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now optimize the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be j@@ us@@ hed . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to process the image later . &quot;
a quadru@@ ple R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contract information . in case your camera has been working in the R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats , and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the losses free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your images or later on , you shouldn &apos;t choose the JP@@ EG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the picture quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start using the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , so you can break down . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ kli@@ fts mode mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . therefore , use this mode for sure , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if this has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview of progress shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all pictures in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting score , and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the used . &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image res@@ tra@@ int or enlarge . these are four types of images to be made available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size changes in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 . ) : size changes in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not propor@@ tionally : dis@@ proportionate size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
&quot; printing preparation : preparing the picture for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print solution and size of the photo paper . the user interface , including back@@ size , size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the extra pictures before . further pictures can be drawn to the list of the images to collect and disc@@ ard it .
&quot; after you started the module , the images are displayed with the pictures selected by you . over the button images you can add more pictures to the button . for the most recently selected image will be displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also pull pictures on the picture list and add it to you to add the list of images to you .
&quot; with the button images , the selected images from the list of images are removed . &quot;
after you selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . you have to add here as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the receipt e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and each time uses it until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; following the selection of comments in a decent file , the comments will be added to the images into a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG Format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted under the loss of photo files . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original exc@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . you can leave this window in the window . &quot;
&quot; after launching the module Fort@@ ress Fort@@ ress , a window appears with questions like you have shown your slides . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are enabled very elegant images via OpenGL . however , you need to possess an appropriate graphic card , because otherwise the slides will be very slowly . &quot;
the option file display indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame displayed images will be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop @-@ loop . you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; under delay between images , the temporary distance between the single images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . so , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should be the best before you show the presentation to your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly chosen to select another effect between the pictures .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen , move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
this tool@@ bar allows you to stop the presentation and start again the previous and the next picture and stop the slides .
&quot; on the left side of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ hes have no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect for the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background picture is a tool to put an image as the background picture for the working surface .
&quot; this module is currently placing selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have attached your pictures and videos with comments , you can view your pictures and videos with comments , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group of keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you &apos;ll see the categories , for which you entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described . &quot;
&quot; when you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the pictures are shown on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view images with thumb@@ nails , to view the pictures of your impact . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol before their name . you can save on &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; but for each person a self @-@ view image , which is of course also defined for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view pictures beside the name , select the button that you want to use the right area on the tool@@ bar . in the relevant context menu , you can choose which view can be used for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of key@@ word ( if you do not have suitable images ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must see which picture will be displayed for each individual person . to see this , you will be able to select the picture @-@ out windows ( described in closer ) and select the appropriate item for the appropriate person . here , you can adjust the picture to the appropriate factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; when you call in the main window the entry search , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialogue of the image properties . this dialog allows you to look at the picture once more . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string to the panel or description , the marking or descriptions of the pictures will be brow@@ sed . if you want , you can also enter a date for example , for example in 1971 , or complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as in 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all pictures for certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick , the screen photos and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first dialogue , if you start &amp; a photo@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu on CD photo@@ album ; for the first time , some example pictures are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; see the Tim@@ eline . as the name already says , this list shows you file statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display several different time units . each track can then show a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used on the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview of the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in preview ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by clicking the mouse button , and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . when you select an area , you &apos;ll see the selection only in the preview view . you can select the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; presents two possibilities available to create HTML websites with your pictures . one is available in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; integrated in the following part of the user manual , which you can create HTML ... you can call using the File HTML menu . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are described in the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following each area is described more accurately . &quot;
first enter the title of the over@@ lap and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on col@@ on album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be seen on the overview page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in .
&quot; finally , you can select that information displayed on the HTML pages are obvious . therefore , you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed . therefore , all images may be exported . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain points . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , so that this is not specially received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . therefore , those who have viewing your website and own a monitor that will have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer can change at any time you have set up the resolution at any time . so it can lead your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if it would like to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , you set the different folder and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best select for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you will need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically completed for future images . this folder you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is visible to viewers . if you choose URL for the basic folder , a web browser , after the pages will be launched . if you specify this folder , the URL should be this folder . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files you have not yet to copy it to the final target folder you need to copy them manually . therefore , the import function , see correctly , you need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the only described settings are all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you set into output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for a family celebration , a conference or anywhere else with other users of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can of course create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . you can of course create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . you can of course create a HTML page for viewing the pictures , etc . , then you have to get into the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; cold album ; this work does not even turn again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; cold album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it , whether the images are stored in the file , or whether the images can be saved into the file . the obvious downside is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in two times . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . it is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for the export of images described above the menu file ... you can call . &quot;
the main option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . it will provide you with the following three choices :
&quot; with the option to copy it into the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option automatic to the .@@ k@@ in file copy , copied &amp; box album , the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is also worthwhile not the files to be compressed . if you want to nevertheless wish to comp@@ ress the option to comp@@ ress the option export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you might want to send pictures to your friends , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by , for example , that each image is supposed to be up to 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the endo@@ .@@ k@@ im from the web browser , or from the menu file impor@@ ters ... select , becomes &amp; cold album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to impor@@ ter consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are asked for the category individuals of the imported file person@@ er ( if you are a D@@ ining ) , while this category is to be imported in your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window , which are the categories of imported to imported file and which categories will correspond to this in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can remove the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this you can see on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it needs to be easy to browse and watch : if you look at pictures , you often want to watch out pictures &amp; m@@ d@@ ash if you want to view images of your Italy holiday and want to discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) finding the information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) the search and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for administrators of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual will be talked about images , but frequently this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in the CVS , secure where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; enter the folder in which your images are stored and use this for future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you can start another database in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; for example , a different folder @-@ tree with pictures , you can start with the option -@@ c . as an example : photo@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; about the menu entry settings module , setup ... come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will find the different settings . &quot;
&quot; links you will see six different symbols , with which you can access settings from the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which allows you to access the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it has been described in you as you can specify for every picture , such as individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; in view the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of an intermedi@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options available to you are available to you to select the member groups . with the above mentioned selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; it shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as checking K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called by the menu modules . the modules can be called and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used by several applications together with each other , it may be very little tested using the demo database , just before you test the demo database with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album &quot; &quot; demo album &quot; &quot; page &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would have not warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications , which use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , allowing it to be some modules with &amp; cold album ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that are also using K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this type of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order after albums so you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this simul@@ ates &amp; cold album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , i.e. all the images that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here , &amp; nbsp album is presented ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will have the category that you have set in setting dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , if you use the category individuals , will be used &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; so if you had selected people to view the module and pass this on . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are compatible with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start to setup dialog and select in the area modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
on the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; cold album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will be able to browse the window above . at the moment , you will find the window that you have no information about your images below . in the section we will return to this window , now click on the entry images , which shows you an overview with all the available images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes , which is included in the picture , etc. you can put all your image at the same time , either individually or for a larger number of images , at the same time , and all pictures in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view three lists with a text box by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use it again , when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is drawing up the pictures within the list : if you have a family party , and in all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can therefore find that the names used to move faster and assign people faster . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting on date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you selected comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case , click on the front and back buttons , which are under the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item menu item on once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an Over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context @-@ menu of the reading of properties , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also add an entry to a category and add it to a sub@@ category of this application . respect , this requires you just to sort of your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;

&quot; you can also complete a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and then click here a window . you will see this process in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser you receive an overview with thumb@@ nail pictures of currently selected images , or all pictures in case you have no filter . an example can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply down dial the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it just times . &quot;

&quot; you can also delete pictures from the images you want to delete . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete or choose from Edit selection . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album for this problem . you can also use the pictures somewhere , so you can record the images anywhere in the database . in the picture you can view the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the disk . &quot;
&quot; images , with which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails can be seen . however , you can view these images , but you can view these pictures as well . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and again . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you want to have a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , then select the pictures so that you are left for others , and click the menu of privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that may see your little sister , con@@ ta@@ xing and the menu entry all except current view . &quot;

&quot; it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to the un@@ locking of the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the menu of privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this picture protection is not very safe to read or delete the password being inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . this kind of password protection is only used to read the password as un@@ encrypted text , which is not very familiar to the password as un@@ encrypted text ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can describe all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours for hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason , it features a picture and video views . you can preview them from the preview as described in . &quot;

&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image does not show zo@@ om@@ t . with the simultane@@ ity , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the picture . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that are working in and out .
&quot; with the swi@@ vel menu from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the actual picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
when you look at pictures it can happen to put you a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . you &apos;ll be able to view this name and look at it . you will perhaps prefer to mark the picture and consider more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer . to see what photos you want you can start the spect@@ ator with the pictures and watch them as good or bad while visiting one by one .
&quot; for the two examples of the above , the viewer offers the possibility to provide pictures with features , while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic that you can press the appropriate letter . in view an image where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have put features on your pictures , they are available in the browser . so , if you have selected all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then you just add all at once with notes . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or what ever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the view view . if you can display categories in D@@ re view , then you can add characteristics to the images by pressing the character , after the image was chosen , you can see here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; cold album to paint on the picture .
&quot; the painting is not saved with the image , but in the database . you can re@@ vert your old @-@ old later . &quot;
&quot; in you can see an image on the painted . around the painting mode from &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . to finish the mouse , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to fully control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully master@@ ed , but the documentation is to be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the lens Properties and display the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already are selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert in the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following folding menu appears , so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have modified properties , click to apply these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , you will be displayed a message description . then you can click on the input errors and click on it . then you can click on the input errors or push the changes with break down . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the furnishings dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the object with the help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the self @-@ opinion view . &quot;
&quot; press on preview in the peculiarities view and a small example of the scene will have been selected with the chosen texture . if you want only one part of the texture you want ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
&quot; the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot;
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the controls will disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and spin as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
each object has a visual level of visual acu@@ ity . you can indicate this value relatively to the level of visual object or as absolute value . items will only be displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the level of visual acu@@ ity .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a window order as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it any number . you can also save several windows of windows and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a single view , drag the initial water to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows then the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the beginning to another view . you can then switch between views through clicking on the top @-@ hand side of the views in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window of window are pending views : views , which are not embedded in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the initial water to the desktop or click on the small to the left of the above arrow in the fibre bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fibre bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for every kind of views . new views are narrow ; you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it will be displayed in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be correctly installed . when this manual was written , was &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ der@@ ers icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu in the menu . &quot;
&quot; a ro@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s file size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many r@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full models in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in tool@@ bar or select in the menu R@@ ender modes ... choose , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it is a name that lets the properties of the mode can be seen . &quot;
&quot; in the Kar@@ tei@@ card size , you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you want to use only a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the image in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for a model with complex diff@@ user illum@@ ination . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . this goes from a very simple color and light @-@ model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . this goes from a very simple color and light @-@ model to a model with complex diff@@ user interface . &quot;
&quot; when an image is lo@@ osed with only one beam up the pixel , there can be different mistakes . these images often do not appear if they are smaller than a pixel in representation . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing in order to decrease the influence of these errors . generally see images with this property better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam up the pixels . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adap@@ tive , not @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is increasingly divided again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ed colour depends on the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray sends a beam . if the difference between the colo@@ uring is charged with super @-@ sampling , then both pixels will be calculated through the pursuit of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the low value of 4x@@ 4 additional points , with a lowering of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values the pre @-@ given threshold , then the pixels will be split into 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be pursued separately and be tested on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the low@@ ly value . &quot;
&quot; another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount , to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for the diff@@ use of light re@@ flexi@@ on , it takes very long to leave a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this mapping card , you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object hit . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to import , select the menu entry file impor@@ ters ... and select in the dialog window a file . &quot;
&quot; currently , supports &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if at the impor@@ ters of error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object to import text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on assistance in the Fe@@ atur@@ ts view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the object and the Pov@@ ray ; user documentation for the indicated object . place the path to your document tion and version . you will be supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first missing file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color will be used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type label .
&quot; you can set the object start of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values make a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the shown objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level of detail for two directions separately . &quot;
&quot; when you cross High Detailed views on extended proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections views are further divided if the camera will use an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
when you cross wall display a wall behind the objects is lo@@ oted . the wall is represented in a chess bre@@ w pattern of two adjustable colors .
&quot; when you cross the ground , a ground below the objects plu@@ cked . the soil is represented in a chess bre@@ eder pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick edge @-@ box , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more accurate information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can modify existing windows of shut@@ ters , or create new shut@@ ters . in the section window rules , how to create windows and can save . &quot;
the combination of standard window order : displays all existing windows orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing windows orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected order using the button removal .
&quot; each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear , and must not be empty . &quot;
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can delete you with the button Add and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right hand side of the existing window , with mapping card , you will receive a car@@ tei@@ card view together with the previous view and ch@@ ain@@ tly anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a drunk window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate scene , very popular with beginners : a bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully note the following warnings , before you complain that you get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get just a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have all error @-@ free , you will see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following &quot; &quot; window of window &quot; &quot; : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols for now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu logging . therefore , you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when they click on , see the content of the lens Properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later tut@@ orials , but note that you can change the camera point in the view . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; if you apply the button or press the input button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting endless body qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a real method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; provides in fact a simple way . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and press the button and then use the button bar . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , even if at the moment only a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level stretches back to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can click the entry for the bottom . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the ground to exercise a unit among the horizon line , just allow you to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the ground in order to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue will be displayed in which you can select how the object is to be inserted in the object tree . you can change the name in the self @-@ term view ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview as the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you can still enter the colors for the pig@@ ment . you can now use the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you see in the preview no color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button first and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now correct . if you have a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color . you have further settings . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this too much more frequently , but the chess @-@ board color can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
&quot; this step is already easy to run , as you should have already understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as simple as to create the floor : &quot;
in the view of the lens Properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( do not forget the ball through the floor . otherwise the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor around one unit down .
&quot; of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now point a material . as already in the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose Er@@ stes Sub@@ object and change the name for example in the ball @-@ pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then select then and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can reach extra effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the input button or press the input button .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfectly for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully you have already learned so much you can create , but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is an R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you indicate a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ ame hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , the scenes ) through the objects are reflected and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how to have atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be en@@ ched , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be added to this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
puts the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry can only then select if you have not saved changes in the scene .
repeated the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only then select if you have used editing .
&quot; saves the current window order and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool . you can add and remove it using this option tool@@ tip for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to smo@@ other surfaces without needing any b@@ aking on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geom@@ etrical shapes that are used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , through application of a image file as a color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture @-@ looking and -@@ browser . the application has a file browser which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files which you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button will return .
you can set whether any image will be displayed in your own window or if all images are always used to use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file in your browser window . then a small input field is found in the lower corner . if an appropriate fil@@ en@@ ame appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; set in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five mapping cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two other , short commands and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective windows can be set . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when entering the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , also here the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can see &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be upgraded to the full screen . this option is enabled as a default setting . &quot;
determine if the sli@@ deshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected picture .
&quot; the time span between the portrait of a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ ps is set to 0 . this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it will be interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the car@@ tei@@ cards short@@ cut for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the part @-@ part of the file system with folders and files in a window around .

the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not treated particularly .
&quot; to add an image to an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ sch@@ aus@@ can and then start scanning for the final scan . the pre @-@ made can start through the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can select in the image and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom that the complete preview is fit into the window . &quot;
when the picture was chosen then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if you choose to preview a preview display in the settings then the image is displayed in a preview , as below is displayed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? will lead to a departure and you will come back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the button settings , the set @-@ up dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the image , if desired to see the option before saving . in this case , the option will be selected for storing a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be deduc@@ ted . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; images store . dialog to save for each image will open the dialog before each c@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; this automatically file with a generated name in one previously defined folder then you must save saving without a file name .
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures are stored at the option without a file name . if the pictures are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for the dialog to save . the standard value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically storage images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . the automatic stored image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time , when a picture is saved . the string # # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adapt the quality of image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the standard value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; the button over starts the K@@ DE Over -@@ Dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialogue for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; to finish .

you may possibly setup existing multimedia keys that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; using your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general features , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP @-@ function break could be &amp; eg ; look like this : &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ lines options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has still some own command @-@ lines options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so that the user notes why a script does not run . &quot;
&quot; Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is with for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or they can easily extend the functions required . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which , each K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow the output of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simply inv@@ aded the function ex@@ ec . here &apos;s an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason scripts should monitor their standard input continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . to save the setup and store the furniture data . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now be used &amp; eg ; with D@@ COP functions more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer of 0 to 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu Tit@@ le Dis@@ counts the path to the selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be used . to remove an entry again you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stopped , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M is to do so . for example , this signal should be processed to do example . for example , the store of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which can be charged with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which can be op@@ tionally downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ le modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and download the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and nevertheless is surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can easily move into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus in your collection . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title made of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting browser and the Quick Search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already won some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is still difficult for you . and if you decide the decision , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used so that SI@@ E can choose to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and ven@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when compile it . if you encounter problems , please report this to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , like most applications have a few options , which can enable or disable the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated de@@ bu@@ cket symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help develop &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up with trouble via the furniture dialog . the furniture dialog has several mapping cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
&quot; player window will display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
voting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option cle@@ ars the experimental function of the m@@ oods .
&quot; atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , it is compiled . this will be the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; throw files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . if this setting is activated , the .@@ To files in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; saved ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started , when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browsers : here you can indicate the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; playlist to save , saves the current playlist automatically when loading &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths to manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , depending on the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved . &quot;
the current piece of piece changes visible that the play@@ lists windows asc@@ ended - / removable to keep each of the current pieces always in the visible window area .
&quot; when changing the context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the section image you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section , you can select the use of different writings in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . you can select scripts for the following areas : play@@ lists windows , player window and context browser . push the box ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ ment of choice and can specify a separate color scheme . do not use the contents of the contents for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; playing at the start continue that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback automatically with the piece at the place will continue with which she was stopped at the end . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click here ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross @-@ cross @-@ shade ensures that the text in the OS@@ D sh@@ aded is displayed .
own colors will use the ability to adapt the OS@@ D colors for font and background . a click on the color @-@ surfaces will open the dialogue for color choice . if self @-@ colors use not activated the pre @-@ specified &amp; k@@ de ; colors used .
the Display field display text presents the text in the OS@@ D text . through the input of space the OS@@ D can be adjusted to the needs of the OS@@ D . below you will find a list of available spaces and what they mean .
&quot; the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can specify , on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment , the OS@@ D should appear . &quot;
the Kar@@ tei@@ Card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate further settings in this mapping card .
the Kar@@ tei@@ card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in addition to his name . this section also contains references fields to setup , as should be done with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folder , browse : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders to music is as well . &quot;
changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; allowing the selected folder to be monitored on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore an incre@@ mental search is made to make the necessary changes to your collection .
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok , all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ eness and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the play@@ lists automatically appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part of the collection database is used to choose a database for the collection . the combination box driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , there is another institution in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql establishment needed . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ establishment section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it is used under Port : the network port , where the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
&quot; the diamond card is loaded . &amp; Amar@@ ok , the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m is a . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can submit the names of played pieces on a load . f@@ m @-@ Server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
split up pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activ@@ ating this setting becomes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters will see each piece . note : you can use the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a load @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ delicate packages ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we wrote a small guide , as you compile K@@ delicate minimal . &quot;
&quot; some features such as OS@@ D pre@@ fers that your window manager will work out for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ delicate and Q@@ t , because these constitute an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the cap@@ ut@@ te file that causes the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is that Tag@@ lib is pl@@ ain@@ ted by reading the Met@@ a @-@ Infos from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then results in the editing of the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable automatic . switch , if in@@ active for ... into the adjustment of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it comes to a frequent crash , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be resolved . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that a lot of program write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 , but does not identify as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; = use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols are easily forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click on the Control De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . this can be seen in some cases up to three times a symbol , until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : fatal symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel : invisible symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel : invisible symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel : invisible symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel : invisible symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf that Amar@@ ok can first find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems arise by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or in the developers . use them for this to use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Canal # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if something is located at the removal of an error in Amar@@ o@@ ok itself .
&quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist . how do music appear there ? &quot;
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively the start was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces on the playlist of the playlist and select column review . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column review . click anywhere in the new application column to use the review for a piece . you can also use the short@@ listed Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then push compensation on your keyboard . or click on your selection and then select from playlist from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files . this simple thing is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , just next to the add @-@ button , is to save the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably you have missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for li@@ b@@ ach , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore , we support the actual question which media types has to support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / O / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so quite every single audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even use text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default no MP3 de@@ coder are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input @-@ key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playing MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the sc@@ ru@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix @-@ mix for Al@@ sa ( eg SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix -@@ mix for Al@@ sa . &quot;
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem and help a solution . for ge@@ ting you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ use ) .
&quot; this is doing &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . you don &apos;t forget that media need to listen to Al@@ sa . you can hear a MP3 not simply to Al@@ sa , you would be able to listen to Al@@ sa . G@@ Stre@@ amer read the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend direct to Al@@ sa , just as well as x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time majority ) and increase the size of the sound @-@ bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause r@@ ör@@ te playback . read this error report . enlarge The Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to obtain the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ than &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use any other drivers ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the d@@ ots . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; please try this ( finish your Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download your m@@ peg files , compile and install it . then you will find the module folder with G@@ ST config / g@@ stre@@ amer ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . &quot;
please tell about it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes please send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike classic field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . moreover the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP is that already possible . place in your calendar program an alarm and let you perform with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; let you start playing . ensure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have stopped by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how can I find out the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is available .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is open in an independent , in size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + Rights mouse button is a piece in the client succession in the queue . by pressing the input key after a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the Player window and the playlist have dra@@ ined functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the Control Panel ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear a lot of error messages . &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; place the CD , then click on a file browser with multiple folders . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . you can switch to the folder folder in a Con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the total result . &quot;
&quot; you can insert the rating for a piece by right by clicking on a sp@@ al@@ ten@@ ant in the play@@ lists window . here , select how all other attributes , namely , by right click on the piece and edit : review , select or edit click here . you can edit the rating also in the dialog met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not wish to release you when you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which is not assembled with the short term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok , which some users can also definitely find annoying . disable the option icon at the playing animated in the general settings . &quot;
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design .... &quot;
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too similar . to avoid difficulties it became removed .
&quot; Con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , while in the Con@@ quer@@ or browser . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select in the folding menu add Amar@@ ok . . &quot;

&quot; if you want to use Al@@ sa , please use the latest version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and therefore also caused a lot of fault reports . &quot;
presumably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does this output modules are not compiled . you have to re@@ configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
probably use a distribution which is installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ stre@@ amer is installed . you have to install the package g@@ stre@@ amer de@@ vel . after that you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re @-@ compile and install the package .
I get the mistake G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ek@@ . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ ying . a tip from Merlin TC : users do not compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS , when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer inst@@ ad installed . &quot;
&quot; to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , must be installed beside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then lead you as a system manager G@@ ST register . then you start Amar@@ ok new . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use Al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok set ... audio output type the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
&quot; p@@ c@@ m.@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type L@@ sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w &quot; h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug @-@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot;
&quot; enter in the furnishing dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the Ab@@ ta@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix device , disable the tick on Sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio @-@ output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may of course take this problem in your hand ! if you like , you can become the new so urgently needed assistant for Arts : ) &quot;

&quot; opens the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this allows you to create a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also create an image from a CD which then you can later burn later . also , there is also the possibility of bowling instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can create the DVD copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create an image of a DVD with the aid of copying dialogue . besides , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue , therefore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . thus you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; opens the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ ment@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; burns a previous CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ v or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which then immediately is not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burning a previously er@@ ated DVD @-@ picture . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
&quot; this dialog window can be converted . this dialog window is usually used after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well @-@ standing . it contains information about the illuminated video , code settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and to cut black margins . &quot;
displays information about the respective medium . this information is shown in the content view and include properties of the medium such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ ing &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small le@@ list is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not covered , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switching the folder view and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the medium or throw of the medium . &quot;
divi@@ des the content view one or out . the content view enables selecting and pulling of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs that is provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
&quot; divi@@ des the p@@ iste list in the project view , or out of . the p@@ allet list is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view open projects . the p@@ endant has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this will open a dialog window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands chosen in the upper part , you can customize the order order below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , the correct per@@ missions required to burning CDs and DVDs are needed . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system managers at the start of the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can work with general settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ th@@ eb . this dialog is designed to person@@ alize and to the subtle of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface with the help of this interface parts of functionality can be controlled by a sh@@ ell@@ scription .
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use features , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ alities , therefore , is more of your taste and the nature of your tasks is crucial , which of the included programs give you input . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use features , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will be started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ COP interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch of this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the up @-@ in K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read audio for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can be saved completely audio CD ; s posted , and be stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder which is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( to read / CD files ) in W@@ AV files , and by many enco@@ ders , who will be enco@@ ding these W@@ AV files . currently , l@@ ame for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss free compression ) can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . further co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ert into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as losses @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; i@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step there must be l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre @-@ up ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ erer . however , all these programs are usually installed for any Linux @-@ distribution . however , only the codi@@ le packages have to be installed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format should be used ? the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of co@@ aster , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word on copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; i@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not provided with a protected audio CD . if not the mechanisms of copying protection . do not avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while inser@@ tion has to be done so often ( the setup dialog has to be called so often called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily approach to reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand for the slim approach of the user interface , about which you will often stum@@ ble on the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can change in many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB on the internet or can work completely without a network , everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands from the main window . on the page step by step , there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; if the CD@@ DB request the CD@@ DB request of the CD data , according to the establishment of request at the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection must be made to the Internet . ) &quot;
start the reading and - if an en@@ coder has been configured in the controller &apos;s tab for code settings - the code .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that selecting a different Encoder than the standard can be read . it is to be noted that previously the Encoder has been configured in the controller at the tab .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a already put file is selected for co@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read , and to co@@ vert . &quot;
opens the furniture dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; ended ) . &quot;
opens the main entry dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different mapping cards ( such as Encoder to establish the duck ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under audio formats , MP3 and O@@ GG lose the most common . O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided with the most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard of a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG shelves is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = These setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = These setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . need always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ y for music of young , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that entered manually or through the program automatically from the free@@ DB is available via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed with &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code name to create the folder and file name , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of programs for the code of code and these parameters . the manual or the help of the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programmes . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) If MP@@ 3@@ s are added with l@@ ame ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are added with l@@ ame ; the result will be added : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the assistants ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is to be noted that here are only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there can be no more or less worth@@ less , so the artist can be added by a &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so the artist can be damaged by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the email address is used as the one in the system ( send an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address used by the server is not used ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is designed to use free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphi@@ cally closest to the next mirror server will be needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit with fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mir@@ rors for the online call of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which ex@@ les@@ see is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files to save on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely in source ... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first before it is not yet done .
&quot; for storing W@@ AV files , the codi@@ fier and hence the desired file format is selected . the first opening entries can be added to the enco@@ ders ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of free compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
the codi@@ fier package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the co@@ aster can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co @-@ operation . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a code , further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a window window ( eg ; console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &quot; must be replaced by the name of the installed body . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the equipment of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the spelling and read@@ er@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are trying to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a cop@@ ier audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual , all understood but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set everything up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
&quot; it must be found c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . any suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of you ( eg ; by trying to copy with the Con@@ quer@@ or something to copy ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something which probably is done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any read &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine to use the enco@@ ding machine ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) , where the files are stored and which structure is used . as we are lazy , we split the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will not most likely be reading a &amp; CD , if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is given to the readable program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the actual device drawing . if this is not working or if any more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , so helps a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries for the &amp; CD ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the Kar@@ tei@@ card General settings . here , there &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will leave as bel@@ low as shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select so that you will be informed when information is sent to the keywords of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the Kar@@ tei@@ Card CD ; -@@ settings . just choose both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically passes over the Internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry is instantly associated with the database entry and the file names / file names or day entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame will be easily changed . the directory or file name can be easily changed . the directory or file name can be easily changed . the directory or file name with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , if you want to enter everything manually . however , this is worth using free@@ DB locally . however , this is worth using free@@ DB locally . however , this is worth using free@@ DB , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following mapping card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the request of the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD will be ? read the section about free@@ DB . set everything like it is depicted in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equal to the server as though many fire@@ walls appear to boot the server , there may be more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to send a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first cross @-@ cross box should suff@@ ice .
simply take over the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make them sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; number simultaneously reading pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; to read the last piece : pass this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you cross this cross , then the path / folder can be stored in which the W@@ AV files can be stored . this can not be useful , if you want to make use of the files in the private folder . do not forget the folder if you want to do something using the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything to enter as it is in the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be made to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot : some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneous W@@ AV files at the same time : when a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried , more than a W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic setting of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; use . if you chose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll create MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is described , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data is described by the free@@ DB . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screen photos will be missing a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually will be manually retri@@ eved from the Internet . please refer to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done so now the &amp; CD ; in the drive , which was defined in the main window , turned on top . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on fundamental settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : when the &amp; CD was done successfully by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t selected the cross box for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD Editor - entry of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Re@@ ference title &apos; to &apos; the rest of the data in the text@@ field &apos; album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the &quot; &quot; Lat@@ est title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ aphr@@ ell per piece the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB the CD Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words are available with major letters or not ... ) but also to check if there is any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , at least for the artist , album and title of a piece . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information from the files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ zer to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the named CD ; agreement . in this example this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; information anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edi@@ tors appears again and you can see that the fields for the album already filled with the data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . the title of the piece applies to any case and other information that you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way until you entered all the title data on &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece @-@ list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . simply make sure that all the pieces are selected , or set the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button select , this window appears to be confirmation . OK , then this window appears to be confirmation . then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom section of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ zer that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not successfully been co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . if you have checked whether you write to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece of , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the code of piece 1 into the format MP3 . that means reading and running parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration setting found to squee@@ ze this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is unclear . the amount used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to be a problem with a AM@@ D@@ 64 game . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ aster of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you know with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous package . however , most distri@@ butions are already included in your distribution package . most distri@@ butions are already included in your distribution package . if you read this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance as the program your needs can be adjusted once , then the following is right for you : &quot;
one program calls for many different types of programs . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows the screen photos of the various mapping cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which may not be used in the example .
&quot; hello , still going on ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first Star@@ ted of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program boot no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version to add or modify , may it do . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if it has succeeded to catch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ ok@@ esp@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he did not have some properties with real @-@ time gra@@ fi@@ k and kar@@ a@@ oke liz@@ ards .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on all systems with OS@@ S - and &amp; k@@ de ; it builds on all systems with OS@@ S - and &amp; k@@ de ; e@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequence . Al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequence .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid , displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through the high@@ lighting of the de@@ pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can get in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to K@@ Mid can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lawn events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically identifies the procedure used .
&quot; seat support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; finish the play of a song , starts at the next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can choose to select ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the song you want . &quot;
&quot; you can also drop a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid , window . this also works with several songs at the same time . &quot;
&quot; to record a piece of music , open it and carry out the button to play in tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or run the blank bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid , window . ( with multiple pieces , they are added to a collection and then re @-@ played each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button , and drive away from the controller to and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song gets too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the blank bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the blank bar or selecting the menu entry will be inter@@ play in the menu piece , so the playback . put the space @-@ key while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ ly@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use visual texts and others both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up which events are to be displayed and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ity type is automatically selected , so you have nothing to adjust the entry to the automatic text box . however , you still have the possibility to change this , if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an E@@ ign@@ ite type , select from the menu settings the entries of text files or loung@@ ers . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are set up in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to attach a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the ge@@ ars in the collection manager . &quot;
into the temporary collection all the songs you want to not want to add any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not saved . worry about if you add many pieces .
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can choose the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be added to the opening ( using file opening or drag and drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add @-@ up to the collection is not enabled , in the opening of a piece , the temporary collection is activated and cap@@ tures . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs get off . if you select the series after the menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be specified . &quot;
&quot; to record a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list about the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button next song from the menu or press the button to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry piece from the menu or press the button to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and click on the button Dele@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events translated in events that understands the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus getting a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you just have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are compatible ( incl@@ . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary requirements for the playing of a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that each occurrence is a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of an interface is reached .
&quot; please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , as the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ als is ignored . it is assumed that the GM are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and no line for any of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds , which need this instrument to put on the tone with number M . if your key@@ board is not supporting a gun ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . this is what you wear in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; if so now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes 100 ( the drum to your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of patch is meant , with which each sound represents another Persian instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the sound height of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to give up sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of the lines is very important , just as their availability . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used above all to form sounds on the Persian @-@ channel channel . look at yourself as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to switch some channels to others . for example , if you want to switch the first and second channel , make this quite simply in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered between 0 and 15 , built according to the following patterns : &quot;
n is the channel which is used on the Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option the key@@ map is used to change the patch on this channel ! if you use the key@@ map option which will change the patch on this channel . in this case always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ c@@ ab patch on the per@@ k@@ lift channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o will be multip@@ ly in which ratio of the Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event sends to the value of n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file is not dec@@ imal number ) . &quot;
&quot; this option is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch higher . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave . unfortunately , try to try to taste the right value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole row pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos see which sounds just played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view also to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t have more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view in the menu settings below the point of channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so you can change the pace of a song . so , if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it includes the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone else &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file requires about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have this happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source of distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agreed to support &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; beforehand , activate the setting automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default speed you can click on the LCD double .
&quot; I &apos;ve been open on a &amp; box ; in this way , I must change when the collection is played at the end or I &apos;d like to play a file , only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen quickly a file without it immediately to add them directly to a collection , turn the setting up automation adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection , added to opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. only first do you want to play the first file . so make your temporary collection the temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me , further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; I wrote a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I am trying to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect a bit of time . when hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files collect , music and propositions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really want to send me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you send me a MIDI file , you should get in touch with me , as I may already have the file already . &quot;
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get money in my spare time . I therefore want to stress that I can only read more about it because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Re@@ duction of the error that the key at A@@ we @-@ cards was too high .

&quot; and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; additionally there can be found &amp; k@@ mid . on the homepage you can follow the development , looking for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you have a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you cannot hear any music . &quot;

for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window , which is only displayed when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to rec@@ tify the preferred connections under the menu book@@ lets , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one another , you should use the category of continuous playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ ical estu@@ ary . if you click an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ pped entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configurations . of course you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not going through an editor , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ pping , but by using a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , it has to be chosen from the menu in the same way with playlist and either the processing mode , or another category chosen . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost when the processing mode left or another group is selected , without the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched through changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation when Star@@ ted and Be@@ ing can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ able and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml / share / or / m@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation when Star@@ ted does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , the user can end the application for a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be ads : / / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f : / / / / / home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f : &quot; &quot; in@@ kling &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here the path can be adjusted from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the network and other things .
another tool for fault is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the edition of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able , here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos;@@ can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can play , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the m@@ ime type , / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnishings file of K@@ DE are specified . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application , and after error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that there is always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course , only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be re @-@ giving : &quot;
&quot; can be configured by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player - &gt; X@@ video port to use . there should be recognized ports to be selected by which one is selected . the correct co@@ ding must be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has included an DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video can also function ( 0.@@ 0 ) . this is also intended to operate the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server . this is also necessary for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server therefore in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) that must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphic user surfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . using Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be attributed to the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included for the installation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . this allows an easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be considered . however , the support for this project or documentation is desired , should be made contact via the ki@@ le ; website . &quot;
&quot; contact questions or when comp@@ iling from &amp; ki@@ le ; on or , extensions should be desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list of ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; it &apos;s an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; setting up for the &amp; l@@ atex ; environment in a graphical surface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; features of an easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his ways to learn to learn the manual for K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
&quot; for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is difficult to operate , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but realistic terrestrial is that it comes from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here only a good to be able to see &amp; l@@ atex ; given it is not the ultimate book for this . to be able to master , B. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ . &quot;
&quot; just as other identification languages includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text class , starts with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ &apos; \ &apos; { document } . &quot;
&quot; the rapid entry of &amp; ki@@ le , is a common feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; . the selection of the wizard offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be performed some on the document settings . &quot;
&quot; document@@ aries , document &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; cartoon &#93; , Review ( DIN ) &#91; cartoon &#93; , documentary &#91; research &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom . &quot;
enco@@ ding : with this the character co@@ ding is set . modern systems use increasingly the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . best should UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x ( to correct processing of the &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; . for the integration they merely will be made in the cross field .
&quot; articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the document@@ aries from Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users now do not worry about it . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information to be given in the section .
&quot; - As other source code ( example ) : if you see some more subtle areas of text , settings and elements ( as well as other source code ) , it is likely to be understood by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless . however , it will save you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , you can save you through the high@@ lighting time and . &quot;
&quot; with automatic transmission of the environments , by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for example \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu . setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part of it is the most common , most subtle element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , individual elements can be changed and viewed through a single mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer to the respective line in &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the form@@ ated document and also other information such as the font , and also other information such as the font , and is beside PDF the available output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print DV@@ I ; files for different systems and upri@@ ghts . &quot;
&quot; in use of the DV@@ I ; -@@ file with the editor , the exact opposite is closed . once on a section in the DV@@ I ; -@@ source text , the respective opposite is cool@@ ed . once in a section in the DV@@ I ; source text , it becomes the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ spect@@ ator . &quot;
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a Master document will simplify work with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project can be adjusted a project @-@ wide master document on project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless any errors in the source code are available ) .
&quot; filing file : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file on stock exchange , and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ top@@ us ; after the quick installation . &quot;
&quot; in view of the Edit tool@@ bar , the three gro@@ wers of the selection are presented in the document . the selection fields have been designed for the quick assessment of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ able &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box other is available for inser@@ ting articles such as tags , mer@@ gers notes or references . the available opportunities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name is created for a section , an image or other element . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a fixed name ( select a selection box ) .
&quot; when using quote , a list of literature is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this is only if the file has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author offers good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files , the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand it is written . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¢ teau , is used for setting the font of the font . it can be the following ty@@ pe@@ gs available to the main issues : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices for setting up : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document , and determined by the settings . 2 . the document can be written from reason to hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ model class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the font . the fonts will not be fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code was entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text is compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the menu or the button &apos;s quick recovery . &quot;
&quot; the source code must be stored in front of the compact . &amp; ki@@ le , the storage is automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be sought after the errors in the protocol . when using quick @-@ production should be started &amp; oc@@ re ; this is not the case , the log should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ { environment } . &quot;
the benefits are merely within the surroundings ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ \ { environment } ) . there are no marking ( number ) for the influ@@ encing within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to enable lifting the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be added for example , certain fonts , cur@@ sive pressure , under@@ lining , etc . , either with the command \ \ \ &apos; s or automatically at the end of the area . &quot;
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ ative pressure and is as long as it is closed until he is closed with a \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } cur@@ sively .
\ \ quote : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { rate } and ends with \ \ \ \ &apos; rate } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; expression language was represented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit of text entered a bit of text , a few adap@@ tations should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this reason , there should be a quotation , a few places in the fat and spa printing and a poem for the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , you can get back to the editor using editor view or Str@@ g E again ( in internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the windows must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and get some fun . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a common file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ apro@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF files or computer screen . &quot;
for the print of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - can then print the document via file printing ( if the printer is set properly ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file is created from the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text , the conversion can begin by means of the kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
looking for the pre @-@ looking search for the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ ed files . this only needs to set up modern under settings Ki@@ le ... tools can be made .
&quot; to carry out for the pre @-@ looking search , the mouse cursor is positioned in a line of the source tex@@ tes and slept on pre @-@ search search . the jump to the corresponding point in DV@@ I ; viewers are then carried out . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; necessary and to the corresponding line j@@ umped ; in &amp; oc@@ top@@ ; as text box ( settings Ok@@ ay setup ... editor )
&quot; should , when using fast @-@ construction of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers do not exist , there may be a bug . if there is an error , this will appear in the log file or in the window window in summary . &quot;
the log file limits the error source in the source text . the log file is always the line where the error messages can be used . to view the faul@@ ty line in which the error messages must be printed and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the error @-@ proof line .
&quot; as soon as in the appropriate button in tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from using the template for the document . these features include : &quot;
&quot; for a selection of le@@ eres document , a document can be used either from scratch or used for the fast creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; hedge users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; can create a new template by means of running an existing document and selecting a file template document . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a file using file new , some string can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character co@@ ding ) . these variables may set up a number of strings in settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ TI@@ ONS $ : this string is replaced by entering documentation . typically they are used : \ \ model class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated commands of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps will be accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , you can then have its own template instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . is a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described under the steps described above . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used by many different types of text ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for reading &amp; ch@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his mills should be found to learn the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le , can start there directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be viewed in &amp; l@@ atex ; you can find a suitable description virtually all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syn@@ tax . &quot;
a double @-@ clicking with penetr@@ ated Str@@ g button to extend the &amp; tex ; word that is in this way to click \ \ par of \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ par .
&quot; when pulling the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
when using the arrow ta@@ sten with penetr@@ ated re@@ plac@@ ements can become parts of the source text in the editing window .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source texts and this note . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add to an own type of book@@ case inside the text . this is also an own type of book@@ marking within the text . thereby , this ank@@ le is highlighted , so that they will automatically enter the first entering of a sign . &quot;
&quot; the Edit is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; important functions for their selection . under editing extracts , the following commands may contain the text selection : &quot;
&quot; in this extended significance consists of a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph , there is not a text containing single lines ( as in other text enco@@ actors ) . this advanced meaning is not a text containing two @-@ day lines , and all other lines of the source code . the only bo@@ iling thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore that the paragrap@@ hs are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; find the word under the current Cur@@ sor@@ position . this selection also has more advanced meaning , because this command also includes &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with a crack ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for walking distance to a part of the document , the keyboard is removed . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the keyboard with its own commands , the following commands may include the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the Edit paragraph .
it has already been indicated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; to play . therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF additional commands under Edit surroundings for a nice simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
this command will cover the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the edge of the surroundings .
this command will cover the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the surroundings .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or within the command \ \ &apos; Beg@@ in { environment } , the end of the environment is embro@@ i@@ dered ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many mer@@ ging ambient commands , this command slept quickly , the most popular environment , so that the swal@@ lowed environment structure is not covered . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Edi@@ Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from Edit environment .
this command will cover the current group at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the impressive cl@@ amps .
with this command the end of the current group le@@ aps ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the sm@@ iled cross@@ roads placed .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the sli@@ pped cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # located , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many wel@@ ded groups brack@@ ets can quickly go away . this command slept , the most popular group , so that the swal@@ lowed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the purpose of suitable implementation is used in &amp; l@@ atex . for the purpose of suitable implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple an@@ alogy is used . also , the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple an@@ alogy is used . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double room can set up using settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be installed .
&quot; it can also be used by lay@@ outs ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and thus German or fran@@ chis@@ or , they are also a lot more languages available . &quot;
&quot; when entering Shift ; input key is available &amp; ki@@ le ; a smart show change . if the current position within a list of lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , for example , en@@ um@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ; not only a pointer change but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a tables environment , I slept &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an interfer@@ ing break down . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ defined &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this can be found under settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X is added .
&quot; some users need to arrange the columns in tables environments , and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ) . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate has already added a good source text processing , these are available in &amp; ki@@ le ; to set up special commands ( mostly for free &amp; l@@ atex ; ) all these modes can be set aside . all these modes can be set aside ... all these modes may be set aside . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , a new environment by means of the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } is becoming &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically the command \ \ \ \ { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) added . &quot;
&quot; the last letter of the input is removed , the last character of the input is removed , and there is also the most common list . on the other hand , the list can also be decreased through the input of another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , the descriptions are easily removed from &amp; ki@@ le ; also jumping marks , so that a simple jump to these positions via Edit ski stamps , can be fitted and the desired parameters then can be found . &quot;
&quot; under settings , set up ; establish ... ki@@ le , different wound lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands , as well as wonders of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not available in accordance with environment . it has always been used a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the calling of the complete mode will be used . on the other hand , the environments are used as often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for understanding between the environments that poses . &quot;
&quot; in the calling of the complete environment , the command to the edge of the environment is automatically in@@ activated and it appears \ \ &apos; Beg@@ in { . afterwards , the environment can be continued on the easiest way and can be termin@@ ated by dr@@ aped the entry bar . &quot;
&quot; once this has been accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le , recognizes that it is a list of lists , even a first \ \ item command with one . &quot;
&quot; under settings , set up ; establish ... ki@@ le ; con@@ currently , settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the bed@@ time frame of the complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of shelves which can be replaced immediately by lay@@ ering string . as an example of a shelf list the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl is used in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word conve@@ yed tr@@ l + Alt spaces , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large , more wonderful times are not helpful for the automatic perf@@ ecting . however , it has been found that many more popular in a document has been written more than once . thus , offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the complete suspension for all already written sounds . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the body settings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ ful@@ fills be shiel@@ ded . here , the sle@@ ell@@ ar value can also be specified here . &quot;
&quot; the completed files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ le / share / dres@@ ser / dres@@ ser / dres@@ ser / mode / dres@@ ser / mode / mode installed . mode stands for ir@@ ation ( subscription ) , Dic@@ tionary ( w@@ allet ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics form the entry of graphics as simple as possible . to ensure the clear view of the bases on the graphics format , the sections should be considered and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the common interest and new orders of pages . the PDF output is used , so the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools are arranged new and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to choose the outcome of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the men@@ ades , create converting , and create a view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers such as &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or further conversion can be used the keyboard ; 2 ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file into a PS file and be viewed by old ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command rapid battery , normally an viewer is called after the comp@@ iling . if no integrated viewer should be used , every time a new window will happen . &quot;
a new project is presented to the project new project .... here are the following information for the project :
&quot; when using the file name , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
&quot; the script function of &amp; ki@@ le , permits the order of EC@@ MA@@ Script Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the vertical layout . &quot;
&quot; the API scripts have not been developed yet , and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le . &quot;
first to be said that the export environment of scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&quot; l@@ atex ; is a quite common system , where the basic functions can be expanded through a variety of extra packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different assistance to support the user . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . included in this are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
&quot; it is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages ) but rather is a complete operating manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; and it is therefore ideal for looking for a certain form@@ atting . here , it is a very rough , this document , it becomes in &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which includes a database of all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphic top . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for parcel name or stroke . of &amp; ki@@ le ; only the results are shown .
a double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the operator the viewer for the document .

&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has worked , known as a pro@@ c , and how excessive it is . lift it up , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply the symbol for the XML processor , and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to do a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the ge@@ aring working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of present work folders and enter the folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when argued pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already worked , know how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; there is now a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they just leave the current working folder . if not , then they select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a copy on the screen , her file is faul@@ ty . please check the errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. , then they let current file already marked by ha@@ kt . if not , delete it from the current file , and select the file @-@ checking file via other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ being is , click the Well @-@ tailored check selection . &quot;

&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL , processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; already marks , then leave the current file simply chosen . if not , remove the selected file and select the file processing file using the other file file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is said to . the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ in , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. may have a lot to do . therefore , you can benefit from the additional functionality and have to do not wait until someone can use the haz@@ ard in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; therefore , the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements they find further down . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a box , we begin using the menu plugins . thus , the following dialog is open : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all the contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; they often work on a project multiple persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship each . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. supports the specification of team members , and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties to be configured . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leader and sub @-@ project leaders .
&quot; the user can look out from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who he is . this happens by sending the te@@ amm@@ ing member from the list and the button l@@ ends as expressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text . &quot;
the nickname and attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and remarks . see for further information .
&quot; besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event to provide information to the team leader , if something happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when some particular happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project so that a file is assured , or a script that file a file to the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , processed and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ sat can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such guides be set up . &quot;
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
notes is easy . it may choose either the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comment section followed by notable text .
&quot; remarks can be sent to a determin@@ ative member of the team . in this case , the nickname of the following nickname of the team leader ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader distributor sub@@ project leaders should be given the appropriate section or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roller names are independent of large or small , but blank spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and form@@ atting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ diagnostic and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are available via the settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over some pages that will be treated in succession .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; regarding tags including car complete can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / mini@@ ature of tags : large / small case of tags . normal Groß / petit is , the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / mini@@ ature of attributes : large / small case of attributes : normal Groß / Klein@@ scription means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if indicated , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after it . added . &quot;
un@@ optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
&quot; start @-@ up and finish @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the appropriate day is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic vom@@ iting of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into the corresponding code during inser@@ tion .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ e@@ types for detection of different types of files . using the default button can be recovered .
standard drawing co@@ ding : re@@ generated by newly created or in other way than file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however this setting is drawn from the same in the proj@@ ector properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is drawn from the same in the proj@@ ector properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; created regularly backup copies , so with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program this backup can be recovered . it is not the same as saving the file . even for yet not saved documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time , created . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be represented either in the editing area or a separate view ( or documentation in a mapping ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview , and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings at the default back next start is useful when the user &apos;s interface by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views went through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command @-@ line parameters .
the War@@ n@@ registr@@ ations area serves to control the control of the ability to switch the display of warnings by no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode . see the different modes .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree causes the following action , it is possible to change the possible action by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse @-@ sk@@ inn@@ ed action . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , can be adjusted at the editing of the tree , and how deep during a change in struc@@ turing the structure is automatically opened . empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are such , where no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area for the soli@@ ds of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it can give a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ le cap means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , most famous &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in need to be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not on a stand@@ alone like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode download : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the charging . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. , whether the given information is correct . select , if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; starting from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting has been re @-@ developed , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Debug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations to plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , which adds support to the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in box you can change the specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitoring variables is displayed . appears usually in the left dock .
&quot; one view , in which all semi @-@ points , with pointer numbers and conditions are listed . appears normally in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin with , in case required , or she shares the plug @-@ in , if a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it should not be respected to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or end the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to initiate a debit requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the view de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , starting with the execution of the scripts , and currently running on the line . if this happens while the script is made , the execution will proceed . if this happens before a debit request has been started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the scripts , without information about monitoring variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is given , the execution starts . if a statement has been given , the execution begins once a requirement is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script without entering the functions or falls .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next statement in the script , whereby whenever possible in functions and includes flaw@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next , as if there were no recent ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , the over@@ a@@ woke value appears in the variation view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

&quot; this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron can adapt to your needs , and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron can help you get better . &quot;
&quot; insert &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ esh ; used to provide support for market and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS ; to give support for market and scripts . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are included in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and family 2 ; s are made of two parts , the script and tool@@ p . day folder , are made up of two parts , the day folder and tool@@ p . day folder include hand @-@ oriented , the text and instructions faster to a document than a user could ever do . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in favour of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create equ@@ XML files , then the &amp; mas@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the peculiarities , the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool make a quick installation of tags in a document without danger of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are nothing but folder . they only contain the &amp; mas@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the equ@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and borders will be described in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document , but it can contain the definition of many tags but contains only nothing else than anything else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it is used ; att@@ r &gt; an argument to function . ( only family 2 )
only for the tag@@ ty@@ p class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a triple @-@ attribute group and the attributes within this day can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; text ; text &gt; -@@ day determined . this is a single @-@ element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can occur only once for any attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains additional tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single @-@ element type element .
is the source used source for the attributes in the day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; it is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting edge and a methodology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method can be empty or % call % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container day which divi@@ des the elements of a list . it can only occur for a attribute description . it is a single element type element .
&quot; sets the position of the attribute , one tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( for example , for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty . &quot;
&quot; gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day , for example , should be present in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; Labels &gt; Day ) . this item is empty . &quot;
gives a list of elements that may occur within the following tags . this element is a single element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with a &amp; XML ; conclusions : ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; s . ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; text &gt; &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced . this will not fail a leg change , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the equ@@ XML files , the tools to start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement ; -@@ window to start and over@@ see tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow the simple instructions to follow . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available yet . at present , the review is carried out only at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes this &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; version Y@@ PE @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &gt; &quot; &quot; version &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; class &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; mas@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is one editor for it , accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D ; this can be processed by a list of selected &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; bridge p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; it should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agram ; / / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can set up actions with settings ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialogue :
&quot; this action suggests keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the button , the Custom button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut . &quot;
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the det@@ ects settings and when carrying out the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications can be started ( or parts of the document ) , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified pa@@ edi@@ ts are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting / share / share / share / share / paste / share / paste / scripts / scripts / scripts / scrip@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / debit / scripts / scripts in its path : $ path There are other special Vari@@ able ones that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the name name will be removed .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number ; this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script inputs from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron can take up the default entry . in the selection field input can be determined what to send to the standard entries . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the led application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : regular issue , directed to the default output . it can be stated , resulting in the default output written text , by the value the selection box will be set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
&quot; fill in all the necessary fields , and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag attributes has and you plan to use their usage , enable you to edit &quot; &quot; Edit Day &quot; &quot; when available so that a input when using the promotion is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; in view of the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user to be sign@@ aled , that An@@ click this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; step in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press him . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the apply button and continue them with other tags , so it still exists or confirm with OK to finish . &quot;
suppose you want to supplement some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to tool@@ bar or it should adjust this to better overview by some tr@@ ams in several groups . open tool@@ ing dialog via settings tool . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to choose the tr@@ enner ( to the left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to add to tool@@ bar , push the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
for example I want to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will choose it and add to tool@@ bar .
&quot; please note , as the den@@ omin@@ ator support the group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar has to be tested by pro@@ filing of all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; secure in the correct folder . after re @-@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; Sco@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( n ) , if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language , or the form@@ atting language , which you like to like . therefore , describes this chapter , as I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; -@@ repository whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc thee = Path , relatively to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Section 2 = # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html . &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level of contents = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ .@@ basic synchron@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is the sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess sti@@ ff ( except due to reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the contents of the table are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent on the top of the Bau@@ man@@ vision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; resources to be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for the design of the context @-@ sensitive assistance . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H code for context would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connecting lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of by Be@@ ist@@ rich separated context elements that shall be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / share / share / share / share / share / share / share / share / share / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth it , you will send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation used to be used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ians ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ians ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ians ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ians ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ians ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ians ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. you are not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners , or else to whom . at various places there will be an email with email to send tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. -@@ users can download it . to make use of the resources , what an GP@@ G / P@@ GP key needs to be signed . thus , the source of resources will be assured , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys you may have a look . in dialogue new resource , the input fields must remain empty ( URL to stay empty ) and with clicking on OK , the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , nor before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature . if the integrity given and the resource is correct signed , a message appears with the specification of the owner of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format will be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by the D@@ T@@ D shop and Conver@@ ting a D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition : the string that is in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag as HTML Public / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .d@@ t@@ d should appear
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; after the conversion of the new &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; this chapter is trying to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; little benefit to them . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is the work area divided into three areas : global , local and proj@@ ector . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. , available . from tool@@ ing about actions is everything that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; this enables the group to secure the different tool , actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder @-@ tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the building views , the car@@ makers with information and the tool . please suggest you in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the sc@@ rolling with the right mouse button to remove a context menu with the current document password , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right menu on the editing section lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / paste / paste ) , edit the word under the mouse cursor ( cutting / paste / paste ) , for the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file , when the string are under the mouse cursor file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor &apos;s tool@@ bar , the tool@@ factor is shown . at present , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard is shown , for which a set of tool@@ ing is shown . in the course of the further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron , the tool will be adapted to the new functions and associated users needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ ing is really easy . if they want to insert the day ; for example , click the icon which represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this straight day . now , you can insert the data for this straight day . if they want to insert several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ age@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. to navigate , to open and wander . in the presentation with kar@@ tei@@ es are available for files , project , sample structure , scripts , attributes , attributes , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. prepared . this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as add , removal , up@@ loading or delete files from storage medium with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be classified in three categories , depending on how they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the category depends on the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more on templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information on a script . above the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of an element , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element it will open a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among other construction views . with it can change some quickly attributes and nam@@ y@@ ments , which allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here you can find the full documentation of web technology for your development ; it can create pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement ; it can be edited and viewed by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and looked at . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; two car@@ dinal @-@ star at the bottom of the window , can be achieved via the user information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this mapping shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . for example the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
&quot; this mapping shows all errors in Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so what is ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; tool@@ ing are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the option to define own commands , as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed @-@ archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can get them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. as any other secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable when you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril ; to get a number of options that can be handed to the configure script . to have a complete list of all options to give . / configure --@@ help you . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path before her bin . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. was optimised for a rapid web development and combines a well @-@ mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now , this would make him an independent web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; one is restricted : when you can define it in &amp; XML ; define , then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; therefore , be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is based in good application of free software , the idea of why , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; smells not only this is possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; to extend as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. allows web developers the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) allows the automation of an intuitive and powerful Multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool . &quot;
&amp; P@@ anta ; Plus is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a quick web development and quickly became an advanced editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; P@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more details about the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or c@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta execute ) . &quot;

&quot; a quick access to files from files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and all files as templates for later use . if you are trying to store the selected file / text outside of the local / project template , only a bug is reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts in inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; thum@@ b so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting assignment .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; check which the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
&quot; turns the block selection respectively . this allows you to select text flas@@ hes with the help of the &amp; Shift key , key . &quot;
go directly to a pointer number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of scrip@@ tions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; education and switching of troubles@@ hooting at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; the problem @-@ re@@ porter is enabled , as soon as you change the structure tree . &quot;
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one mouse click .
&quot; when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other recorded documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ adi ; projects are stored with the file us .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files , which could be there . this enables , e.g. graphics files in your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ adi ; projects can be explained the details . &quot;
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar , which creates only the name . actions must be added to the name actions ... to be added to tool actions or you will be asked if you want to save the tool . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not del@@ ve them from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message using tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
allows the up@@ loading of tool to the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
&quot; download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D , which has made you or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement , own description format . &quot;
&quot; loading / refresh of the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; is useful , if the endo@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew . if this global is and a writing to the global K@@ DE folder is not available , fail the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is available , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setting dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; enabled and de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this is only associated with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is refused to deny the inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar when this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu points listed below . click to be activated . click on a activated plug @-@ in plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the syn@@ tax @-@ fixing mode for the current file . the list of available heart schem@@ ata depends on the der@@ ate ; version .
&quot; select the type of pointer identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
&quot; checks the syn@@ tax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D , using the external application . &quot;
&quot; instant switch between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching switch can sometimes need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the default mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; 3.2 and earlier corresponds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains for each open sub @-@ window an entry . with selection of a train the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; notes the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron , the main window at or off . &quot;
&quot; the changes in this dialog influences every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; Web@@ browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate you will find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should produce a help in accordance with the surroundings of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free @-@ licensed , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; to support the development in financial form , find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be completed with Shift , F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . the name of the name will automatically be filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; -@@ project file . by default , it has stored the name of the project in small letters and without space , with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access , one , except you will be processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host could be an adaptation needed . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ content , you have to download and change . if you want to use the script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be involved . if a project is started from scratch , non @-@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option all the files and folders are displayed within the main folder , and you can make a precise selection of your di@@ sil@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clas@@ hes out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings to simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with project properties in the menu or with the keyboard short@@ cut ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in described . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) which can be ignored by project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
&quot; supple@@ mental option to above , also files which are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded during opening the project . in more , more than projection views can be read . &quot;
&quot; with this , the required de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed can be supported in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin can be adjusted with the button options . in the de@@ bu@@ gger , the fault is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window profile , high @-@ load profiles can be adjusted ( see in ) , as well as the display of a modular view of the contents of the server for each profile , by pointing a separate building for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project configuration can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch action actions and add these actions to change , modify or delete these actions , modify or delete these actions , such as the Seven of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be influenced at the moment . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project construc@@ tors gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder behave equally , however , the entries are missing and opening with ... in the right button of the right mouse button : &quot;
here different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the place of high @-@ speed files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button moves to prevent the distance . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory , and will be forgotten by program@@ ing . this possibility is useful when the common up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password is not available on the record . &quot;
this will stop transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partement , many high @-@ type profiles can be created and thereby up@@ loaded to the project ( or parts of the project ) to various servers . in the editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ ing . it can give many views in a project , that is , by simple exchange of view , can be loaded to various files and tool@@ ing and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ tool project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ es are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; best to distinguish the menu tool . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set aside either by means of the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which leads to other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar can be executed , where the actions can be specified on this or other tool . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition , the entries are removed and edited action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ ing and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool ... and set up actions .. to set up actions ..
&quot; templates are used in essential document skel@@ eton , code cut@@ ters and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically such as a common file system with expanded organization and interfaces . templates have to copy , move or any on the system existing directory in the template . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ agram ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each submission conditions before using exactly .
&quot; binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ar . binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links under global templates . more information about the templates tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of this Templ@@ ates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple rum@@ or for the purpose is designed to be efficient . some examples can be found under global templates . see in more information on the templates tree . &quot;
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is intended to be inserted in the documents by a comment on a complete menu system based on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are to be found under global templates . see in more information about the templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a comp@@ ner@@ ed @-@ archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ril . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure to Beli@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . . ) and choose file As template save as a local template ... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project situation ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the full tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click on file as a template save as a local / project situation . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with dial and pick up the construction supervision . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can be copied only into a set @-@ up folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling , or inser@@ ts over the file tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; one can choose to right in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented way of way . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ prints , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; shaping , insert files or link to them . additionally , one can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects . &quot;
the pre @-@ set structure in the sub@@ window Templ@@ ates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / share / share / share / paste / share / templates / templates / paste / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / / / / templates / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; in order to set the behaviour of a folder is to click on the folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder , and select the menu properties tab . the following dialogue appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is di@@ pped , as soon as Eli@@ ter@@ ous attributes is conce@@ aled . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything out of the regular basis . if a stem folder would seem explicitly , unless they would be explicitly activated . if a normal folder would appear to be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , it would appear to be explicitly activated with something like text building . if nothing appears , one is probably in a stem folder . &quot;
allowed or revised text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p up by copying from contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ prints .
&quot; in addition , one can have a full command collection ( indicating right mouse button ) about a full command collection for adding folders or copy , and paste from a location to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the source text editor through the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second one shares the editor window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML , page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch back to source editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit a document that &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ code ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor ; there is no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor , this mode is already active , the key@@ word raises the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization unit is adjustable between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , and the source text editor . after selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in general , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is recommended : a small span@@ ne for fast computers and a large volume for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , you want to select the title of the website , so as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is used to change this document . thus , one can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document even for example head@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added to pressures on Internet search engines . a click on the list allows the modification of content , e.g. key words on the column name and keywords key@@ word key@@ word on the content column . &quot;
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the viewing of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules on the list as with the Met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is not currently supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style , by pressing the file @-@ opening button and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , through due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works like usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted through tap and deleted by means or removal button . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags will be in the same way over the tool@@ ing , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded with text , everyone needs to be removed an out@@ fit anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some tool render such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release you need to use the tables or lists tool@@ ing . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of styl@@ ish@@ ings . in contrast to other programs for style conditions the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be pro@@ secuted .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries are li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ ols , purple and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , in one place in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ d@@ b @-@ Com@@ pati@@ bility mode , you can set in a specified file and file number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g obtained the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without arrow file . file name in the same folder as the top charged file name with rel@@ ativ@@ em path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is available for example a sty@@ ling file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l . the following input is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or entire agreement is checked on a partial or whole agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNA@@ ME , which contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the stated &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended according to the rules , which is defined by the described in X@@ SL source : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a decent holder must be dissolved for the related UR@@ I and pointer number . this will be automatically re @-@ checked when loading of the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . half points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each passing .

&quot; the program used by me showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what changed right within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the rede@@ em@@ ulation had changed . this changes had been a small nightmare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs . later many more useful features were added .
&quot; if you want to compare quickly text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function made a lot of work , was the same and merged of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ defined file browser . &quot;
&quot; also , 3 @-@ ways comp@@ osing is fully supported . this is useful if two people are working independently of a piece of co@@ de and displays changes . in this editor , you can edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can manage the result directly . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also in the same and merged folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and also for the possibilities of current color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can view a look at the summary in the column at the left side of the column . ( no more trouble when somebody is changing . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , then the color shows that the file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ p@@ par@@ work easier by using only the file name from the first file . example : &quot;
1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder 3 @-@ o target folder
&quot; opening @-@ dialog allows the manual command of file name , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the list . opening dialog you will not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , then use the identical or composite of folders . if you choose a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; when combined together , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to determine immediately a output file . you can also get this step later when saving . &quot;
the inser@@ tion button will open a dialogue with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
you can also use pulling and insert : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall via a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes , it would like to create several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively great deal . they would have to load only two appropriate files , and then compare and compare them . now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply to copy , then compare . &quot;
note : currently there is nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the case of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program than cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains a different color . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every@@ de info line has a different color . ( if the path is to a file for too long , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source boxes are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ settings can be changed over the settings menu ) . &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one sees the color that file differs . when both files differ , the color scheme is different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merged ) . &quot;
&quot; links besides the text is displayed . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . when white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white signs are only visible in strings and comments , relevant for pre @-@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the merger column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the particular source file has no lines . if the pointer is enabled , the line will be shown on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison window ) also has a info line with the in@@ scription issue : , the file name and &#91; change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons , to next sol@@ dering / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ es are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group &apos;s line in all windows is marked and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this is also a jump of the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color back@@ color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by the automatic conversion or through manual editing , no further line will remain in the group ; then there is only a place for the case that you change your opinion and perhaps again select another source . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might have to copy and paste it elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , however , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used to run the mouse , but you can use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , side , tr@@ l @-@ start and str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w , as you can also use it from other programs , Si@@ w , as well as from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the eyeb@@ row window , you can also use the other buttons to Edit . using the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between impressions and over@@ copy mode . ( set the entry mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns , the view of all windows is syn@@ ced at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section and explained the edi@@ table window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , for the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must be distinguished between sol@@ dering and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the option to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button to the cli@@ p@@ board button . if this is enabled , you must automatically copy the Copy button . be careful with this option , as you could check the content of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally . &quot;
&quot; pointer versions are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a pointer symbol \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use vehicle @-@ like character file , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; neither does not use Bin@@ ding files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files is stored automatically while the next start is restored and when you start the next start . ( select menu &gt; &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialogue also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are shown in short document . if the chosen Scripture does not support this representation , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors might be a few colours not available in its pure form , but would be shown to be presented . at these systems the button preferences automatically represents an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the appropriate number of spaces are inserted in the box . otherwise a tablet character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press or return Return , the first line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy in the cli@@ p@@ board fall then . &quot;
you can select which character type you prefer to save . the pre@@ determined value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
&quot; when the same files are tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical rows can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white signs may not be ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored . also , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some Edi@@ tors ( on some systems ) store a car @-@ back &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; and &apos; one character &apos; &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then they might store files with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , but then they may be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , but then they may be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , but then this option must be disabled . during the default , this option must be disabled . in the default , this is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis figures and relative signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are nonetheless displayed , but they will be treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences , the option is activated in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atic transfer mode , this attitude determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white signs using the selected file as a source . if you need this only from time to time , you can better use the functions voters A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also involves conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter to scanning folders and manage a compilation . look for details under documentation for the list @-@ comparison and arran@@ ging .
&quot; when a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version is displayed the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if you already exist such a b@@ aking file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
it fits the language of the user interface . you don &apos;t have to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart this option to change the change . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up there globally via the Control Center . )
the following co@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option for all entries the upper setting is used .
over the selection fields for code appears a brief note that is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
&quot; adjust the code enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpre@@ tations . since the code is individually adjustable , even files with different co@@ ding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have processed a file , you can specify which code to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing instructions , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files could handle 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
turn this to sup@@ press from changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color@@ fully over@@ covered column . however , sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; C is displayed next to a second over@@ si@@ eve column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . let &apos;s just use the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
type the comparison window with one another or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide if you compare the files together . a simple click starts the compilation and uses the file name of the last source file as a pre @-@ defined name for the output file . if this function is used to restart it , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be given first to the external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences which corresponds exactly your requirements . for example , you can cut this function for example , or to correct the re@@ tention . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is displayed first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is given . the output of the command is used only in line . you can write your own Pre@@ processor , which is exactly your requirements . each entry line must have an associated output row . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting the di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program is needed , and most users want that not programming yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed , or per@@ l is completely enough . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to change in large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ ( . * \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This is therefore all characters in a row . \ \ 1 in the set @-@ up string refers to the found text in the first Klam@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . \ \ U conver@@ ts the text in big letters around .
CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically created text files . * \ \ \ _ BAR _ _ _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experimenting , you may start to understand it and maybe you like these regul@@ ars even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several options at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ on &apos; ; &apos; used to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ p -@@ e . \ \ ( and \ \ ) require per@@ l only ( and ) without the proceeding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for viewing and maintain . the further operations only change the data that the pointer type @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can only change .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the character file changes the output of normal pre @-@ process as input . &quot;
&quot; the predic@@ tive commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences , you can accidentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and merge together . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can customize the proposal before the start
... can manage the simul@@ ate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without doing it
... &quot; runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is similar to the same and merge of single files very similar . you just need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if there is no target folder , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not that merged . to run together , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will inform a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning of the folder is completed , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and any folder found during the scan was shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or use the arrow buttons for the left / right . the directory -@@ menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories of sub@@ directories with which you can switch all the folders and folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double click on a file , the file will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the data file in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the contrac@@ tion promotion cannot be automatically chosen . if that combines together , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black used . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered to be identical if their overall content is identical . then also folder the same color . at folders the age is irrelevant for its colour .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a bl@@ att@@ es , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow , and later when it is old , red becomes . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file types ( e.g. when A folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it can not be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be launched .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ise is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folder are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : put together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after it copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if the files are merged and the newer file will be activated ( uns@@ afe ) , then the exact file will be activated ( uns@@ afe ) , then the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not eliminated , this may not be started . &quot;
&quot; while bringing together a file after the other is processed , and according to other messages , if that result is successful , and according to other messages , if something un@@ expect@@ edly entered . if that is complete , you should make a last check and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file @-@ method of Full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white , and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ itude conflicts will only appear if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) either , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the inter@@ ing @-@ actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then will be used in the three @-@ folder mode , in case of two @-@ folder , B is elected as a destination and used for syn@@ tax A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries you should be in the target file , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be displayed by the specific entries . check these options to avoid uncomfortable surprises : &quot;
to put together all entries : select directories to start / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) : select the promotion of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if through conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you squee@@ ze all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options perform , Sim@@ ul@@ ating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
choose Sim@@ ulation if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes will be made . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; then diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual surgery is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then it opens up a merge window ( see the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re finished with a file , select again directory directory , start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved a corresponding dialog , then a corresponding dialog appears . then performs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you should try again the cause of the problem . if you &apos;re going to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the result . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been compiled individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them up with the later performing of all entries . even if you have assembled these entries , these entries will be processed as done . only if you change the together action , these entries will be brought together once again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory connection with these options :
only files displayed on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate Plac@@ ings : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ .@@ Fol@@ ders do not need to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . a great advantage is that this folder @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file can be adjusted . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a ver@@ tically attribute . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in the pre @-@ setting .
&quot; for links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links are shown . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as normal folder . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis leads to a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ lawful analysis , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and significantly slower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( type an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slow network , it may possibly be quicker , only the amendment of the date and the file size compared to compare this speed . however , this speed is a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; similar to the creation of the amendment . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical , if they are equal in size . e.g. , this can be useful when copying the amendment to be lost . please note with caution . this option is switched on the default file . &quot;
&quot; activated the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was chosen . in this mode , the proposals are selected so that afterwards the two folders are identical . also , the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default file . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is regarded as uns@@ afe , as it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is switched on in the default file . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this is the original version . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ merge opinion will remain visible to the squee@@ ze of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option folder &amp; Text window to switch the main window in the window -@@ menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; most likely , you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , you can also start a file using double @-@ clicking . however , you can also start using the folder menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you read the directory once again : directory menu : new to read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folder . a few things should be observed :

&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link is displayed on a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files possible ) . &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the purpose is currently used as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always start the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right @-@ mouse button on the differences , and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part , displaying the context menu . &quot;
usually requires &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . moreover , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the production of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . together , or merge the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now , it is already compact ) there already exist . also , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GPL @-@ programs for a very long time and I learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or go to it .
&quot; you have not compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably does not find the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the pre @-@ installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; if however only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not treated as identical . if necessary the lines of next to each other , this argument is the most important , this is the case the case . &quot;
the editor notices for each difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and select the Kno@@ pf@@ es A / B / C . that &apos;s necessary to design a conflict simply by clicking the text file and it is much effort to create extra @-@ specific file format that could save this information .
the effort was so far too big . you can always recover a particular version through the selection of a source A / B / C . to process bigger amounts of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing the text , suddenly , No sr@@ c has been swe@@ pt ; and the text does not let itself delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colours to highlight of differences . even more her@@ ding would be confusing , and lack the purpose . use a different editor for it . &quot;
many good ideas and troubles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE gives the folder in your system , where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uncertain , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
&quot; cut off ( Str@@ g @-@ X or re@@ sch@@ alt removal ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or re@@ sch@@ alt installation ) , add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current Cur@@ sort position or replaces the current mark@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program , you have to read after changes to these options the folder with the function update . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences have to be copied . if the target file does not already contain these files , it is likely to be copied after that . ( the behavior is likely to change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default file . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons on selecting the source with the button bar , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they are removed at the button accordingly . &quot;
in the default this option is disabled . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; cau@@ ager , shows a thumb@@ nails of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to change the current programs on the work@@ areas , to end their size or shift it . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; mas@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as current applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button depends on where the right mouse button will set up : if on an application within &amp; k@@ ern@@ ager ; however the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , maxim@@ ise the desktop and Be@@ end . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if applied to an application .
&quot; if this entry field is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; cau@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also move to other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , are shown in the &amp; box ; the names of the virtual working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; to cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working surfaces ; it is composed along with name display , the names are provided with Ord@@ inary figures , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each working space is also displayed as a background in the &amp; box . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; box . otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to allow the selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window will be selected . simple basic corner with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its standard symbol and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; C@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic work spaces known in a 2x@@ n grid ; in a 2x@@ n grid , displays all virtual working spaces in a horizontal and vertical series , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; mas@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ Programme in the control bar . it has the advantage that it changes in size , the windows as symbols or with their contents can display and shift . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right click on the right button of &amp; box ; and subsequent select from the switch of your switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not have any writing to the file , you have to register as a user root , or to use your system administrator . in this file you must register the key win@@ do@@ w@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and to give it a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; as &amp; cau@@ ager , part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; it may be a screen . it may be a part of the screen . you can use &amp; nbsp ; a part of the screen is interesting , so as if you read a list of photos , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; nbsp ; &quot;
&quot; it may be a very powerful application , which is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ scale machines . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re walking , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen is displayed . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window .. The image which is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen , and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the area around the mouse cursor as a mobile layout . alternatively , you can &amp; may cause a selected screen section in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is represented in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cursor . please note , that &apos;s still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button down , so you can count the contents of the magni@@ fier and move . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; key press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the window window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the list will remain firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&quot; it has a lot of functions . it has a lot of features . you can send the larger image to the printer , paste it into a file , turn into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
start or stop the update of the display . the upgrade of the update brings that the needed CPU @-@ time goes against 0 .
&quot; select the Re@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; uses automatically your included file to store files , opening up a new window , print , new@@ ads ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ gements and cl@@ ei@@ vers &amp; etc . . &quot;
&quot; it may also be known as &amp; S@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , so as would you use a magni@@ fier to use the cl@@ adding in a newspaper or a photo . this application is used for different people from research : from research che@@ ur or artists to web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ments . &quot;

&quot; it is thought of a mouse click on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . in addition , it can em@@ ulate the dial with the mouse . this requires a little bit of exercise . &quot;
&quot; however , the pain caused by clicking the mouse is created and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can search for pain that are connected with using your computer , you should have a doctor if this is not yet to happen . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain helps , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , is useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can vary for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; if the mouse is activated , makes it activated &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool . move the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the movement , before the det@@ achment on the mouse button . move the smar@@ ter on the mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little bit exercise , but you get used fast to it . &quot;
this temporary time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
&quot; is intelligent moving upwards , the rot@@ ary time sho@@ ots ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; mou@@ set@@ set@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button , before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no time after the mouse occurs . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently being activated by mouse shifting . this function is enabled , a slow cure after left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow cure after left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time it will be started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound delay appears , you can click on sound &amp; Multimedia ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound @-@ system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound @-@ Pu@@ ffer , which set you on a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers . &quot;
&quot; this option is marked , becomes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; launched at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; please enter the documentation at the moment . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please drag the respective documentation to find out how to start there a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings on the values that were set to opening the dialogue . have already pressed the button , the settings are put back on the stand after the latest pressures of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first with the preference . in particular , the intelligent shifting you should first let yourself be switched off . if you then click on the automatic mouse , you can later increase the intelligent shifting . &quot;
&quot; when you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the answers of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not lead to uneven reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . it is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take into account the mouse . as that happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . but it should quickly be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the contamination can be easily cleaned with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel bracket . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system under@@ breaks the execution of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if in this case you use the intelligent moving pool , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation can no longer leave the drop of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you &apos;re &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can execute yourself one mouse click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and you can work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place . &quot;
solution : use mouse to place the cursor to place the cursor from where you want to have it . but you don &apos;t want to place the mouse on a neutral area of working space where you want to have a keyboard . so secure zones for mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces around the tool@@ bar and menus and the title Head@@ lines of windows .
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shifts , but I don &apos;t make it to edit this text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very well possible to mark this text in the cli@@ p@@ board and then re @-@ insert it . however , it will probably only cause problems to prepare yourself . here are some advice to do this : &quot;
&quot; use the intelligent shifts , if you just start to use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; select the following : lead to the end of the text box a mouse click and keep the envelope button pressed , while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text , and then re @-@ put the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; using the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it needs some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool , must be the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; it should be the case in most systems already . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and that is correct .
&quot; put the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome , and which the actu@@ ation of the buttons is prepared . &quot;
&quot; can also be configured so that there will be a certain time waiting that a pulling process begins before the mouse is left . in this way , also the pulling and lay down with the mouse can be carried out . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which user can let your computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let user let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation , which should be talked again . &quot;
on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ ke scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that will be used later for the text of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture .
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text @-@ fit car . from the text suitable books you can often choose text passages without having to enter them . the text passages can of course be processed . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) , determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) , and a publisher from the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you put k@@ mouth ; correctly , you can enter the sets in the input field you want to hear . each written phrase is attached to the publisher &apos;s memory . you can select from these propositions , which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the site dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two mapping cards , voice and settings , the site of vocabulary and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the mapping menu , you enter the command to the call of the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , insert the code enco@@ ding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two species to pass the text on . select the cross @-@ box , if the text is to be passed on as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross field is not selected , the text is shared as parameters . you can use the following characteristic : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the language version of your language generator depends . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using as a language service , the further settings for the K@@ TT@@ SD service is a &amp; k@@ de ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice . if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text @-@ book or in the bar for text @-@ fitting books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage will be talked directly and additionally inserted in the process memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field , you can choose the editing code for text messages , you can specify whether the text @-@ fit book will be automatically saved at the closing of the editing process . &quot;
&quot; using the selection of text pass@@ able book , the book will be saved . if you choose to throw changes , the text password will not be saved . select your questions , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password should be saved . &quot;
the site Wor@@ ter@@ r site contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box you can select the dictionary for vocabulary for vocabulary .
&quot; with buttons on the side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add to the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list can be used in the input field , and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by picking up the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the list of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how this wei@@ ghted .
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly supplied words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text @-@ application books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text @-@ suitable books as a tree structure are presented .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text message , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or books to add or delete selected text passages and books , you can either use the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or over a fold @-@ fold menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text @-@ suitable books or text passages , you can change your mouse with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the Alt @-@ Alt ; button change . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the publisher . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar is shown by default with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default on the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the refined left and dial , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu is accessed in the menu is a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is displayed on this menu is arranged by default on the editing pane directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the narrow left @-@ hand side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably you have the command for the language issue correct or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the language issue on the multi @-@ part voice issue . ( see site dialog for voice , to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language @-@ trial system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license allows free to use and distribute the festival without limitations . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the attitude of the language , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to the language issue is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; polished language generator . currently he supports only the English language . the license allows free@@ T@@ TS to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without limitations .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the voice , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the language output is then possible with one of the three following commands : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched as standard entries . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ery , so you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last sign of the text so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option will be switched as a default file .
the language @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service available to all &amp; k@@ de ; applications will currently be further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ systems .
&quot; as the setting of the language @-@ generator occurs only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for setting up the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which is installed in the dialog dialog &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs approximately 15 MB storage ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to the text by using the computer . it is already saved a list that the users can always be re@@ spending again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language skills included . on the computer needs a language to be installed .

&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that distinguishes itself in volume or speed . you should at least set up a speaker before you set up , before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printers for the same printer .
&quot; click on the diamond card speaker in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the carto@@ onist speaker is displayed . this appears then automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already decorated speakers appear in this list . the most preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice @-@ overs if an application does not exist .

filter for drawing up filters offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you removed the tags and b from the messages that can be sent by K@@ Mail and also the expression / local / In@@ box since this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , before he is sent to the program of speech . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain defects of voice and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders in . if the output of the screen reader is read , the required orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning is the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . while you can read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome that just the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ orders . each order you encounter from the Kar@@ tei@@ card orders , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text contracts . text messages are intended for issue prolonged texts which have no particular urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except the output of a screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen record , whereas &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reading , this issue will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen revisions . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text contracts , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; news . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string are replacing parts of a text by other text . the parts allow you to specify either as words or as regular expressions ; it is possible to provide with pre@@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better understanding form .
&quot; &amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML , included in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with speaker , you can send orders dependent on the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set up a female voice text , you can read text by K@@ DE News about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. can be read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules after which he is applied to a language issue . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , he will continue to continue the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters , which were set down on the page below . the filter is made in the order in the list from above to below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the common normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed according to the top down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filtering , and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; if there is a list of words or regular expressions , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative pattern . these patterns will be printed in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; type for your filters a name . you can choose this name as you choose , it needs to be distinguished only from the name of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string chains in column , and replaces him in accordance with the string , in accordance with the string , shown in the order from above down@@ wards . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; using these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is used only if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; if a value is listed here , the filter is used only when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
the application @-@ ID run programs you get with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers you must we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the App@@ d@@ ungs @-@ ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you only to type .
&quot; the character set @-@ up filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply to a entry in the box of Di@@ den@@ ants Fil@@ ters . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
when compared to words the character of character filter Reg@@ ular phrases used in the form \ \ s word \ \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( blank ) .
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular phrases . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; apply for &amp; # 160 ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; press , see the package deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; - Re@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can be applied only on well @-@ formed XML . the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient path reaches x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker at a certain speaker , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the mapping card , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify , for example , that texts from a female voice should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker , which provides the text on &amp; kt@@ ops . the speaker can be selected by the speaker . with the speaker at the speaker , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if the text is listed here , the filter is applied , if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; check out this one click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; place the characteristics of the speaker desired by you . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker selected is chosen , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button to show the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your companion settings or to delete all settings .
the speaker can only apply to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box of Di@@ den@@ ants if you apply . you must have at least one condition .
&quot; the language output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand language services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are still more commands you can use . for a list of all commands please enter
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start only t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language skills supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; wrap filters , but when using the module for festival pages , web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so S@@ able ever works . you will also do so , if you do not use this voice to read from websites . you also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found about the ambient path path . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or interference @-@ signs seem to cause mistakes in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that all propositions occur or only che@@ der@@ mal . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option string enco@@ ding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string , and see it . &quot;

&quot; the language sharing , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of currently supported languages you can find on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with each language level that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages at rate . also look at the website of kt@@ ts ; according to information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for voice . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the development team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; switch users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or new ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source archive of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text@@ archive , or have downloaded Tar@@ ball each night , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language reference . for this you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 the first version of the library is used . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf file is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is cr@@ acked in single sets . the user can go back , repeat the issue or break off . &quot;
&quot; if an application provides text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it is possible to request a female English speaker . if you have set up an application whose language English and its gender is female , otherwise it is automatically chosen the best matching speaker . if you want to find out more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the mapping card spokes@@ person on adding , and therefore click on a speaker . as an example , the mapping of the module for festival Interactive is shown . details on the modules can be found under . &quot;
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in path is included you will only have to enter festival .
&quot; select the drawing co@@ ding for text , which is handed over to festival . in general , this setting is automatically made . in general , that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders put volume , speed @-@ speed , and audio @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and this grey , the voice you choose cannot be chosen . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be loaded several seconds on account of their size . if you mark this cross field , these voices are already being loaded to the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ ced to the first set of faster . &quot;
&quot; if this entry cannot be selected , you do not have set up a spokes@@ person ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this entry field is marked , the program window is visible in the system section . otherwise after the start is visible only the symbol icon in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this entry field is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is still reading a text . this gives you the possibility to keep on reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application , which has set the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds the column ID on the mapping card . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can call sales in the order that is selected in the list below , - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( even on the other mapping cards ) adopted and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is used for the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to display the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the diamond card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text messages are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio issue . if a component cannot be selected , has been compiled , either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio issue , select here the audio output . if no output modules appear in the list , you need to install at least one module . do you choose Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device . see also &quot;
&quot; make the speaker speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds about half and 200@@ 0s , % about double normal speed speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click on the application to take up the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this mapping card , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of voice contracts : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders in . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the required orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning is the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot reserved . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; news has the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just like a long text on a web page , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio issue in queue is long . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text contract is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message is active , the introductory sound is played in front of the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this mapping card apply only for normal text orders . for news , warnings and spending of screen re@@ funds there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to get with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy news to be read , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the mapping card messages will be released . &quot;
&quot; mark this stimulation field to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; notify devices , this attitude is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and bu@@ kt@@ ts ; do not read any noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this option is marked , will be noti@@ fications where a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete from it . if you click on the button , a dialogue in which you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , which &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing else , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection field to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts ; should do if an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you selected selected text , enter the text you want . you can use the following column for you : &quot;
you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker that appear in the list on the mapping card as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events to happen . if the action is defined for a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application is executed . otherwise , the action is set to carry out the action , which was set under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list , for this you can set up messages as follows : &quot;
use the button save to store the settings for the notices into a file . use the button store to load the settings in the list . if you want to start with an empty list click Dele@@ te . all entries except all directions are deleted .
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language issue . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , the speaker speed , the volume , the voice of the voice and the pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation by for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are present :
&quot; you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice that is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or ton@@ ations in the Festival @-@ configuration dialog not set to 100@@ ,@@ 000@@ th % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds have to begin with the text , because the first set must be syn@@ ced , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump off or stop and break down , even if the language they do not endor@@ se this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the constitu@@ encies filter filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically add to its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ ción filters , beginners will fall away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest choice is to learn about the setup of the speaker . turn on the mapping card orders , which are subject to speaker . turn on the mapping card orders , which speaker are subject to the speaker . to select , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then begin with the pre @-@ read , since only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; you can stop text messages then at the Kar@@ tei@@ card orders or can break down , even if the voice of this function does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal constitu@@ ent filters will start automatically , if you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ el@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , unless you get off . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
constitu@@ ent filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional signs and add a tab@@ ular signs ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter .
&quot; SB@@ D filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen repression . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from the normal statutes filter filters , you can insert it again by using the file in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot;
&quot; on the mapping card speaker , you can write the speaker settings for application . the mapping card is displayed , if &quot;
use of the standard hook ( the top on the top card speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ reference properties .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you don &apos;t delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , who initially corresponds to the original properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired manual properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired intercom . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
highlight this cross box if the property should prevail over other features . you can also put several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when entering the output , this property is rarely treated . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language , lies ahead , if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the narr@@ ator , who is most likely to delete , click on the selection button , and then use on speaker , who corresponds the following below . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number is input 0 required ) .
k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is troubled and &amp; kt@@ ops . if the problem is not solved , you may need to record G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , perhaps a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ output over Al@@ sa does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I have a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears , which states : &quot; &quot; should open PC@@ M &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on your system there is the problem that conflicts in Al@@ sa occur that prevent the equivalent opening of several PC@@ M devices . tips for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Bio ect@@ .org .
I have loaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use them in festival but k@@ tt@@ s@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / share / share / share the new voice . as instructions can provide you with the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; at the Kar@@ tei@@ Card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program needs to be installed and available on the mapping variable path for speaker . some synthes@@ iz@@ ations like Festival Interactive offer itself on the mapping card for speaker . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speed speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; ( see ) , you can change the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate you either to change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML ren@@ oun@@ tain , and set the speaker speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it read that web pages read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice before . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , S@@ able gender does not work to work . so the festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file produces for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber with the gender @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own string , and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ r@@ st or go back . on the mapping orders , the order is just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; inter@@ points sign ( point , question mark , compres@@ sing , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for this sign instead of a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
&quot; check out in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ stre@@ amer , by using G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio issue . if your system is also counts , you cannot stop at the same time playing music and start a text . if your system also counts , if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; stop , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of the speaker speed , but otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x using the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ et archive ) , you can sign up as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removes , or at least just created on request . &quot;

&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and it will support multiple voices and languages . with many voices you can set up volume , intercom speed , and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ; set . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help to read in the instructions , which are delivered with festival . would you like to read web pages , you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these votes you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission . &quot;
&quot; this voice uses the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Chess / . if you set up the Russian votes , you have to enter for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) co@@ ding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are therefore first shown on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must code co@@ ding on ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must code co@@ ding on an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ll@@ ic like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ iz@@ ers will be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then takes over the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded by

&quot; the Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ ack@@ able language courses , who supports currently only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple language profi@@ ci@@ ve with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can set up neither ton@@ ous , volume , even talk speed . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions therefore as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ step @-@ language courses , which works with di@@ ph@@ o@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o translated text in Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language skills produces the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can set voice , audio height , talk speed , and volume over k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . &quot;
&quot; download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c , or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file . &quot;
&quot; on the Carto@@ graphic map , choose a voice and put the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly . &quot;
&quot; E@@ pos is a free , qu@@ ack@@ able language courses for the Czech and Slov@@ ak language . he is a simple language learning with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; can you only set up the volume in this language . &quot;
&quot; start k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr . on the mapping map , click Add . select the c@@ ef@@ ish or Slov@@ ak language speakers . if the E@@ pos programs do not enter into your path , enter the path to the programs on the mapping text . enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; E@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language courses , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you have to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can set up neither ton@@ ous , volume , even intercom speed . &quot;
&quot; the command l@@ mode du@@ l allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language skills , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line can be controlled . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the language output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; box center ; enabling the administration of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ Connect center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ Connect center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; creating a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module networking settings in &amp; box ; indicated . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; will be started . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not need to install and configure . physical devices and their drivers have to already be installed and configured so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and adjust the setting properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed for installing &amp; Linux ; installed and furnished . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded through adaptation of the following files , according to the core version , loaded : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings will be loaded , if the option network settings in &amp; box ; index is selected . in the startup of the module network settings , this , the platform used by the system will be automatically recognized . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the main selection is offered . it is the platform that best meets your distribution and release . by setting the setting of non @-@ once , this selection can be determined permanently . at the next start of network settings then this selection will automatically exp@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; the change of networking settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are presented , which means , changing settings is not possible . in the system management mode , you can get in the system management mode by clicking the button system administration mode at the lower end of the module . it is the input of the password required . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three horse@@ men : &quot;
the tab network interfaces is used for managing network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . all available network devices can be performed from the following tasks :
the settings shown on network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button &apos;s button . set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only fundamental TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button of the button below , displaying the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection automatic , the TCP / IP @-@ settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be done with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP , can be selected in accordance with the system , in accordance with the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , is selected . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field of net@@ mask , the sub @-@ net@@ mask is to set . &quot;
&quot; this option marks , initi@@ ates the system interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered into this dialog are shown as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would be used to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the required need . switch on an in@@ activated network unit is selected by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off according to the needs of a activated network , either by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface , the interface to the network is to be selected , in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain approach by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can understand only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the solution to the nam@@ esp@@ ace part of the rider solution allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a tra@@ int and execution or descent in the list with the buttons , or set up in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; from the group &quot; &quot; Calcul@@ ator &quot; &quot; to the nam@@ esp@@ ace can be added to a DNS server . it will add the new name new name server . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator , choose one entry and click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog box . &quot;
the list of especially well @-@ known computers describes machine name @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when boats are available when no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
&quot; usually , the list contains only known computers some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still in the test and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well known computer and click the &quot; &quot; Add @-@ click &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple Ali@@ as @-@ names , de button add several times and enter the further alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a specially known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog shared computer is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be ab@@ used . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm packages ) it ranges when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphi@@ cally interface like a package or installation tool for your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation is sufficient of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not but in addition , the development packages with libraries and others are needed . &quot;
&quot; this will only be recommended to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf . however , the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; modify configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of PCs is introduced into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
IP @-@ netz@@ works with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) has never been found . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been found in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge that uses IP address to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact person who uses a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case the IP address can not be selected just as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when placing an own small ( home ) network the IP address is chosen from a specially reserved area for this purpose , to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so any use of any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , the access to the internet can be made available for such machines by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually addresses in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all calcul@@ ators are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the two the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP re@@ directing . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot;
in this part you find the configuration files which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamic with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as defined . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted out by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can therefore occur as expected . &quot;

&quot; when all tasks and ambient variables were entered or modified , you must still save the cr@@ on@@ tab . select to save the menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are then active only then . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard tab ; in case you select , see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users to possess extended per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . used the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the schedules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a P@@ OS@@ IX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; the first goal was to store several archives on a tape . it was the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the second goal was to create several archives on a tape . it was the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the second goal was to create a question that my wife did , how much longer it takes when you make ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be involved from &amp; k@@ dated ; it may happen on three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Sh@@ ould ; take the band back and read the pre@@ tense information about the gang . realize &amp; k@@ dat , the fore@@ play on the band is not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ acher is looking for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol that the band has been involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be brow@@ sed through the signing of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the gang , first the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change of the tool@@ bar for the band to realize that the integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dated ; form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; a band types need to be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; box ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; box ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; ger@@ dat ; this procedure usually does a form@@ atting of the tape advance , DAT drives however not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; ger@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the gang , all the data on the band is lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process the band will be automatically involved and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the security files that can be done on three types : &quot;
select a file or a folder in a local file . it will only secure this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files are stored in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and choose in the menu Si@@ ghts ...
once the backup was introduced the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue will be backup . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file , or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder will be tested . &quot;
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog settings will appear for verification . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , dialogue will be examined . this dialog shows the progress of verification process as well as data transmission and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can establish the re @-@ establish , the files that are to be restored will be marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the band &apos;s entry . it is only restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
&quot; select the files from one of the archives with a tick . only , the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are restored . &quot;
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialogue settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re @-@ producing . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data transmission and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file based on the band@@ content . this procedure del@@ etes the index all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this gives you a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be made . the list of security files will be automatically updated accordingly .
&quot; for any folder listed under backup files , the files contained in the same file system are , as the folder . folder , which are on other file systems , can be arranged separately under backup files . each entry is seen by tar independent from the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created .
&quot; the functionality of the buttons files , gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot;
the settings can set you up on the menu item at the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device work@@ book ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ modeling variant of the band device .
&quot; if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is involved the command mt to the drive . on some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat , to lock out the throw at the band@@ work station . possibly , this attitude does not work with all band@@ work stations . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , when filling the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is thrown out . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ date ; in any case you share the block size for your band flow . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it sends a file to the top of the gang . this file should only cover a memory block on the belt . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band ID . the format of this string is written name : seconds , where calcul@@ ator &apos;s name is the full name of the system on which the band is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch where the band was form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dated / .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup system . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; System@@ log ; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system can deposited the different protocol files . furthermore , experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; System@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine makes in the background . the task is suitable for in@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where you can receive information about your system or where the system files the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; system log ; experienced users provide quick access to information on issues relating to their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some enhanced functions , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; col@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba . &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the scre@@ enshot , displays &amp; col@@ log ; functions are available , with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sor@@ ting . the individual options for sor@@ ting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start is tried &amp; k@@ systematic log ; initially , the main protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll . if the protocol files are normally not displayed in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or stored string . in the default setting , the selection box will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines are displayed . then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns , the string of the filter search is included . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry in the filter protocol . for instance , select the name of the filter protocol , and carry out the name of a process , so shows you &amp; col@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of the stage error are shown with a show@@ y color as protocol @-@ lines of stage note . the color @-@ lines of protocol @-@ lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to view the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window to show up all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; System@@ log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub @-@ window and manage . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ systematic log@@ .@@ forum software @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more current information about the sources of &amp; system log ;
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; you can also find in the following the folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ systematic log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it editor ( and in the following also named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program boot at the high system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more efficient , and at the same time it is more flexible than the traditional BSD - In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I do not know anything : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a new installation and re @-@ format . the kernel sees first under / etc after an In@@ it file . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there a one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are held directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following more :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service , which would start to boot up the system or change to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services , do not include such things as set@@ can , which will only be started . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under the / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out a little , what to do with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places according to the program in@@ it and start the first that it finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ level Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and the 3 change . be very careful when you have brought about it , then you get it repaired by entering the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it begin to enter all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder are not correct files . instead of each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
&quot; as starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts , in fact , on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server level , which leaves only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , moreover , I could also have a user @-@ level level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
&quot; here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand device is simple to say not to say trivial : simply drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six running level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by getting it somewhere else . this happens only if they draw an entry from the area of availability system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you choose to copy them into a new area . to just select it on a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the menu or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : there is no possibility to restore entries , which were thrown into the trash . therefore , be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the t@@ ulator key to activate the different work@@ areas ( availability system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons , to make a selection of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to shift an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the variable number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the t@@ ulator button to switch between different fields . use the t@@ ulator key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they will be executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . otherwise , the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) are removed . otherwise it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise , changes to the pres@@ ets will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine will start anew . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard run@@ level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , then you must edit extra files in / etc that are only available in these distribution . please read the details in the distribution guide . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately is not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning to expand the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache / htt@@ p@@ d ) just without notice when their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; once you have made changes , you must save it . either you use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; the main window consists of two mapping cards , the user and the user @-@ party list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
some mapping cards are only displayed when you have extended system preferences . only if you have extended system preferences . only if you can make space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users . further mapping cards will appear if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
&quot; the Kar@@ tei@@ card Pass@@ word administration appears , if shadow -@@ passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD . &quot;
&quot; this mapping card appears only if for at least a file file system limited ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here , for each user parameter , the space restrictions are available in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually . the current file system is selected by using the field file system with space limited .
&quot; the mapping card groups will be informed of the selected users . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Prim@@ acy group . furthermore , the user can mark in other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager , remove and modify the default system , remove the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove operating systems , remove , change , change and more . &quot;
