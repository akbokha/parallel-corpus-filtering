<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. it manages pictures in high quality but needs very large files. with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open-format file that has been developed by Adobe Systems.

<seg id="410">"the & publication came; tool colour effects provide four fares-effects, a solar-effect effect, a neon effect, a neon effect, and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar, even Sabatians, an effect of this was created if one had partially developed a short flash light and subsequently completed the colour of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas of darker and the colors were completed by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatively negative of the picture. this tool allows you to jun this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls solar power. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase will finally create a negativity that is not to create on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar-effect effect. the original image is (1) and the original (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called" Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a satiation, making it a stronger contradiction effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellished many photos. "</seg>
<seg id="415">"the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a few photographers, especially those who are hardly any landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilter simulates Neonlight to contrasts. the parameter level controls the strength of the outcome and the slider repeats the strength of the Neonlight. with large images, the filter can give the whole CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color-counter and the luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you are used to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light conditions you can gain the reverse problem: a great choice to reduce saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness is going to increase. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated for the improvement of the exposing. even if the dialogue to this tool appears very complicated, you need only the field of slider. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, of active canals or the selected area. under the graphene, three sliding are in the inside, and those can be shifted to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the picture. the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scalding: with this selection box can be adjusted for pictures of a digital camera. in pictures the large areas of a constant colour contain the linear histogram of a single column. in this case the logotype-making use is useful.</seg>

<seg id="479">& Check has come; three different tools for depth are available. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharper is a traditional tool for depth. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, granary images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges around a picture sharper. in fact, it works rather more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">"this is due to the digitalization process colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this is because of the digitalization process, the same phenomenon makes it a little vulnerable. this, the same phenomenon can be seen when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequent depth as normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG pictures, a camera has often been applied. images in the raw format must always be spared during the processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner turn a edge filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain usable results by looking for a photo with the sharpness of the sharpness. that allows you to resume using the menu corrigidity.</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should deal with this, however, because the results are not very natural: the most useful technology to sharpens the edge of the edges, but also amplify the smoker. you will reach it over the menu-fixing Refocus. among Refocus you will find further more information and a comparison of all techniques for depth."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crisp. the solution, the image to draw a little soft, is much easier than sharps. use the tool for softness with the menu in return corrigiing softness and experiment with settings. the preview display on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred maskering is a very good tool to remove the veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. this window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often generate good results and should be tried first. if you make the awkward mask too strong, smoke and the impression of ditats near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses one like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore you should sharpens pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the blurred image of which the original is added. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference. this way, one can define a minimum change between the tones between sharps and therefore more beautiful mistakes in faces, Heavenues and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">This & publication came; tool Refocus focused on an image through improvement of the sharpness. it used to be protected by the protected discharge of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to zoom as a picture. this is better approach to sharpening the photo. this is better approach than just trying the picture to sharpen the photo. it uses better results than unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by using colours Refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circlamp fold much better than the Gauck's Faltung. the Gauck's Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel blocks. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauck's Faltung in most cases is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular field: this is the key parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. you can set a higher value when your image should be very blurred but then pay attention to Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase of the smoking filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1; 0, the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value is worth the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"it is the radius of the Gauls' edge. in most cases, this is caused to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use this value to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"Matrizensize: this value determines good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular edge or the Gauck 'sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the area of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as and shop buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any given parameters that you have set will therefore be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to carry out all the cutting, color, and intention of intention on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image before you change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately that are not immediately visible that leave later inconvenient artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, producing unsharp masons produces better results than sharpens. this could be caused by the blurred masons as a sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it is always possible to create unsharp masons. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna Filter one can never show that it is the optimal linear filter. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original insharp color image must be corrected. this picture was made using an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to enough light for the car-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field of depth of digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>

<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum sewage factor about ally. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value therefore to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves bigger structures. this is necessary if very much smoker, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, he must be set higher than 3."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= These setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. need always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good geny for music of young, portable devices and autostereosystems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that entered manually or through the program automatically from the freeDB is available via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed with & audiocreator; and the code name to create the folder and file name, as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with code programs, there is often a combination of programs for the code of code and these parameters. the manual or the help of the Kodiers explain the switches for these programmes."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) If MP3s are added with lame (English: day) if MP3s are added with lame; the result will be added: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download the audio CDs, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer. it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer. it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer. it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer. it is to be noted that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer. it is to be noted that here are only spoken by text: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>

<seg id="1532">"in & audiocreator; the email address is used as the one in the system (send an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address used by the server is not used (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"in many countries, copies of the main database. if & audiocreator; it is designed to use freeDB, the geographically closest to the next mirror server will be needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit with freedb.org provides a list of mirrors for the online call of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which exlessee is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files to save on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely in source... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must be installed first before it is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for storing WAV files, the codifier and hence the desired file format is selected. the first opening entries can be added to the encoders (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of free compression for audio data) on the tab. other codiers can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codifier package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the coaster can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined co-operation. more information about Kodierer are located in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a code, further information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a window window (eg; console)." lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed body."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the equipment of the & CD; / DVD drives, the spelling and readerc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are trying to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copier audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have read the complete manual, all understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set everything up and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"it must be found cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. any suitable package for lame can be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can always do."</seg>

<seg id="1547">"the first section covers the basic setting of & audiocreator;, something which probably is done only once and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes how to read a & CD, which must be repeated for any read & CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we determine to use the encoding machine (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps), where the files are stored and which structure is used. as we are lazy, we split the program to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will not most likely be reading a & CD, if the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is given to the readable program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for Synthesizers who are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map general-MIDI events translated in events that understands the synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map showing all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change Change patch to Trumpet and thus getting a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you just have a sound card, you do not need MIDI-map because all sound cards are compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM-devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary requirements for the playing of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. however, that each occurrence is a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your Map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support may offer for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, as the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equals is ignored. it is assumed that the GM are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and no line for any of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds, which need this instrument to put on the tone with number M. if your keyboard is not supporting a gun (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun. this is what you wear in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"if so now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun), it takes 100 (the drum to your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch of patch is meant, with which each sound represents another Persian instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the sound height of the always same drum (as some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to give up sounds on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of the lines is very important, just as their availability. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to form sounds on the Persian-channel channel. look at yourself as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to switch some channels to others. for example, if you want to switch the first and second channel, make this quite simply in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELP section has 16 lines, numbered between 0 and 15, built according to the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is used on the Channel N. if you use the keymap option the keymap is used to change the patch on this channel! if you use the keymap option which will change the patch on this channel. in this case always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the Percab patch on the perklift channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio will be multiply in which ratio of the Pitch-Bender-Event sends to the value of n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file is not decimal number)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this option is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch higher. unfortunately, but try some keyboards to play two tones up to an octave. unfortunately, try to try to taste the right value on your keyboard, you'll have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole row pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos see which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view also to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't have more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view in the menu settings below the point of channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the pace-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"so you can change the pace of a song. so, if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it includes the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. this allows the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone else & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file requires about 50 KB, while an mp3-file can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have compiled a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have this happened because & kmid; without Awe support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download a source of distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home)"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merger was very complicated because one of the contributors had fixed many changes, while at the same time there had been fixed in many places. another programmer had changed a lot in the same file. the result had been numerous conflicts at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what changed right within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the redeemulation had changed. this changes had been a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs. later many more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare quickly text, just copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function made a lot of work, was the same and merged of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a fully-defined file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also, 3-ways composing is fully supported. this is useful if two people are working independently of a piece of code and displays changes. in this editor, you can edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can manage the result directly."</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also in the same and merged folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and also for the possibilities of current color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can view a look at the summary in the column at the left side of the column. (no more trouble when somebody is changing.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"when a file is equal, and the other is different in a row, then the color shows that the file is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the tipparwork easier by using only the file name from the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner2 folder 3-o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening-dialog allows the manual command of file name, selecting the file browser (file...) or select a last opened file from the list. opening dialog you will not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is performed with two files."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"when combined together, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to determine immediately a output file. you can also get this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The insertion button will open a dialogue with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and insert: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall via a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes, it would like to create several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively great deal. they would have to load only two appropriate files, and then compare and compare them. now you can simply copy the relevant sections simply to copy, then compare."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently there is nothing out of & kdiff3; pull out. only the case of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program than cut and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window, the info line contains a different color. (note that Windows C is optional.) Everyde info line has a different color.

<seg id="2304">"the three source boxes are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presettings can be changed over the settings menu)."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is recognized, one sees the color that file differs. when both files differ, the color scheme is different. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merged)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"links besides the text is displayed. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. when white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes.

<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the merger column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the particular source file has no lines. if the pointer is enabled, the line will be shown on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the comparison window) also has a info line with the inscription issue:, the file name and [change] if you have processed the result. usually it contains already text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the saving deactivated!!! (use the buttons, to next soldering / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)"</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you're & kmousetool; under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can execute yourself one mouse click. this is reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can work as usual.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& Systemlog; helps users understand what your machine makes in the background. the task is suitable for inexperienced users who don't know where you can receive information about your system or where the system files the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & system log; experienced users provide quick access to information on issues relating to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some enhanced functions, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & collog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba."</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the screenshot, displays & collog; functions are available, with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorting. the individual options for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start is tried & ksystematic log; initially, the main protocol file of the system - the system protokoll. if the protocol files are normally not displayed in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually do not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or stored string. in the default setting, the selection box will be displayed automatically, so that only log lines are displayed. then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns, the string of the filter search is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can also select another entry in the filter protocol. for instance, select the name of the filter protocol, and carry out the name of a process, so shows you & collog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of the stage error are shown with a showy color as protocol-lines of stage note. the color-lines of protocol-lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to view the process identification (PID) in the column process (PID) in the column process, so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the option for new lines in the context menu of the main window to show up all new added protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& Systemlog; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub-window and manage. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystematic log.forum software-software.org. Dort you can find more current information about the sources of & system log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystematic log; you can also find in the following the folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystematic log; in & kde; Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; system V Init editor (and in the following also named as named) as & ksysv. this section guides a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program boot at the high system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more efficient, and at the same time it is more flexible than the traditional BSD - Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I do not know anything: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binaries is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a new installation and re-format. the kernel sees first under / etc after an Init file. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there a one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are held directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following more:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service, which would start to boot up the system or change to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services, do not include such things as setcan, which will only be started. such calls are according to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should be on the one hand under the / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out a little, what to do with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places according to the program init and start the first that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-level Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and the 3 change. be very careful when you have brought about it, then you get it repaired by entering the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it begin to enter all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder are not correct files. instead of each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"as starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts, in fact, on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server level, which leaves only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., moreover, I could also have a user-level level, which & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand device is simple to say not to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six running level to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by getting it somewhere else. this happens only if they draw an entry from the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you choose to copy them into a new area. to just select it on a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the menu or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: there is no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown into the trash. therefore, be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tulator key to activate the different workareas (availability system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons, to make a selection of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to shift an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the variable number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the tulator button to switch between different fields. use the tulator key to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. otherwise, the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) are removed. otherwise it will be restored by & ksysv. otherwise, changes to the presets will be stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will start anew. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel at a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you must edit extra files in / etc that are only available in these distribution. please read the details in the distribution guide."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately is not a standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning to expand the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (such as & eg; Apache / httpd) just without notice when their configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"once you have made changes, you must save it. either you use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry in the menu file."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"& kuser; the main window consists of two mapping cards, the user and the user-party list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties."</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some mapping cards are only displayed when you have extended system preferences. only if you have extended system preferences. only if you can make space restrictions (Quota) for users. further mapping cards will appear if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the Karteicard Password administration appears, if shadow -passwords, or for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this mapping card appears only if for at least a file file system limited (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota group on the file system). here, for each user parameter, the space restrictions are available in KB:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted for each file system individually. the current file system is selected by using the field file system with space limited.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the mapping card groups will be informed of the selected users. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Primacy group. furthermore, the user can mark in other groups by selecting them in the large field."</seg>
