&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , I danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who was with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ d , who was the top federal court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; me it was , as if this is the absolute truth , everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only been reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I said : &quot; &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very black@@ ish love @-@ cover written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the xen@@ ophobia and the racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his bot@@ t@@ edness .
he never keeps the mountain behind the mountain how to say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ am and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people reacted to his statements and voted for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes which he won at the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party nom@@ ination candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte I asked me ?
I was able to reconcile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deep natural man , with whom I talked about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also the Tr@@ umps world@@ view not with the of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ umps In@@ tolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced among Sandy B@@ ahr , which fighting for their lives long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits into the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise words helped me a lot with my career . &quot;
these people and those through them em@@ bodied my love for America .
&quot; while comfor@@ ting his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presidential dates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his dis@@ regard for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to miss these things , I broke almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ists .
&quot; one of my friends said to me , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and indicates a in@@ capacity to understand the ones that act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the h@@ ectic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most know are , for tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who say the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; : as much as &quot; &quot; drawing of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities . &quot; &quot; word from white in appearance on the White and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much like s@@ ling@@ s@@ trau@@ ma , as it was the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always like the Americas is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the White America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the hel@@ m , say it . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a written &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
would Muslims have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; brun@@ t the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a lonely and sound@@ less &quot; &quot; NO ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; that the music , which is played at both locations , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but also of the nearby splendid ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has now played in the municipality : one of children and adults @-@ related sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs @-@ abuse and the Bank @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; but after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI .
once they come from the school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to go their great passion .
&quot; they come across and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ bo for Day trumpet , trumpet , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest @-@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made from re@@ ver@@ wert@@ et@@ em waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where recycling has begun under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez to transform parts of apost@@ asy into tools . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate gases , viol@@ a , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guit@@ ars , sa@@ vers , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all made of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of The Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the early days : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se , and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked out in the trash , because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a waste from apost@@ oline .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra which plays out instruments from re@@ active material and that the recycled Orchestra is called . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) stands out the musical performance :
the world is generated every year about a billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here it turns him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication happens within the scope of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , that ship had already been held in front of Africa &apos;s illegal fishing fishing before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly dra@@ fted and little inclined to welcome a legal bre@@ cher of this kind at their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed rapidly against the ship . they refused to give up one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing shelter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime surrounded by countries that they just refused , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ undering of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , crosses criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries stop ) was founded . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are apart from Somalia and Madagascar , who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at the time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to apply . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by the inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and types are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the snow emp@@ ires , the actions of these events happen in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of lists , updates to susp@@ ects activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to detect the authorities , ships of fish which fish in bad fields , too - such that suggests that a ship invites its own fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the ships involved have a fish license where they were on the road , and possibly , whether they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; countries that are opposed to illegal fishing , can then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that the illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD to lost sales , which loses eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into eastern African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing ages that pul@@ ls the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
&quot; their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit license papers , indication of ph@@ anta@@ sia , the fish protected species and the fish in nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an incomplete organised control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could not use illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You dar@@ ed my port not to walk . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale slip hole tries F@@ ISH @-@ i now to close .
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its inception , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , which had been distributed counterf@@ eit@@ ed licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that were used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has found volati@@ le ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority on the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances and preserved . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that is to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i to help , susp@@ ects ships precise , precise ships . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , will also help to hide the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be obtained by satellites Georgian . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system , which connects various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team in African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believe . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and through which the position of each trac@@ e@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this is just meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trusts have a similar project to run , in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only sense criminals but they also ab@@ rupt .
ships used earlier without a license and barely have to reck@@ on with consequences are now aware that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now taken a 33 % increase in fisheries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 doors , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tu@@ pp@@ networks , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now have other countries to copy &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , a hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six different countries have joined forces , so called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; With security , it is the goal to develop even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia had its first big triumph in October : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road with false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were hau@@ led networks , which meanwhile were forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking up against Gre@@ ko 1 , the a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the World Sea . Emma Br@@ yce is free professional journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the topic environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is more pointed to : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to regain the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , reacted by the Vene@@ tians , in whose eyes the talks about the political and economic crisis of the country had gone into emp@@ t@@ iness by being gathered in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of MÃ©@@ rida and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country has deterior@@ ated continuously and is noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians through an acute lack of food and medicine .
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the officers of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . however , the acceptance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes up the context of the government member following : &quot;
&quot; under the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the incub@@ ation and violence is considered to be the highest in the world ( inflation rate ) and a serious lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government . &quot;

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and distr@@ actions . &quot;
especially big waves hit the news about polished repression in the central @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed forces of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators , who hold the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a bear no redness , because you could see anything else , what many nation@@ als have not yet ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already doing the round that forms the scale of repression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister of ministers - this was demonstrated by the presence of innumerable people across the street .

&quot; this is an adap@@ ted version of a interviews from Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as by now , He said Qui@@ j@@ ano within the framework of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the Brus@@ de , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military bodies in prison La Per@@ la , who he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he held the family secrecy for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that which was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret magic .
when a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ meri@@ e@@ dic@@ ated . while the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father from 1976 until 1978 , was his father of the secret service department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor because of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child is charged . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent for his child , and as this child chose to be a path of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was with a boy who made war sports . &quot;
all n@@ ailed him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are a Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have sent you with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass only on that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I must save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party of Argentina . &quot;
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me ; I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought I was fine . because my father had educated me .
on the military base I had to destroy paper that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ za , Books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to rise . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bit wrapped , and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects have been removed , and signed me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I se@@ wn , and saw a couch on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated straight there .
&quot; they rarely found a man with hand@@ sha@@ king into the bed , poured him with water and j@@ ir@@ oned him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the frame there was in it in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos; I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ hel@@ pers , and had to bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated at hand and feet .
near the entrance qu@@ au@@ ed people still lying on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you do so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
&quot; I have dis@@ missed &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were called offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put a man together and killed .
&quot; ( according to survivors of civilians , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ der chambers . &quot;
the road where you came here are also the way to which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then been tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the show of man and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of the &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; was like it - it was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war be@@ ech was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military characters , which one ab@@ uses an enemy that one fought . &quot;

&quot; but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... looking , then that is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer in gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and to ste@@ al all of them .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I rep@@ lied , and thou that thou sa@@ west on the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and get you hanging . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we need nobody else ! &quot;
that was my father .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that at that time , on which I took a jacket and a wheelchair pul@@ lover out of wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators have been with this crime . I ref@@ utes no problem , they can lay me on the burden what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only once children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
one is developing further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ eri@@ ed during the dictatorship of people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children do ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother whose mother was killed .
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I asked me again and again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have just been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not also had families to whom they were given to their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that you can do a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they made machines to eliminate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something &quot; , &quot; my father said . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to show my father , was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I have had to experience .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no death .
&quot; I felt distr@@ acted and asked me , what the whole over@@ laid patriot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually were good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you made horrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; but he ref@@ utes me only &quot; &quot; Well then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I submitted the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me for I am pre@@ occupied . I finally told my own father .

the sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto in which one can prolong its license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers have opened a new opened center in which one can extend its leaders in the last month , in the last month a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word could mean the Japanese word ( kor@@ ean below sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; , but maybe also with bows to thank &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as a &quot; fri@@ ghtful car . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the false translation was available from the 1st to the 20th of September to electronic display in the input area , and in the building itself . &quot;
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine in the social media has been widely shared .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os , he was also , who made attention to the local time . &quot;
the in Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simple , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; shall be &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible Auto@@ driver &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the com@@ edy , although gram@@ mati@@ cally , has not been completely correct as &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( older drivers ) . &quot;
&quot; the police pre@@ fecture of Kyoto pre@@ dict@@ ates himself for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error had already been included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sorry that older people were occupied by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set out something more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; awesome &quot; older cars in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are ent@@ an@@ gled in accidents , but definitely cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 was caused in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents . this is equivalent to 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors created 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , her share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents declined in total , the proportion of seniors has risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the name was not mentioned in the version of Article Comments to the light , which demonstrate which prejudices some Japanese apparently he@@ wn against older car drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible &quot; drivers &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I do not think that is a real translator error .
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is spread so prevalent in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ bet you need two important features : passive voice knowledge , in order to understand the initial text and to use active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother tongue . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native language for example should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo from Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be attributed to lacking understanding of the surplus , cost grounds or the relatively small number of English speakers that may learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have no foreign employees to make translations of our company internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is made as the best ones , are made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo from Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ r@@ ens and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases created by mechanical translations , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English formulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that are often t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors might be acceptable or at least harmless . but of large companies or the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations in the future . &quot;
Venezuela : protest and C@@ ens@@ ored measures on the Internet and on television
&quot; main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Frei@@ es surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7th , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they no longer have access to the online transm@@ itter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that the Internet access of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will no longer be accessible .
&quot; also other on @-@ line transm@@ it@@ ters , recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who res@@ isted the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the responsibilities of Parliament to the executive and the upper court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection may be , and recommended the user , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activate your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ating about protests in 2014 since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Tele@@ com@@ s would continue to report them with fin@@ es and lock@@ ings when they continued to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have signed up with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buy two lit@@ res le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ VE@@ filter later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other on @-@ line channels . this also concerns the website that the National Assembly carries out its meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous im@@ itations of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had yiel@@ ded that the local Internet provider will sometimes use DNS . this is a technique , resulting from the DNS server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNA , the server responds or denied the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS @-@ Sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net

Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in police @-@ food .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast again . &quot;

in Paraguay a lot of girls will be slave to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina for the rights of children and collects testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which she did not live together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her degree degree at the university she returned to the house again and heard , how the owner of the house spoke of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the ones from which has become something &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the store is quite simple : a big family with little money handed over their under@@ year old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in the exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to afford countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and be victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be lifted up in the framework of a contract , which you can not lift up . &quot;
these as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls who have been hit by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - recorded testimony to say and denoun@@ ced from the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
&quot; she tried to call things on behalf of the name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , guaranteed in general breastfeeding . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family who complete their daughter in faith that they will complete their position in society and to make something out of themselves , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl with their faith and made exploitation with the faith that they would give someone a chance that otherwise no education would get lost , and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl comes out , his family will only learn many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced them .
&quot; in January 2016 the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº showed their bodies of fierce beats . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of former Mil@@ ky Fer@@ re@@ ira Tom@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a official office in the office of the former military office .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira has suffered a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n as long as they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the assass@@ inated child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep authority of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest environments and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the Eh@@ ep@@ a@@ ars and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a great study of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , which her Cri@@ adi@@ ta was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; when the case comes to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n is to be a landmark , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is in court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k who worked her father and her father lost his work .
&quot; their brothers had to go all work , and began to sell , on the road or on the market of sweets to make money . &quot;
but they all went on to the school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time to learn from time to learning . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ ti@@ fied the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was with learning , the more free time had them . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but got also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power from 1954 to 1989 , who was in power until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings of the house@@ holder of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial from Op@@ ti@@ fications like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he tried to convince her , to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator no belief . &quot;
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the house@@ holder had someone found to listen , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there . &quot; that said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , that belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ Ã­ , would be back home to their native Guaran@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; her Lord feared that they had the education they had allowed to lose , they explained . &quot;
&quot; you , however , was completely clear that it was paid for all that she had paid by them to pay with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a were discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken , Mob@@ bing and Shi@@ p@@ ans are exposed to which cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to the school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that somebody who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the society understands the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go

draft legislation writes Egyptian users to register social media to register with the government
image of pix@@ ab@@ ay is changing by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Parliam@@ entary MPs recently agreed to &quot; regulations on the regulations regarding use and usability of social networks .
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , individuals and users have to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a position would then be set up to give citizens a permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of acceptance of the law , individuals and users have to register on the site of the site with its proper name and recruitment numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do this , that could be a punishment of up to six months in jail or money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agli@@ ves and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; every application , which runs through the internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced as it is accepted , since the draft no indication indicates how Egyptian authorities should not register how they are to register those who are unable to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliam@@ entary and Pat@@ rons of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received by the Tele@@ communications Ministry a username and password &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt is planning to inv@@ ade a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts and experts on the spot are skep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as well as they can control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , this means that they will be a strong surveillance system to be up to citizens who apply a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor citizens &apos; activities and to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative of Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating scars is present in the area of the picture , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the European Parliament proposed Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy presented a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a li@@ felong prison sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the region of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal welfare H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature is working to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , that ro@@ bes through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of its habitat , and as they always find less prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video shows , the per@@ si@@ can Leopard indicates the only remaining predat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecosystem &apos; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video presents that they have a big cat at the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; when trained Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational activities of Nature Iraq for the past six years .
she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to seeing that protective zones for wildlife in the region of Kurdistan are established .

&quot; in the beginning of March 2017 , documented for the Nor@@ theast Japan , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made for the North Japan of Japan . a major earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper is located in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a prestigious pre@@ fecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring glob@@ als Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced into force , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had finished whole coastal cities out of the map . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows what progress has been reached for six years to re @-@ establish the life of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of the persons concerned themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total 77 percent of the scheduled spare @-@ houses ( in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success amongst the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was able to see Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one has always endeav@@ ored , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by accommodation shel@@ ters ( the most important , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald .
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima living in 2011 , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated trees , which have been cr@@ amped in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here with 34 percent .
the status of works and daily pre@@ fec@@ tures in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; during nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y were re @-@ recorded . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of farming in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the Atom@@ ic case , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destructive agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered and again recovered , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far from be@@ aten . &quot;
the tourist pay in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate have again been 90 percent on the same stand as before the tragedy . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand can only be 75 percent here .
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is harder to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also , as it has changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in the introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung writes :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that still not enough has been done in disasters prevention . &quot;
as it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
&quot; in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the position of ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the enormous earthqu@@ akes and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside of the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people , have been converted to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , moved to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the booth of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants still live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ phy , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ations still have to compete in homes , older than 50 years old . you have to return to construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries who speak another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they demand our prejudices , extend our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we see exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat our themes that get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices Members , who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly associated with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talked about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 came to the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday had given him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationally influenced millions of demonstr@@ ators on a protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma and several questionn@@ aires . &quot;
doctors carried him on this Saturday and have put him in a artificial com@@ a .
his condition is considered critical .
the local portrait Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who quickly spread out in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures also the face of the police officer can recognize that with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service to the conclusion of the examination of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers like he in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his p@@ unch on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be rev@@ oked by a demonstr@@ ator and end up the intensive care station , his face would be six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; shared the video activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , the video activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , which is seen by Lu@@ iz da Luz , which is attacked by the police officer , and several sanitary briefly to him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the indicated clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another State , they now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ anic Re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euro ) , to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow for his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here , the activity of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ app group was murdered only in order to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary school . and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , which has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an , who has pushed him to face with a perc@@ ussion . &quot;
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it happened last Friday to the brutal police officers against prot@@ esters .
&quot; poli@@ cem@@ an in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro where demonstr@@ ators had a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
once again the Brazilian media street prot@@ agon@@ ists have tu@@ cked off the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window &apos;s window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a crum@@ ble glass window to design a picture of its front pages with a picture .
on the other hand the O Glob@@ o is preferred to have a title story with a fire @-@ mounted bus .
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window disk than about the protests of thousands , to report the defence of a special thing . &quot;
&quot; this must also be recognised , if you are strictly against any form of property damage . &quot;
&quot; here also the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is also a absurd , un@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are being scre@@ ened by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ator on confron@@ t@@ ational . &quot; &quot;
the un@@ induc@@ alization forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso with almost hundreds of sugar@@ s in all Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the popular Church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no nen@@ ess sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the car@@ ro@@ hr@@ factories .
&quot; after leaving the sugar cane in the region , the factory was still quiet , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent .
some of the times are the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that still lacks .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , who stands at 4 : 00 hrs in the morning , the crisis in the car@@ ro@@ hr@@ industry not smo@@ ked his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar , they were back in operation after long in@@ active time , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar corro@@ sion has already resist the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago , the message would have been a motive for the country for a few decades , but the bad habit is not new , any more . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ industry turned off ?
the old railway tracks of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabri@@ ken were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the annual report , agricultural and dietary organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would be around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring started in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar production , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar ro@@ hr@@ factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; &quot; scam . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be tac@@ kled .
&quot; so that the place is preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents that were removed only in relation to the parts , which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date of distinction . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could get every discharge . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility were over@@ taken and the letters came more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for those who had put in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another system , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was opposed to his will at the factory of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the industry &apos;s best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important job creation has been eliminated .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ ings and services that were generated in the communities in which they were , created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people who were not able to run , for those areas whose factories were no longer able to run , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , the sugar cane is extracted only high by the single @-@ elections . &quot;

&quot; after two years the popular Church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the car@@ ro@@ hr@@ factory closed , or rather said , when they began to escape them , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ting the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting this other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , had to look N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories . &quot;
they were to share spare parts .
&quot; without the future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even for supplying the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; nine years ago , the old soldiers bring an ox of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a deb@@ atable person , yet he gives the lies that you told him , not . &quot;
they tor@@ ch him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ent , not because it is missing him , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities in the whole of Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them . they do this by using Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been operating directly to schools and youth centres , in order to teach you@@ thful groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were run by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and collabor@@ ated in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will allow the young participants to engage in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , love , love , self acceptance or whatever they come in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people have the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;

the cases were largely ignored .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people have not always master@@ ed the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have taken , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days
that is the day when you get to our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will be able to lift up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; this way , they can grow and run as well as our youth . &quot;
so they can do that which determines the creator of the Creator
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ tion ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic meals are not only shown in Japan
&quot; plastic meals ( F@@ TA ) , outside of a typical restaurants in Japan . &quot;

in Japan one can see nearly every restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly on the menu is located , close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin sandy beach . &quot;
the customers see themselves these plastic meals and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry devoted to producing these plastic meals .
&quot; in the to@@ wering district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies , which produce even those plastic dishes that are documented by the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a , over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic meals are so usual , that they are not even more con@@ stric@@ ted to them . however , a new trend it is now turning into a striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome released the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of Social Media Links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
&quot; now on sale : new with plastic geri@@ atic cell phone belts , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ators magnets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ cking refriger@@ ators magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new bo@@ xing of the f@@ ences will become increasingly expensive .
&quot; in this case , a ca@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular guide with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile phones .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo station in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight to com@@ ic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; are there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I reconcile my mobile with salmon @-@ ro@@ gens ? &quot;
I believe I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic works can also be a less appe@@ ase form to surprise the example of colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone @-@ handed has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and wr@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , who may visit the h@@ ash@@ tag # such . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports in reports in reports and foreign media , in reports of the &quot; &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the distor@@ tion and gear@@ boxes regularly emerge in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug Bosnian as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ on , thrust the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , there is hardly anyone looking at the grape or the churches that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone , behind each bone &apos;s throw in the hundreds of secret tombs , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never be healing . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is calling for the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug trading live &quot; ) &quot; which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories about people who are working in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and therefore whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : how fear life changes &apos; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , one of every weekend secret tombs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost in just one day their father , their four si@@ blings , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew lost . &quot;
&quot; priests : as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task we have asked , go and to graves after the people we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is also here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you stand out the insurance of my Father , but they don &apos;t get paid because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid to face . we must show the international community , the conflicts , dis@@ integration and state of state . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ hip of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central @-@ Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that they should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what shape it occurs : &quot;
disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism I have been known for several years now .
I come over every day of newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures that can only be taken from a textbook for criminals or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only thing that is disgu@@ ised or sad . it acts like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
you are writing further :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year C@@ ousin thinks he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me that is , as if they were dig@@ ging those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that they may have something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the bol@@ ted of 43 students in a neighbor so be justified that they were &quot; &quot; dental vinegar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I think they try to speak out of such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post @-@ four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district : like a family with threats , it was pressed , as armed crime month for month money from their business , until they ended up not only the business but also had their families apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , telephone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these scary days if crying my deep @-@ rooted feelings would dissolve , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ be . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence signed .
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents are concerned about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells that he had to teach yourself how to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the shut@@ ters with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he said that his mother was gone . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had already been over two years earlier , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , who saw bloody suffering from his father , who had been shot by armed men from a squ@@ ad car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder and Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the pro@@ secutor was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just some of the hundreds of thousands of stories that are organised in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories are still living in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched its goal , the complex information behind the struggle against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades in a natural way . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this entry and the pages to which he linked , contain images on which violence is shown . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or or for@@ gery .
&quot; but what about the first time is getting up ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication it was used to use , trage@@ dies on pictures that have occurred actually in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in terminology by Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news . &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 a petrol station passed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ ck@@ led and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s two largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous paths of perc@@ ussion , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , it fell to the victim of the petrol car . &quot;
&quot; administration representatives described a fire@@ ball who described the cleaning houses including a movie near , which was full of people who knew the football world champion . &quot;
houses gro@@ omed and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to un@@ belief .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the previous day form the gray scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of shortened body that are de@@ pra@@ ved on the ground while they look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but rather , not related to trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse charges are in roads and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a population to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were caught , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be illustrated . &quot;
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved but the army @-@ based point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture came from the DR Congo again as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a mass@@ acres of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ br@@ al use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ carriage ; Africa Check has documented acc@@ esses to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ ages . &quot;
yet another step further will bring personal comments like this example the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments .
the picture of San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a Blitz@@ message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee beats , rape and some deaths , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , deaf po@@ sts like the following that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page which in 2012 asser@@ ted that President &apos;s Th@@ ein &apos;s Th@@ ein has been told , monks and politicians had been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo in order to show this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations that AF@@ P referred to as their source , had also failed Th@@ ein being written this statement , but did not allow the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling range dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; one can see how far information can exceed boundaries . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found which the said image from the DR Congo is very similar .
&quot; they come from a mixed @-@ like private sites , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have re@@ directed false reports but others have tried to disp@@ ose the counterf@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; we have linked examples to the mis@@ used use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the listed countries ( which in some cases also associated with each other ) , several examples may be used for abu@@ sive use . &quot;
here some cases which can now be fully restored ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
countries by false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange ranges are still available on sites or servers , over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ cons are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ adata and information , which are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ estation examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; War of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this post a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City is not only the wrong message , but also discussed the misuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the intentions of individuals and the wrapped trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one T@@ we@@ et , the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ erian Mass@@ akers , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger who pursu@@ es the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , because the photos of it were mis@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar / 2017 .
&quot; the government of Myanmar released a trace position to create what they considered &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ ded news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; these cast@@ ers , which appeared exclusively in English , includes references to counterf@@ eit images that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims Buddh@@ ists kill and incar@@ nation ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , presents clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims , to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page was asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein had been involved , that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image from San@@ ge . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and is currently being included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now deleted news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ p attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the image was later moved in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and del@@ etes a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found this event , the mut@@ ation in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
USA , 2015 .
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it have been taken up in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reports in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was supposedly written by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acres , translated the discussion like this here in the Vietnamese and declared it to fal@@ cons . &quot;
&quot; from the message which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye too are no longer trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with URLs and time / date mark exist on the we@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and unified tent , they feature pic@@ dat@@ ors in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , which was first manifested by 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( s ) , who undergo this post . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions concerning the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the proceeds of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how to engage in an African life compared to a European or French life .
&quot; religion is to be understood and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth examining how images in connection with these efforts are being used . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers cannot give this pictures no longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are zig people who have the inno@@ c@@ ence of having the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ se@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decorate it the real atro@@ city of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of massive images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that non @-@ violent pictures readers and audience are des@@ ensi@@ tizing and to take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the examination , how violent media act to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss for@@ esi@@ ght portra@@ yal in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologist experim@@ entation because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thoroughly about situation where a picture can actually be used , which actually can be used by the context or on completely mis@@ ch@@ oral manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false grants should also be taken into account as internationally they can . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ matched ) endeav@@ ours to offer voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : you press certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ matched words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Col@@ so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all contradic@@ ts are stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; if a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected during an online list for quite a while .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the requested language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ h you around your parents in recognition of how you have endeav@@ ored to have taken care of you in your recent years . &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you knew about cold days in the sun .
in Burma &apos;s own words about his blog about :
&quot; they compens@@ ate other cultures , un@@ cover other thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we will analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , they want to publish more these &quot; &quot; un@@ matched &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sing these small languages . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly valued by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wines here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is concerned with the worst fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently seeing the worst high @-@ water and cat@@ astrop@@ hic catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses the river Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing because of the floods and keys . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) , and about 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ all left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the springs in some areas were slowly coming back . &quot;
health and Hygien@@ e@@ ability of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kas deadly killing the Den@@ gue crisis , warns save the Children , after further rainf@@ all are already on the way . &quot;

&quot; the Air Force has provided five planes for life@@ jacket , and other five are finished for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents finished in their flooded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have explained to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka supply important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;

please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 - if animals need help in this field .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ astro@@ oph@@ et centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ crash Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; high water aid &quot; button which allowed users to invo@@ ke a vehicle for pick@@ up of assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free to the s@@ lan@@ dic Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they led a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button that resulted in more than thousands of requests and 150 successful jet@@ ties interactions for the flood of floo@@ ding and cross @-@ dr@@ au@@ ght people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents of need are in need of safety and contribute to help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
&quot; when in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; in the next , we use rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ war@@ ms and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who knows them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Moslems &quot; that has established itself in their conception . &quot;
they arose me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kind of art . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is well designed in our collective imagination such well that once Muslims , which are , as I do not fit out there . &quot;
Muslim will be Muslim
I am not alone with this .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea , religion was deleted , as is the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another man consists in the reduction of Muslim images that Western books have already been con@@ stru@@ ed for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , Edward S@@ aid showed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s . &quot;
but these images continue to stand further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued them to continue . &quot;
&quot; I worked for thirteen years in the news industry , and I &apos;ve seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative our News@@ fe@@ eds dominate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that have led nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from being forced to cover their head@@ s@@ to@@ wel in public buildings and conce@@ al @-@ Arab , Muslim women to cover their entire body that are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exer@@ ts his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the other . &quot;
&quot; this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ened , Muslim women , the movements for change . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American ground by Afri@@ cans who were killed here with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination such a deep and faul@@ ty occupied , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of tim@@ us@@ li@@ ative attacks and ra@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and due to the manner in which we tell them is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
the 1.7 billion are part of the
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree in the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African countries .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my entered parents came to live in New York to live her American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ cian from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents had not f@@ aded Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now called Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some pocket , whom all Muslims carry with him - &quot; out respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
I joke we do not carry all pocket cor@@ es with us .
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen by almost always for additional safety equ@@ es at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who strive to fight widely spread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing band of a well @-@ mi@@ zed Islam@@ ism , thinking and experts for folding information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and due to the manner in which we tell them , Islam@@ ism is more than a stranger who has the head of the head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms takes our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it takes our identity that is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and multi @-@ fac@@ eted , that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;
the author in 1986 on a photo of their children &apos;s gar@@ ment group .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious lives , they attack on the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ative faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , see my neighbor in the fire that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I see them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect themselves which are defeated to the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ ary faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins a I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana Competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother maternal part with her sisters and for decades to win a contest of art of flowers in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their full @-@ finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi home ; and a cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can almost be agile . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be the prayers they told me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a consists in it , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; has been founded , which has established a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging to affili@@ ation means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my assigned grandfather crying . &quot;
&quot; in addition , while he writes books about modern Islam and about independence Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan sh@@ attered around his family in the India of India , who he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to the fact that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like with my grandfather , of coloni@@ alists , who have been gi@@ fted by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the risk of risk . &quot;
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have been &quot; de@@ alized up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first tile bomb was rejected by a century ago about a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , caus@@ al sub@@ ordinate of the British empire , was described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as it led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ incorporated history .
&quot; it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that had gone beyond every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , were divided into Iraq to chase mass destruction weapons , which did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy is da@@ unting and the suspi@@ cious name carries a Muslim name , the history four times more reported than a story with a white assassination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that there was four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a friend black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad is ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this land .
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X means a American hero .
it is the warmth I sen@@ sing as people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and if we say black life .
&quot; an American one , a pa@@ edia , a pa@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a journalist , a Muslim , a journalist , a Muslim and a journalist , which means in@@ dur@@ ated inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple bin@@ o@@ cular identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a mother means to be a mother to worry about my child , and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this du@@ alism build structural awareness . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam @-@ sensitivity consists in the Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in a consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who took a five year old child in hand .
it consists in a country which closes its limits towards people from precisely the countries that it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &apos; no @-@ Fly list that largely Arabs and Muslims take into account .
these are the wars that we lead and the bombs which we throw on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and due to which we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and b@@ aking them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on the evolution of evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply moved , the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image printers that we are ste@@ aling in our news .
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to grasp our many identi@@ ties and for@@ ti@@ ring history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast Sea ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Muslim ; the vir@@ g@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ licity , Muslim writers , and Ms Mar@@ vel , Pakistan , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
&quot; later , screen@@ shots of media initiatives who want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ ality of muscular American life . &quot;
col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am concerned with this difficult global time , in which we are . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for that conspir@@ acies that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslims to others .
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a few years before they had not yet given it ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of , as I was old , but that today is my daughter , but that today &apos;s a sh@@ ame@@ ful Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things I left here like a Br@@ ot@@ kr@@ ec@@ umen@@ ical track in my speech .
&quot; things that may wake memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that constitutes our humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley please take place in the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell the question here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are managed and people were involved through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago the scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to imagine ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; to solidi@@ fy the &apos; other &apos; ; as it is a new future that we have no president , while he already cap@@ tives countries and &apos; to other made people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives want to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story tennis , of Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity here and now despite a language barrier to someone in connection ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , is the experience of stories in its original language a possible response to it . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices reported recently on another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ over@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written one , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the creators of the project are :
&quot; the massage of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , the diversity of diversity , in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; &quot; while listening is often associated with it , understand &quot; &quot; for purposes of this events instead &quot; &quot; listening to the list@@ ener to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , you will present their story at first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , they perform their dedication and representation to ensure that the audi@@ ble would turn on it . &quot;
they call for laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , who is told in the language d@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain typical customs of narr@@ atives for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ uss from the hare and the b@@ ang in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his wood , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ch he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were very with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS , to organize their own stories of history . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ traction of the state debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars ; the Mar@@ sh started at the Classi@@ cal Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old City of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was called by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a . &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ ons of debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian church meeting in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the new debt also have submitted an Peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls for the politicians , peasants and government agencies who are responsible for debts to take responsibility for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial examination and a gui@@ deline without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , according to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will forgive and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refused to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not to the state @-@ state integrated territory of the USA - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a government non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state of state . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , actions imposed on the participation and conviction of the citizens are danger to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration took the name &quot; neighbour watch for light and truth . &quot;

&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie de Ros@@ nay , a scientist in the France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publisher of the books produced by so called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ hing excerpts from the book Cost : a Collec@@ tive In@@ dies ( The cost of freedom : a collective post@@ research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss , such as movements for free knowledge , and what the real cost is associated with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have to look at the fog which surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of A@@ dra @-@ prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its present state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release , and who want to know him in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have started to reflect on their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of timeless extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ Develop@@ er for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strict secret command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that they had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented himself as an in@@ sider of the Assad &apos;s government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death struggle against their husband .
its location and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes fores@@ een was the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras virtu@@ el .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , the sign@@ ment of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ cal traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , not just the cultural heritage of Syrians but the world em@@ bodied . &quot;
this strip @-@ train into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a tim@@ eline which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable importance .
&quot; so far , Bas@@ sel could not complete this project so far . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life , from freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English with even when he was in prison .
I learned to read English well and speak English .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with every one that asked . he taught others , to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet at the same time .
&quot; he also taught others as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually kept one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of orph@@ an ( waiting ) , a proxy which she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together for a year on the book .
&quot; she comp@@ lied the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he translated her out of the Syrian Arab . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .
book set by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it is happening at every visit .
&quot; that I failed in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose better at the moment in which we embrace , &quot;
that I don &apos;t care any of the dangers
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , bonds and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the memorial of the prison
&quot; and I , in every detail of your voice and words , &quot;
who I carry with passion for me
when your eyes may well say
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to get back all the moments
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I testify myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; one year away , my soul &quot;
during the course of
I am in your cage
and you are still in the cheese of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syri@@ ac Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or under violence by the regime disappeared , were tor@@ tured , or even executed . &quot;
&quot; until 2016 , since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption condemned director of his trial back to previous post
&quot; Mos@@ ambi@@ ans reacted to a corruption incident , in which a government member returned to the workplace of the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this was arrested by Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 with four other def@@ endants because of 54 million meth@@ tics ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) was sentenced to 22 years in prison . &quot;
the money was from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 stood .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance , and immediately called his re @-@ setting into the company , which was then on 19th April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General State @-@ General of the Republic , which claims the request , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ ba@@ za , back to his old post , because the company did not perform a discipl@@ in@@ arity after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , briefly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , sentenced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company , to establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , the lack of transparency and is even a back@@ stage with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the in@@ consist@@ encies .
&quot; however , the company sch@@ wie@@ g apparently seems and causes no appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case to be contradic@@ tory &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and left half of them . &quot;
he could maintain lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches he could advise and be advice on his image police .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become re@@ integrated into the company that he helped cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for its silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student in Brazil , says the director , no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he ob@@ ased him , I can &apos;t believe someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ craft in order to become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself has become tired , who pre@@ charged and eventually was sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
honestly I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded so rewarded .
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only for the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - next door - the prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for his ambitions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . it changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious man is simultaneously criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also declining :
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat over 10 years and came free . &quot;
and today it sets him the company in which he inv@@ ent money back again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ zi@@ pper ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they included the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people east of India &apos;s origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or at the same time as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of the rise of radical movements of the word has given an extremely ab@@ rupt con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is usually used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate language in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensual content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may normally be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically call upon hate language . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts as expressed for his use , have been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ical words with the fundamental different meanings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ isch also is written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( &apos; cam@@ el b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on spiritual art , whether she knew how he might rel@@ ieve his back pain , that he made a word . &quot;
&quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the racial expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win H@@ ad , the opinion that she &apos;s hate speech is going to decrease radical nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook will have to be more analytical , before it &apos;s all po@@ sts who spread in suspi@@ cion of suspi@@ cion . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write on fac@@ et .
what it should do is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( spi@@ der ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread , the hate language , has received quite a good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to circumc@@ ised its nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all of them , the hate language may be spread , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often will start a K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby users use social networks to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ or word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to delete his post , when he only talked to his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ex@@ iled from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my postal mail was removed from Facebook and was forbidden to do the light , posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post office does not speak the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show off their opinions against hate talking radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform but so it doesn &apos;t work .
such words will only cause more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and so called &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Cre@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the mis@@ er@@ un@@ solved po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which make them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has made a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously take users about Facebook fun and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net .
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts who did not play a hate language , but they were still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ ds@@ y and watch an Indian film .

&quot; over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have increased social networks to increase their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate language in social networks should also mar@@ vel the violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Moslems and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook became for his failure to talk the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating of hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have been better on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanimously a law that is to ban this practice so that the free age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the marriage law , some members held out in practice , and in May 2016 , there came to a great public cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country had gathered , that the state did not interfere with sol@@ itude , since that , age , not maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Human Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who stayed with 15 already married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were eager to aver@@ t laws on the children &apos;s age , followed on the foot and pleasing of great support . no doubt they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du guide , B. did not have any concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , be condemned for their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point , doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the law was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained himself in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would have taken him to the law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law . &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook an status update , which read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the legis@@ lature &apos;s throw against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this , and no single against it . &quot;
&quot; after having decided before in the Senate , the design can now become the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were thrilled because the laws were finally changed to children &apos;s notice .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who dressed a minister in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary righteous , used to wear the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago and this is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; during A@@ bel Jackson of opinion , it was definitely long enough to escape the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas persu@@ aded that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Her@@ vor@@ ed News ! &quot;
the marriage Act has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted : &quot;
&quot; the holi@@ d@@ ative age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religion , 18 years . &quot;
&quot; the draft for the change of the marriage Act has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and were present 35 during the vote .
&quot; all members who were opposed , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # L@@ aces F@@ athers .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan E@@ vil Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take court steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to resolve his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general state @-@ state Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , argued , unless Mahar@@ aj is intended against the law , the most social media users , you would like to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of speaking the discussion so broadly , that the state , our daughters should give rise to them , in a way that they may be mis@@ used by the problem , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ hard men who may be ab@@ used to them , would you be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they have signed . &quot;

&quot; for more than one month , Turkey has become popular and based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day becomes more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful as well as reliable information . &quot;
both students and journalists and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against the block@@ ages .
&quot; although many techniques @-@ sealed Internet users are used to use re@@ traction tools for blocking web pages ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been released from Wikipedia , as recently published in an published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , has been adopted regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) . &quot;
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform submitted all Turkish Wikipedia pages to its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( thus calcul@@ ating computer compounds ) which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus a complete cens@@ orship is difficult .
&quot; however , the content is subject to legal prohibition but also available . &quot;
in a blo@@ post post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; once we have heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to disable sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and processed mode . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ osk a.@@ org itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS was also given that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots , and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to cope with the sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ arding similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides , when in the respective country is locked , brought forth . &quot;

&quot; there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mir@@ rors . &quot;
one acc@@ esses another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; in essence , the server guides the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey . &quot;

&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar strives to bring Nep@@ ar to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and its home location next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that attract the attention to Nep@@ alese wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this class situation helps at his job :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called . he had a call from my father received that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; immediately , I was running with my camera and was there in a few minutes . &quot;
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar strives to achieve cooperation with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look .
and he should know it because he was standing tigers already from face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was coming home because of the darkness at home , when suddenly the king of the bow appeared . he immediately sets up , we see ourselves and he faces me through the s@@ al trees ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist resorts . &quot;
look at the bottom of some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az the wal@@ a , and originally published on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India there are women with great care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard this practice to life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a shot and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relatives . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also did not name their wives to name , is also widely used under men . however , they have far less access to fear , if at all , if any , they should not fail . &quot;
&quot; in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , became a unique club and were therefore quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that gives it in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to un@@ covering practices , such as children &apos;s council up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs . &quot;
&quot; it tells you about how these clubs created a safe place for these women , and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ ter@@ ies of change . &quot;
&quot; the first video that showed the Roh@@ ini in its discussion , acted by women who call their hus@@ bands not to name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this subject because she wanted a conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that the women can easily identify with .
&quot; not to speak the name of their hus@@ bands , is a Br@@ auch , which is maintained all guilty and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is considered as a l@@ isti@@ g when a woman without morality .
tradition is rooted so deeply rooted that we have never thought about up to this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband before , at home , try out at home , as it runs at home . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law , and my husband had l@@ acked a long time after the video was at the end . &quot;
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should tell him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the lap Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video project , women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of their husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the brake of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which women married the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that over the whole exercise only burned down in the whole exercise ; another decided to let the whole up@@ take care against him and his family by hiding him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in adren@@ alin , even in adren@@ alin , in adren@@ alin , to have broken br@@ aces , the women decided that they were actually trying at home to call their hus@@ bands when they were called . &quot;
and they kept her word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women into his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another small member chose to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she asc@@ ended , she got fear and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I will do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in less understanding and the situation ar@@ ded in violence .
&quot; reported as women reported , as women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing of the interest no@@ ber@@ red spot on the forehead , which indicates the adul@@ ter@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he was also active . &quot;
he just lau@@ ghed only and I heard to carry him out .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but they are now in a better position to choose themselves , in some days not to bear . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and s@@ add@@ led about things that they had never done before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties have made to our hus@@ bands , never to be honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things according to saying , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to your clothes .
some women in the group have taken only Sar@@ is in the group since their marriage .
&quot; for most is that okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt over a tro@@ user ; they did not trust themselves . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes elections , morality joined with the sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ i@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
the question about whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something that things are slowly coming into the roles :
we have taken only little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened again to saying the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now contribute to Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the l@@ eli@@ ght to get more freedom of movement or their own hang@@ ers - at the end of a hard drive to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; giving them self confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman is going home in the club to other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beatles in their land in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
&quot; on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was held at the Japanese Twitter trend in which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles . &quot;
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered to be a turn @-@ turn in Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ ia , who noted the Beatles , 1964 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beatles was in the country , but this has been damaged to leave the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; the people here has become clear quite quickly , that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms . &quot;
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith than the Beatles in 1966 came to Japan for the first time .
&quot; the music of the Kul@@ t@@ band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retail division Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the Online @-@ Magazine Nik@@ ola Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today , the Beatles commem@@ oration is in Japan . at the end of the year 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese SMEs . &quot;
the Kit@@ ch of The Beatles also survived everything .
today The Beatles &apos;s Memorial Day is today .
we all love the Beatles in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; -@@ Pu@@ ppe John Lenn@@ on should be present or not .
&quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well known places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) Pen@@ ny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( V@@ om Link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges are sometimes not able to be sk@@ ri@@ le enough :
good morning together .
today The Beatles &apos;s Memorial Day is today .
this was the first time in 1966 in 1966 .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and went on Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
&quot; and of course some companies use the fan@@ base too , as for example this r@@ ame @-@ shop ( rats are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could be that for a day ?
I will listen to me today &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; and have dinner at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day is going to happen today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ tizen under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) new responses to the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ d and Dis@@ si@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made only recently . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the Ar@@ med Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer at the end of June , he had been delivered to hospital for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state dangerous ) after the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which the democratic reforms in China had been involved . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and told a speaker , he did not understand it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow for treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely out of the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure on licensing Li@@ u abroad for a treatment . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ush have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to the shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government claimed that this will be nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon farms to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after finding the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel committee brought his hope of unconditional release and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was not able to take up his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u became represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest , and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also called for the release of Li@@ us as described in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they are to meet all the visits and receive them , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA the USA
&quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans would have the opportunity for treatment abroad , in this respect they helped him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 , that the message received the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call for the US Embassy was an angry response from China to himself , with the exterior of the foreign affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protecting and freedom , such as travel , free movement and access to the medical care of its choice , based on them according to Chinese constitution and judicial system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p / / bitter / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany Germany
&quot; the German government of Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; is &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news Agency Re@@ uters , that China had big concerns , whether the vor@@ ti@@ bel around Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by visiting Li@@ u the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada in Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um China asked to provide appropriate medical care to us and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it &apos;s not permitted with someone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;
McC@@ all@@ um tells us on :
&quot; Canada calls on China to release its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to maintain right and for the exercise of these rights inser@@ ting . &quot;
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in an explanation on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless where , requires . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news item France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign announced that there is no further information , if France would be able to resume it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the festive agricultural affairs in Taiwan called for China on June 27 , on June 27 , release a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese Legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , called for China , also called upon to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to let themselves treat in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama was very concerned in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and gave many him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives which he took and for which he was severely punished to harmon@@ ise , stabili@@ zing and wealthy China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be regarded as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of New York , the minister of New York commented that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore , since Singapore was compared with other countries . &quot;
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether new York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing , to create this valuable country , you hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the impression of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , then country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the topic once again the good old cor@@ er from the author@@ itarian makers will leave , leave the tw@@ isted logic , since they fit their power better . &quot;
&quot; in the final effect , those in the last week of Shan@@ gh@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ answers rational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which land belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our worth of K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take up this issue as long as it was paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by clicking on his comment on his blog , he pointed out about the critics that they should begin to read the entire part of the conference , so that the Singapore would be better understood by the statements of Shan@@ gh@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore would be a city , and no country . &quot;
read the comments .
&quot; as he said that Singapore was more like a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equ@@ itable , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he studied Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is a leader in a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very much ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I agree - be with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ gh@@ g@@ am , Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes , really associated it and be aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review presents the weaknesses of Shan@@ gh@@ g@@ ams :
&quot; did Mr Shan@@ gh@@ g@@ am committed an error &quot; , &quot; or was it a bol@@ d@@ scher betra@@ yal ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gh@@ g@@ am are of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singapore authorities afford their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizen of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this proposition seems to have been anno@@ yed a lot of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice c@@ adi@@ ers &quot;

scre@@ enshot of a YouTube video .
Global Vo@@ ices asked short its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours over certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the issue in which situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite to show interest in his conversation by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fying position then mostly follows the default answer : &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans are perhaps in@@ wardly in anger before anger , if they are held to Americans but don &apos;t bother me that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans become a Canadian flag clearly visible to their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other ...
&quot; it was that way , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , prior to the invasion of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small m@@ ap@@ le sheets at their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
equal marriages in Canada have been legal since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also said to be the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends who I highly admired . &quot;
it would be nothing if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : as a &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be described , is basically to be sp@@ ill - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic , un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; harmless , means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from the things that happen around one around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to , say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; described as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; , &quot; maybe just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness , which I have now been connecting with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; kind . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video which took the power of the Jun@@ ta which took power and restore the civil government despite her ple@@ dge to restore the civil government , continue to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells us what rules he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the song about the song was an amazing success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , particularly as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta @-@ rule . &quot;
looking at once these recordings of the video look at some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ secuted over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the He@@ aler absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setup change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against , whose v@@ ague and clear regulations are often used by authorities to uni@@ fy activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , the online content monitors and persons , who pre @-@ cast the monarchy , will be pro@@ secuted , pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict set against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ ority ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was launched in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be pro@@ secuted , is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ marine , even though safety per@@ ple@@ ts they war@@ med that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video is even shown , how people will be cast into a black delivery car before they bring them into an interfer@@ ing camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and on Internet users are threatening for long periods , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the band members of the band , who were using the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated already during the protests of 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ Asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website by OC Media and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian war has been officially ended , but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chi@@ ava are situated in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , off @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans , Geor@@ gi@@ ans , and Armen@@ ians , and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians are living and har@@ n@@ oses in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
&quot; in the early years , there are still more than 10,000 people today , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people had hardly risen over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all of this is a consequence of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story residential @-@ story of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ Ã¬@@ kov@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is still unique . &quot;
in front of war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with remaining splendor @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where laundry dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother allowed us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pering her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee @-@ keeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; the District administration provides for free candles , and bread to the villages in winter . &quot;

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago there was an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jung@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial support from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she has supported her young grandchildren instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
aun@@ ching G@@ alya tells you that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and holidays to celebrate .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; you said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
&quot; together with her husband and the five common children , he lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she is reminded of the village &apos;s village before war .
&quot; despite the relatives that live in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ sia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( ste@@ t@@ aup@@ t@@ town in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something , &quot; it is explained . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives for every child about $ 9 children .
her husband works in the coal leng@@ thier .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; she tells us that there was a very scary situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has to do something with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation tends to the end , a little boy passed on to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies from the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball who down the hills .
a group of children now write the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the falling buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for im@@ min@@ ent in their lives .
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico it houses &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article from Amy Br@@ ing was published on 19 April 2017 , on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be released here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 5@@ 9@@ - year Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ erin , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ gest@@ ell and gol@@ d@@ colored ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form .
she is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was raised there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . yet they know many of the name M@@ om Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they ) have become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with separate , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and hairy migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
it does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines which they cannot pay , they mask them with a bal@@ sam that of the long journey exhaustive f@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is just a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ beard ) with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ing .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to it , since African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find out there her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil for some Afri@@ cans , who are on their way to the United States , to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other leaders of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel the way together and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and has worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa &apos;s guest for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the bus ticket .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests are sending her many times news when they went , to kiss her or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , there is a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
this winter was added to Valen@@ ela and his family migrants in their small house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ er outside . &quot;
&quot; Valen@@ ela explains , that he knows what the guests are doing through . &quot;
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was taken out after a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to get money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single one , has offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family is still living there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers quiet their phones .
&quot; a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large proportion from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she is in her album with many photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ dres@@ sers you made a customer in , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travellers more , young and old . &quot;
she laughs sad while she briefly presents me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated them every time . &quot; you already have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ Point for personal communication tools in X@@ inj@@ ang , from Twitter users , who are working on board . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone notification in which it indicates the District government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities then use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they were shortly after they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private mobile chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app stood to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and pursue , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphy web sites , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan@@ ers and ph@@ ishing sides to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control your home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors shall help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; &quot; government actors or even h@@ ackers might be@@ g the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while talking about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities of the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , forced ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit turmoil and dissatisfaction in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ al Internet circuits . &quot;
&quot; this was published on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &apos; images from Main@@ land China . , the cens@@ ored news in China published , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the poli@@ cem@@ an , on the poli@@ cem@@ an , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian represent certain that the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is hin@@ dered his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and stell@@ ate that you are all alone in one place where everything is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved , gradually and a truth reveals , which is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes the name all honour .
one that has turned into a list of feelings and ex@@ cre@@ ds that have no metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get back the reality and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters are transformed into being of meat and blood , and all shou@@ ted to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth is trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them have built your grandparents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but there was not yet to say &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the safety service , it was formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he set his power over us that he even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped during a peaceful prot@@ tests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it ran@@ ged to the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Wr@@ ite .
&quot; all the districts of the district , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands placed on a city that is op@@ ting to the arteries with state safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce . &quot;
in the third night things had cal@@ med things to work after the power supply in the quarter to work .
&quot; I passed the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; by my house . &quot;
I heard my voice off the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we told us to a beautiful image that filled my expectations full and completely fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you &apos;re free the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not get you in the straight line . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with military security . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice after you got it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body .
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s hear me , just like you &apos; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his light @-@ filled eyes set up on me .
&quot; and you are sad to look , to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause , when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I believe I have never ceased to look to you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in single , and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equally with it . &quot;
the pi@@ erc@@ ing of this war@@ ped proposition lies me up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; of a spiritual torture , which I was subjected to monthly . &quot;
I shou@@ ted the farm .
in the first office I leave everything back I am using .
then again through the farm and into the second office which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I pre@@ fers all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have probably been using a larger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoners and may immediately sit down without having to wait for her permission .
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ proven communication method : with Faust against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned , that my cell @-@ paper was a &quot; &quot; black@@ smith &apos;s prisoner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells lay in no middle aged man , who is similar to me and is called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness can be seen at me no mark@@ ers , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers are one of its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the major cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would leave him if I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; if I would like to have a bird @-@ sh@@ an@@ che , in order to exp@@ el all these cro@@ wing who lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear it &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always at these time , the cry of the cry , each day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the destruction , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ad in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; , &quot; play on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; to protect the secret : to protect the state security before us , and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al availability card and en@@ rie@@ ve the close eye field of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , that is not a land here ; it is a curse to call the co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their sound into a mighty man . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the inter@@ rog@@ ation and tre@@ ach on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; despite the facial expressions , which hal@@ es him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life as you join these diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I used to get accustomed to , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer say when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become an ordinary communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me told me to be punished to be punished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which is probably native to the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker takes us to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry fell not enough , so that they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; when I first asked , I asked if the investig@@ ators had been working as a trash collection or whether that belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ woven to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cab@@ al . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them rarely happen , while I was still in line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I heard heard . &quot;
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and found no favour at all because he was next to a electri@@ cally invited drive .
flow only my entire body to supply my whole neighborhood .
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was spread on the ground , was the perfect black@@ out . &quot;
num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say this was my only option .
some hours passed me like minutes before .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaustive young girl : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be scary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and go away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they guide me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ al R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the majority of his time inside ; times he lo@@ wers his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what you can rely on , is a cigarette between its fingers , or its with nicotine berries , to discover the lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives on the top of his family house , which had heard them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had to escape from her village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who introduces itself to the conservative majority and to ask their old @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , who often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestine , he also calls for all these issues not only in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as a person who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries , and can have to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not give it open to U.S. foreign policy , he triumph@@ s against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas , to survive anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian de@@ ton@@ ous of the second generation &quot; - he describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sho@@ ok in water , Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in this time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ant law also states that public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for this to break with ur@@ old traditions ; on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ite hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the slots speak warm coffee and the s@@ wa@@ der of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as to drink water during the Ramad@@ an of water - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens had a appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some Parliam@@ entary MPs , who support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ man in the Islamic Coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was said &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also say , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which constitutes the un@@ approved legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimates the j@@ ord@@ ant people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continues to be decided on an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may probably not be easy @-@ to @-@ sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually reflected a more and more evident reality in Jordan , which appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards come to Lei@@ be by carrying out his vision of the fate of Arab women who have for@@ esh@@ ado@@ wed sex . &quot;
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently l@@ apped woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
in the past years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ als &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als in 2016 reached its culmin@@ ation ; however , Jordan has not yet reached that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support the victims such as murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law of crime against the year 1954 women , who are exposed to the danger of inner violence , and for their release is often an years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity , and is known also not to withdraw issues which in his country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , does however , that he is his music , which is full of explicit att@@ achments to sexuality , freedom and expression , not separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; for me , politics was pro@@ secuted , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; hits the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus again on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get , in his words , &quot; which you want &quot; &quot; is it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were torn out of the context and had been cens@@ ored by his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which is still alive today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks yourself : when Abu Nu@@ what is to work later on behalf of the potassium , in the eighth century was able to write about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government &apos;s government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ ant Intelligence took a number of former governmental members and members of the curriculum firm , with the reason they had expressed themselves in social media critical about the problems that are deeply rooted in the country with deep roots . &quot;
&quot; given the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , in view , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been a constant and taking place for him . Jordan has mel@@ ted Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is going to be filled with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , sc@@ amm@@ uni@@ tion and artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it has been done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue on and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one thought that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the for@@ ks , the drums and the tan@@ ces are mar@@ ched over more than one thousand years , in the armies of Japan in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knee . &quot;
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a super view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a communal center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at me again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival the only truth - and to spend an amazing way of spending his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meters high feast was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , outer appearance and body care are as important as in this history , because they help promote the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate job as to the hair@@ line . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , located near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street ro@@ b and illegal drug trading are daily . &quot;
one in April 2017 published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts come up with each other to show who can create the most ex@@ centric L@@ ooks to see how to see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests at the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people of getting their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor advice to get a training in the hair@@ style art , which allows them to find work . &quot;

Colombia : love letters to guer@@ rilla fighters

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; Liebes@@ message to guer@@ rilla fighters &quot; , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel extinct ? &quot;
exactly this question went the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bogot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation Bogot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation Bogot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation Bogot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a .
&quot; only recently , her country venue was a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace agreement was as significant as the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; but in front of the Colom@@ bian , however , there is a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; the guer@@ rilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and around the clock have to integrate their weapons back to life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society again , which had used to live in constant fear and in some cases a deeper hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , it has to record its ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ist would be together and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guer@@ rilla fighters in order to welcome them again in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ rilla fighters who are then to be transferred personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation arose in the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there had Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he is planning , he told us on this year his love with people who needed the most urgent support . &quot;
&quot; to write the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to establish a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to be a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I have never thought , that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were passed on March 19 in one of the UN warehouse in the Cal@@ don@@ o region of Cal@@ don@@ o .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Management of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC did so on how they had done before to counter the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands but letters full of under@@ tak@@ ings of people from all over the country .
&quot; it was a very movable moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything , which lies in between &quot; &quot; told the political scientific student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , it led me a former fighter through the camp of Guer@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ rilla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ rilla fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear to go down , because besides him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ er , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ n ro@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; I said nevertheless to him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone wrote me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I rep@@ lied with the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ e@@ ets .
&quot; maybe he was pity the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the loyal companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . I had never thought that someone would forgive him for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there that awaits us with open arms .
until now I &apos;ve only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to start @-@ up , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students had all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
&quot; for that reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles &quot; , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; to hear these people who had never been heard before and had no voting right , and to realize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings are surrounded by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the land lives , I hur@@ ried . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us something and can give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was prophes@@ ied that after the dra@@ in@@ age peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are ready to attack arms and to protest for their rights . and this is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we are now putting the F@@ ARC to peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call on all the defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know of our own experience , that nothing is easy . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the reporting of the last few months about the persecution of men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends as a dam compl@@ ained about the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not first created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us , which currently has happened in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published , who have been published the wear , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen Auth@@ orities who suspected que@@ er men and put them in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since their childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when they grow , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya from the gender equality of their country@@ men , hunting was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
they were very afraid of her life in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which appeared in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then , there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ app . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was here , a few shopping st@@ aves from the return seat of my car , I heard a men say , &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you pe@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man who was not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two key@@ boards in my right p@@ oul@@ try . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which hospitals , you were laid - in the men or women of the women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , since it is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and laid me with the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it to do with fear ; it was a muscle , a k@@ au@@ kas@@ ischer name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family has been visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the slo@@ gans to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some told me , I must prove it , that I had not changed in the official television in Gros@@ ny , and say I did not change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have KÃ¶r@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for her .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a fro@@ g woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later it was under the window a car with dark window cu@@ dd@@ les and a number@@ mer@@ n@@ schild with a 95 dr@@ auf .
&quot; after it happened to the third time , I realized that there was something lazy . &quot;
my human right @-@ friends over@@ l@@ apped the num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was per@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you go ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I want to do their names , but I will say that I will remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something in@@ credible . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without having to register , without notice , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which Hotel du st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality . however , this is a topic of tobacco . &quot;
some traditionally k@@ au@@ kas@@ hen@@ ian elements I still carry in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we ch@@ atting with camera , I actually give myself trouble how to see the person they remember from their past - so in my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has saved a and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramad@@ an , no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait and he closed a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now concentrating on family and relatives .
&quot; with that , my I , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood satisfaction has experienced . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret cases ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives , to place Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be present as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be brought forth to show off their bodies and pre@@ tend , they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but sub@@ merged in order to become radical . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was in Ar@@ gun one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply have them taken .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were killed . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as a banker , so far there were no reports . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why otherwise you would not have allowed this man to shave ?
&quot; know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have always been doing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I believe , already in 2003 I already lived in Great Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil cul@@ arization &quot; , &quot; but ultimately came back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were made ; I had colored eyelashes , carried out tube @-@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops . &quot;
the safety of Sh@@ aria has never even curved only a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place , where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been wasted .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
they often say to children if they make funny about crane .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes in front of you , because they believed , you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never sinned , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten . &quot;
OC Media : how long has this Gn@@ ad@@ ment time held ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister 2005 , he began to speak on television on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but rather on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless - one could feel , how the people in the city started to change . &quot;
&quot; who had settled in advance and had eight , looked at once with suspi@@ cion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly swal@@ lowed out . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you now go after ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I still am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , gathering , I beg@@ ining them to the hospital and help them to get ess@@ ays . &quot;
I do not break a penny for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I swal@@ low it .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ from ?
Sab@@ rina : this is Algeri@@ an .
&quot; so , nature is absolutely nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam before the mouth , that there are no g@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have , which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , which ; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I have so many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque , and during the Ramad@@ an - live with men together . &quot;
&quot; know you , many think in transi@@ tions of men who love men , and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a dec@@ eption . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation , to be accurate , different way of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I am sorry that I become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad about it - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ moral . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the dou@@ bt@@ ful situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi Community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of Iran in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety and depression , depression , and sh@@ ame@@ ful for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that may work in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube , video held the moments after he had sm@@ ashed himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the combustion were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists warn against it that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have to have it . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : there were all family ancestors , who were helpl@@ ess on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and go to a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ mad community lived has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny the local Arab population to dispute its liveli@@ hood .
&quot; in front of a century ago the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most sought @-@ to @-@ use and most valuable plac@@ ements for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of d@@ bes , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie , embr@@ aced . &quot;
these dam@@ s have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation devast@@ ated in the region and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi te@@ ens rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have a job completed , 55 % a further @-@ leading school finished and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said , Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new ethnic Per@@ sians , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since functional and institutions preferred not to Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will disp@@ ose of access to working opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their liveli@@ hoods outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their suburbs and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ mad@@ azi and so to be placed as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the statement , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . this article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women respond - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a great deal of scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist * should be .
&quot; for example , that women nowadays still earn less money today than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women occur sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still going through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced of it and I can handle twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to talk about skin @-@ color , on what type we had to suffer in black and black women , on what type we have been physically , mentally and verb@@ ati@@ sts , go to black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women , on which type we are physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , decide to keep many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing their voices and sing &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institu@@ tion@@ alized form of racial violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin , are less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girl and girls with a migration background more often the school is referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk , exposed to domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men , all men , and all men of all human color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman , who refuse to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in their thinking that relate both to the gender and the skin colour of one person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women ever and again .
&quot; soccer 1851 in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also refused to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is in historical respect a human@@ ly and margin@@ alised being . &quot;
I so@@ ak myself to join myself group@@ ings which also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ centric agenda .
&quot; I will no longer try to create white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to honor the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different herds into a home and to prevent themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I draw it before , me and totally em@@ ulate the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , rather than to use me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born as a novel phenomenon is celebrated . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we can define black women after our own ideas and embark on us into the spheres which we are created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson We@@ ems says that we can defend ourselves on our own way . not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I &apos;m existing . &quot;
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life does not exist , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ del@@ usion against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports special about international efforts to solve environmental issues . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the region Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we are following Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust lam@@ bs , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # consecr@@ ate women ) who reported about the violence of women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons concerned .
&quot; a police commander said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she has nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become active against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship was some time passed and the police said , their statement would be placed among the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as a further Mrs. Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to Mis@@ sions , also the acute display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
some days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are issued at all times , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also subject to financially dependent on the men they do . this explains why only 20 % of women who admit to be victims of violence at all , to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 beats and Statisti@@ cs 2 inv@@ itations and a legal system , which is nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ able laws : good approach , lack of realization beats and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are truly wei@@ ghed at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a Social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even accum@@ ulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , at the District state @-@ state , 9@@ 600 ads were on domestic violence . at 70 % of it , there was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence against peace . also here are 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women , that they were physically opposed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s minister in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic distr@@ action , come 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman , which will be reimbur@@ sed because of physical abuse display , come two women who do not do this , &quot; concluded by the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay have no own crimes , the law enforcement authorities can not be adequately documented how many women killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
only until August 2016 included journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country alone .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay the ten days dies a woman due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that does not take anything
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called his name for him all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she did not want it , but then after . this should always regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years she carried out the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable the most severe . &quot;
I have never thought that I would once become victims of distr@@ action .
&quot; when I &apos;ve read earlier about it , I always thought that only women are happening to di@@ vul@@ ge because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which they described their insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had ins@@ isted it . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for such a long time and left him not earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say , that the victims of Mis@@ sions were at least a certain fellow to blame . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they are doing . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all in some way victims of Mis@@ sions .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as Fall everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; her prosperous partner , after all , managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads remained at the authorities without a result and also of their relatives , she did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ memorial legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of Mis@@ sions is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ She ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original dra@@ wer of the law considers fem@@ ini@@ d to explain and harder to be explained and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in some points , the legal text was altered in some points to also win the MEPs in some points that is the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently forbidden in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was intended to bear the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which the victims of violence at present themselves have to carry out , if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legis@@ lature does not provide sufficient financial resources for this : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , distr@@ action is seen as part of human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer considered to be seen . &quot;
&quot; who in the face of these facts has been deb@@ ated , and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are crossed . &quot;
we have to refund for such a long time until distr@@ action is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law have been altered . among other things , a passage that was forced into cases of domestic violence against reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes proceed apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; the dispute of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; in parts of the law applies as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to be exposed to attacks by a newspaper following a newspaper
&quot; this website was locked to read on the homepage of the rejected newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on the homepage of the rejected newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to its coverage about corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he was a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to judgment later , but later were free . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man is governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he came to his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; since then , he dressed , alongside his role as the sole Sultan , the most important ministries in the country : Prime Minister , Secretary Minister , Secretary of Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , especially the domestic trade , public freedom , including press freedom , to restrict and prevent human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to be shy and de@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and prevent citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces , Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , after the title of &quot; high @-@ ranking parties , &quot; was released for corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court in O@@ man , to raise a judgment in a inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Num@@ er@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board Committee , loaded from the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested with his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS Deputy Chief of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j took place after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is who acts as a che@@ at player .
&quot; the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the Minister of the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison quarters and also concluded the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j , both among others , were condemned by disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience message and the s@@ lan@@ der for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of sti@@ ckers and cash prizes in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after completing the use of a information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit was fixed at the amount of 5000 000 dollars ( 13 000 dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gment . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ al spoke Al @-@ Abr@@ i , in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was arrested on 10 April 2017 after the imprisonment of his six month prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he sentence his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ al also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again permit , the newspaper considers itself to be exposed by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information held a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; has been extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister for the Minister personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months , and with what the ministers asked for another time against the decision of the appeal , which made the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man last time the press freedom was injured .
&quot; for further violations , for example the closure of the website of the independent magazine of Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , set up the first independent online newspaper of the country to set its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not prepared to prepare an end to the comprehensive injury of the press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights ; G@@ CH@@ R ) is demanding the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j as immediate and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can go back to their work ;
3 . protect freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man are un@@ obstruc@@ ted out of their ri@@ ghtful human rights , and without fear of inter@@ changeable measures , including in judicial ship . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of unification , as well as the right to develop peace@@ fully , support and protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent . &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for local medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack in the supply of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that cover special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have widespread impact than elsewhere , and lack investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of centr@@ all@@ ors at the Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , precisely when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself researched at HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
Global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment is the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for Anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started developing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current research themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; it must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers , instead of being both makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get , are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people that want to come back or prefer , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research that you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and creating access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed manufacturers will change global food production
&quot; this article of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , as for example out@@ editor , the first plant , which was cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ aut and consumed . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only set by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ aries can get , limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads have been patented , and that he could not continue to use them for . &quot;
&quot; the patents not only for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more and more such patents have always been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . due to this trends , plant breeders , environmental protection and expert security for food security are the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but it is now necessary for that time , since his work is increasingly complicated by more constraints . &quot;
it &apos;s like a rock would lie in a river around which I have to go down .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think this patents go far too far from Sal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; and when it comes to judgment , no one can cultivate a new form of sal@@ ads , because all the features are patented . thus , he makes it as good as possible and tries to stir up those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and strives to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement which is increasing in the USA and all over the world , Open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) . &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS have bred red tube sal@@ at of the sort of out@@ red@@ ress at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station bred and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched into life to ensure that certain types of plant species and assets are not protected as intellectual property , and so can be un@@ usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , in short O@@ ss@@ i , us can commit to US @-@ breeders to use that others can use them freely freely from them . &quot;
&quot; this , however , doesn &apos;t mean that they do not continue doing business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds , and it &apos;s not instantly distinguished - two aspects , which are forbidden by many plant pat@@ ente or prescribed . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; seed is therefore playing a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use latter or only little by using seeds with natural resistance capacity . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; Open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified crops .
&quot; however , all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ n@@ or , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not , from ecological agriculture , or not , is to know that the way it is cultivated in August or September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Nutri@@ tional sovereign without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to question other their seeds for free . thus , its action is to be patented in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Sup@@ er argued that the future of the food supply is at risk , since the available gene pool is endangered due to the ever @-@ numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material , which thus is always reduced , inc@@ iner@@ tia . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , occupied himself in her doctoral work with genetic variation of car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ders has been protected as intellectual property , which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ aged plants like wheat in still a large scale patented are as salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are cultivated so re@@ ared that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they flour@@ ish in certain environments and threats like p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders by more and more patents takes . genetic variety is at present but necessary than ever since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse predictable .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto @-@ speaker in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four of banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company will set up for the preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant variables . &quot; a patent is essentially taken a plan that can follow everybody as soon as the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method to come to the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection does not affect innovation , but encourages them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the different : 20 years to wait , until a patent recovery , certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time , to breed at plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the fight had already been lost . &quot;
&quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public , and they should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their job easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es in the concept of itself , plant @-@ features : &quot; we do not create the features really itself . &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we ultimately have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; those who grow a variety , also prints its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to grow in its varieties of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exact . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto ) patents create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ ernity or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton looks for in his breeding @-@ garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders would like to produce the pesti@@ cides of plant pat@@ ent@@ edly : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that have pat@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years before competition , which makes it very easy for me to make it quite beautiful . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ; the concept is spreading in the meantime , but rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; constitutes a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization of Agre@@ col works on an &quot; Open Source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the breeding differ from country to country , so because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , declared that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office , which allowed patents on conventional plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all over East Africa , to experience something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement and the global trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , explains for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &apos; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , that the organization currently shows a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start . &quot;
&quot; a consolidation of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map , to publish . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published global alliance for the future of Food - a combination of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , who have the opportunity to share seeds , to share and improve seed policy so that stable supply of food can be safegu@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; in the report is also stressed the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly been cultivated , where and how a little grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to realize the people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals for the cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities un@@ locking content on the Internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 05.@@ August the Egyptian government documented the website of the Action Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about sel@@ fish@@ ness .
&quot; August released the network an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities for this step are sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of that attack and judgment of Egyptian law , the law of Egyptian law should continue to defend themselves to un@@ cover the right to freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so difficult to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I , as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after more than two months of 21 pages , blocked the independent news item MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the from Qatar network from Al Jazeera due to alleged &quot; support from terrorism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; # Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ pages for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i had fallen by one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language of htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K &quot;
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no longer access to the blog of the Kolum@@ nis@@ ts and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer access in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles , which he has not written for in Egypt , not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog was set up in order to get the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider in which also the Zi@@ adas blog is found home , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , was arrested nearly 500 days in captivity , after participating in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , when he reported on the students prot@@ ector and recorded a video like the police physical violence against two students . &quot;
its articles mainly revol@@ ve about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada sent to the lock by the government and reflec@@ tive what this means for him :
&quot; the to block blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the lock@@ out of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of an ins@@ ulin condition ; A arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , though only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; now however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ te go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from May 24th to 06 . August 133 websites . this group of technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the locking of suppliers , by changing from the internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noted how the block@@ age of websites , which began V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter on the Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; in addition , the situation will wor@@ sen that the C@@ ens@@ ored decisions have been hit behind closed doors , by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which they can advance to the court against these actions . &quot;
&quot; now , the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack them be next ? &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers reviews the second largest city from Rio de Janeiro , the two largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ so the second day being murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es smo@@ ked pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ ans sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government of Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local paper .
&quot; so published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that can break down in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex , etc . all , which however happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio , is released in the column &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative to allow us to close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision is no reason for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video a journalist explains the newspaper that it controls the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial written the newspaper writes :
&quot; we realize that a war of war , if he is distorted , also can cause the atro@@ cities of the police , which sho@@ ots only and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; mean more than it useful ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l Pol@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , to call violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the security policy of the media and could make it difficult to account responsibility for the police . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - how extra is shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with uncomfortable investment in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ confident neglect of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , it is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mor@@ dr@@ ats per state , there is Rio in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which stresses , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , for years to repe@@ al the security policy of the state . &quot;
&quot; on these security measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police officers , to conquer a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a postpon@@ ement of death accidents . but after several years , the U@@ PP has been to protect against several reports of shift and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor assemblies , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made up of one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls for the state to use , funds and ways , which are typical of a war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; with which a civil war is an in@@ sharp point in the landscape , and to the object for &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ir@@ ky balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ our@@ y in Rio continues to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week , it is now that the police took the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to tra@@ verse the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this case @-@ head@@ lines made : an or@@ res@@ eller died as a result of shots , which had fired the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from the brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Nobel Peace Organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or , and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region &apos;s east G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the life of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations from the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was exercised by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have controlled controlled areas outside Damascus under si@@ ege , which led to residents on the one hand or through tunnels and control points of mut@@ g@@ ated foods . &quot;
&quot; due to the long @-@ term block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mi@@ cians teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; survival food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional in Syria herbal foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . they make their food however an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
&quot; the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , reported that for three years , this project was well @-@ known and pressing his relief that it is now more and more &apos; familiarity wins . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the planting of fungi , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ but will gather until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continue to gather donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel surcharge , locally fuel consumption from plastic are used to supply the generators associated with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of regions from the regions , &quot; &quot; fung@@ al &quot; &quot; before they tested their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now , they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months they have mushrooms everywhere distributed in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach man the mushroom breeding for different reasons &quot; : split of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege becomes visible .
we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that occurred in the North of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
&quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of State . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts , spread across the northern and central regions of the country , and around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June , Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande is similar in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite , are in Portugal alone 500,000 hectares burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts not a fire .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of the Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tiveness and fire @-@ control measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was not in a position to em@@ bodies the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al stated by the Confederation of Portugal by Portugal the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , there were streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot;
this Sunday they did this anywhere : there are endless reports of open roads which were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore building permits in oils related to high fire risk .
&quot; a sufficient proposal for the whale @-@ form , which had brought the government after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was bound by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led an attrac@@ tiveness of the law , which permitted the construction of the case by case permitted , if the applicant could be built on means of self @-@ protection , so that all was built , &quot; leads JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article on the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made slightly burning wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires this way continues to spread . &quot;
&quot; these issues are added to these problems that the civil protection of Portugal from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens were seeking information or tried to contact , to contact , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the site and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des and became apparent in this f@@ ateful weekend in October , so that the servers of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires were not with@@ held : and the website was more than half a million . &quot;

&quot; then he took what was left of his low reward , and went in Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks , who were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , as today , the life of the refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ tist refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hanging n@@ ylon before the open window so that we do not anticipate at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made them ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ged on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum report , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was homeless , was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that shared twice a day meal in need of aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ elled asylum seekers , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous . &quot;
&quot; the Human Rights Organization for Europe writes the human rights organisation for Europe , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centers . &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum law can only be shared by asylum center if they officially asked an application for asylum - what can be used after the registration of asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ si@@ ze@@ able life of As@@ her helped a@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made various works in the construction sector for several years , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this ran so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schn@@ apps .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentation &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24 @-@ time period . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transition to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ en companies , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the waiter and the kitchen are largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can sell packaging and const@@ ancy techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harv@@ ests on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end , stability and prosperity are at the end . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; neo @-@ report : legislative acts of Egypt allow de@@ composition of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clear@@ ance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si prot@@ ested . &quot;

&quot; Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global inter@@ ne@@ es shows &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a legislative design , which provides that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users must be able to use social networks within six months , within six months of winning legislation on the website of their full name as well as its payout number . &quot;
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison or sentenced to pen@@ alties of a pen@@ alties .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; may , another member of the European Union proposed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher sanctions for the President of the President or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ tion of the President as well as government institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the legislative proposal , such an act would be pro@@ secuted with prison and money la@@ undering , so right for the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the Dutch . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ mine a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated against the military coup , who had led to the minister of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested in the same case , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th May , because the prison fe@@ eder on human rights groups postponed the accused of bringing the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ load of among others arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court talked to G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to the Pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were arrested in the previous case , aged 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ischer activists to uni@@ fy documents
may Tunisian authorities six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project is .
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was directed mainly to an controversial action plan , according to the plan expressly provided a controversial action by the President of the Republic , who would expressly blame the corruption by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali who corruption accused officers of corruption , provided that this all un@@ lawful money was returned . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , thro@@ ws a light on how the presidential plans for the support of the law still look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to verify its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press , which journalists secur@@ es the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the district court in Tunis in Tunis . may be a witness in the event . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their statement ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Office of the People &apos;s Republic of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China before writing or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the rules , it is also stated that registration will be required with the full recur@@ rent name . &quot;
analy@@ st suggests that herein is to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
Chinese network citizens have proposed these provisions only selective in the social media to protect civil journ@@ alism and its independence .

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or reconc@@ iled We@@ chat , to register with the state government as the &quot; Organ@@ ator of the information @-@ proliferation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government introduces a list of online services that the &quot; publication of the information &quot; organise . &quot; the law allows the government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for identification of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently part of websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ no@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the E @-@ Mail @-@ service Mail@@ .ru and dish@@ on@@ est of other services . &quot;

&quot; a Turkish court ordered the lock@@ out Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia @-@ administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communications were blocked , the site had been blocked because it works to &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to address a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey &apos;s website is completely blocked . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Great Britain cannot stop her@@ ben@@ ding
&quot; after this week , the government of Britain is in the midst of a targeted consultation on higher monitoring systems , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs , de@@ code data encrypted . &quot;
&quot; however , the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technological companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
