<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American films, I danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who was with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud, who was the top federal court with judges who wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after method Man," me it was, as if this is the absolute truth, everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only been reinforced."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I said:" "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love-cover written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he walks with his bottedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps the mountain behind the mountain how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroam and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people reacted to his statements and voted for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes which he won at the Republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party nomination candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deep natural man, with whom I talked about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also the Trumps worldview not with the of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced among Sandy Bahr, which fighting for their lives long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits into the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise words helped me a lot with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while comforting his way to the nominated Republican Presidential dates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his disregard for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to miss these things, I broke almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"one of my friends said to me, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates a incapacity to understand the ones that act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears are not taken into account of the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most know are, for trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who say the cruel decision to rise a man who looks down with contempt to those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" ": as much as" "drawing of the White against all other ethnicities." "word from white in appearance on the White and whiplash, which means so much like slingstrauma, as it was the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have always like the Americas is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose the son of a Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, say it."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a written" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Would Muslims have a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brunt the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a lonely and soundless" "NO!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens within the scope of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, that ship had already been held in front of Africa's illegal fishing fishing before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly drafted and little inclined to welcome a legal brecher of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to give up one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing shelter."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly was the prime surrounded by countries that they just refused," "Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, crosses criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop) was founded."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are apart from Somalia and Madagascar, who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at the time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "" Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to apply. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the intentional contempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and types are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snow empires, the actions of these events happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of lists, updates to suspects activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to detect the authorities, ships of fish which fish in bad fields, too - such that suggests that a ship invites its own fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the ships involved have a fish license where they were on the road, and possibly, whether they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are opposed to illegal fishing, can then refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that the illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to attract 20 million USD to lost sales, which loses eight members of the network HISH-i each year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing ages that pulls the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of phantasia, the fish protected species and the fish in nature."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an incomplete organised control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship could not use illegally and a country could say 'You dared my port not to walk."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legale slip hole tries FISH-i now to close.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i participated in more than 30 investigations of suspects ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, which had been distributed counterfeited licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that were used several fraudulent identities and it has found volatile ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority on the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances and preserved."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that is to help the FISH-i to help, suspects ships precise, precise ships."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, will also help to hide the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be obtained by satellites Georgian."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland is therefore helping to build a system, which connects various information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team in African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believe."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has recently opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and through which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join together with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this is just meaning "," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project to run, in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only sense criminals but they also abrupt.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used earlier without a license and barely have to reckon with consequences are now aware that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now taken a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 doors, the inspectors found there on board tuppnetworks, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice this success." "the effect is so strong that we now have other countries to copy", "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, a hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six different countries have joined forces, so called West Africa Task Force." "With security, it is the goal to develop even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia had its first big triumph in October: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road with false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were hauled networks, which meanwhile were forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking up against Greko 1, the a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the World Sea. Emma Bryce is free professional journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the topic environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to rise. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bit wrapped, and commanded me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on this day, I went to the other end of the baracke where the stolen objects have been removed, and signed me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I sewn, and saw a couch on the human being tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captivated straight there.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overbet you need two important features: passive voice knowledge, in order to understand the initial text and to use active language skills to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother tongue. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native language for example should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo from Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be attributed to lacking understanding of the surplus, cost grounds or the relatively small number of English speakers that may learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have no foreign employees to make translations of our company internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is made as the best ones, are made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo from Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrrens and puzzling phrases created by mechanical translations, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that are often t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors might be acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian Parliamentary MPs recently agreed to "regulations on the regulations regarding use and usability of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">"when he is accepted by the Parliament, individuals and users have to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a position would then be set up to give citizens a permission to give social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of acceptance of the law, individuals and users have to register on the site of the site with its proper name and recruitment numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do this, that could be a punishment of up to six months in jail or money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paraglives and cursed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as" "every application, which runs through the internet and used to communicate with others through voice, video, and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced as it is accepted, since the draft no indication indicates how Egyptian authorities should not register how they are to register those who are unable to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Abdul Sattar, Parliamentary and Patrons of the Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received by the Telecommunications Ministry a username and password" "to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that as well as they can control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"when I take it seriously, this means that they will be a strong surveillance system to be up to citizens who apply a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor citizens' activities and to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative of Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring globals Fukushima and Iwate were forced into force, because the tsunami had finished whole coastal cities out of the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"on the basis of the Fukushima prefecture a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows what progress has been reached for six years to re-establish the life of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of the persons concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>

<seg id="552">"the biggest success amongst the three prefectures was able to see Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, one has always endeavored, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation shelters (the most important, casetsu juutaku) into final spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelfswald.</seg>

<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people have the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid to face. we must show the international community, the conflicts, disintegration and state of state."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a leship of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central-Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that they should never consider violence as normal, regardless of what shape it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and Sensational journalism I have been known for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day of newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures that can only be taken from a textbook for criminals or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only thing that is disguised or sad. it acts like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You are writing further:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year Cousin thinks he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders, when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me that is, as if they were digging those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that they may have something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the insomnia of people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the bolted of 43 students in a neighbor so be justified that they were" "dental vinegar". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak out of such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post-four months extortion in the main city district: like a family with threats, it was pressed, as armed crime month for month money from their business, until they ended up not only the business but also had their families apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain over never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, if you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the further we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these scary days if crying my deep-rooted feelings would dissolve, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to cribe. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence signed.</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents are concerned about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a commodity and he tells that he had to teach yourself how to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the shutters with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said that his mother was gone."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had already been over two years earlier, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, who saw bloody suffering from his father, who had been shot by armed men from a squad car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born as Bryan, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder and Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the prosecutor was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of the hundreds of thousands of stories that are organised in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are still living in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "has launched its goal, the complex information behind the struggle against drug trading, which has tormented the country over the past four decades in a natural way."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first publication it was used to use, tragedies on pictures that have occurred actually in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false pairing of image and event -" wrong description "or" wrong context "in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">"however, it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news."</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a petrol station passed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kickled and exploded. 230 people came to life."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's two largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devastated. the streets in the region have become too dangerous paths of percussion, which were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"ironically, it fell to the victim of the petrol car."</seg>
<seg id="828">"administration representatives described a fireball who described the cleaning houses including a movie near, which was full of people who knew the football world champion."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses groomed and shortened corpses in the streets scattered.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "That is Nigeria". "from Imgur-users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the previous day form the gray scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of shortened body that are depraved on the ground while they look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but rather, not related to tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse charges are in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." "no one stayed back to count corpses," said a population to Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were caught, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the following time could be illustrated."</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved but the army-based point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture came from the DR Congo again as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacres of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abbral use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of miscarriage; Africa Check has documented accesses to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all of these cases, the picture was presented as a testament to massages."</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further will bring personal comments like this example the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a Blitzmessage, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee beats, rape and some deaths, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on violence against the Rohingya, deaf posts like the following that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page which in 2012 asserted that President's Thein's Thein has been told, monks and politicians had been involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of the DR Congo in order to show this information."</seg>

<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling range dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mosambians reacted to a corruption incident, in which a government member returned to the workplace of the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this was arrested by Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 with four other defendants because of 54 million methtics (approximately 800 000 Euro) was sentenced to 22 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008 stood.</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance, and immediately called his re-setting into the company, which was then on 19th April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the General State-General of the Republic, which claims the request, there would be no barriers to Cambaza, back to his old post, because the company did not perform a disciplinarity after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrdade PÃºblica, briefly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, sentenced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company, to establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption, the lack of transparency and is even a backstage with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplinarity against the inconsistencies.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company schwieg apparently seems and causes no appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour and considers the case to be contradictory": "</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and left half of them."</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could maintain lectures and motivating speeches he could advise and be advice on his image police.</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to become reintegrated into the company that he helped cause damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for its silence."</seg>

<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he obased him, I can't believe someone in such a way that the state has already been so massive."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing the morals and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a handcraft in order to become an inexhaustible money source, and the state itself has become tired, who precharged and eventually was sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly I don't know why this man was rewarded so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they included the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people east of India's origin or generally used as adjective."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or at the same time as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of the rise of radical movements of the word has given an extremely abrupt connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is usually used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate language in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'may normally be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call upon hate language."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts as expressed for his use, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several Burmical words with the fundamental different meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmisch also is written 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' ('camel bse),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends on spiritual art, whether she knew how he might relieve his back pain, that he made a word."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the proposition ku la -" "healing" "(la) on Burmisch - resembles the racial expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win Had, the opinion that she's hate speech is going to decrease radical nationalists, but also that Facebook will have to be more analytical, before it's all posts who spread in suspicion of suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write on facet.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar PAE "(spider)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-legged nationalists spread, the hate language, has received quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to circumcised its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all of them, the hate language may be spread, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often will start a Katz- and mouse game, whereby users use social networks to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censor word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook began to delete his post, when he only talked to his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is exiled from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my postal mail was removed from Facebook and was forbidden to do the light, posts and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post office does not speak the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show off their opinions against hate talking radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmical Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform but so it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words will only cause more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without a local context or technical support and so called" "chair" "or" "Cresencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the miserunsolved posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which make them a big turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has made a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously take users about Facebook fun and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1351">"a Hindu guide, B. did not have any concerns to say the critics of the children's marriage, they should, be condemned for their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point, doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the law was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained himself in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would have taken him to the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">"now, only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with great care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard this practice to life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian State of Odisha by a shot and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relatives."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also did not name their wives to name, is also widely used under men. however, they have far less access to fear, if at all, if any, they should not fail."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals, as well as housewives, became a unique club and were therefore quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemy of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that gives it in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the exploitation of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to uncovering practices, such as children's council up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">"it tells you about how these clubs created a safe place for these women, and at the same time they have made ambassteries of change."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that showed the Rohini in its discussion, acted by women who call their husbands not to name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted a conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that the women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to speak the name of their husbands, is a Brauch, which is maintained all guilty and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is considered as a listig when a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is rooted so deeply rooted that we have never thought about up to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband before, at home, try out at home, as it runs at home."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">"my mother-in-in-law, and my husband had lacked a long time after the video was at the end."</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should tell him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate. "some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video project, women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of their husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us, meaning that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the brake of a centuries-old tradition, in which women married the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that over the whole exercise only burned down in the whole exercise; another decided to let the whole uptake care against him and his family by hiding him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in adrenalin, even in adrenalin, in adrenalin, to have broken braces, the women decided that they were actually trying at home to call their husbands when they were called."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept her word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women into his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another small member chose to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she ascended, she got fear and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I will do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in less understanding and the situation arded in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"reported as women reported, as women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing of the interest noberred spot on the forehead, which indicates the adulteratus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnoberred dot, if he was also active."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed only and I heard to carry him out.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but they are now in a better position to choose themselves, in some days not to bear."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip with every discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and saddled about things that they had never done before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things, for example how our identities have made to our husbands, never to be honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things according to saying, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to your clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have taken only Saris in the group since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is that okay, but some wanted a sage-Kurta, a vast shirt over a trouser; they did not trust themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes elections, morality joined with the saris and much more, dingigelte Rohini their own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question about whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed something that things are slowly coming into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have taken only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened again to saying the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now contribute to Zinnoberred at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the lelight to get more freedom of movement or their own hangers - at the end of a hard drive to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"giving them self confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarch.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman is going home in the club to other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be regarded as a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the bloosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of New York, the minister of New York commented that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, since Singapore was compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether new York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," the logic to rotate "the logic to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and sacrificing, to create this valuable country, you hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the impression of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, then country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the topic once again the good old corer from the authoritarian makers will leave, leave the twisted logic, since they fit their power better."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final effect, those in the last week of Shanghgam gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our judictative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tared with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which land belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our worth of K Shanmugam would take up this issue as long as it was paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on his comment on his blog, he pointed out about the critics that they should begin to read the entire part of the conference, so that the Singapore would be better understood by the statements of Shanghgam, according to which Singapore would be a city, and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the comments.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore was more like a" city "than a country," he stated why the elections in Singapore were so unequitable, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He studied Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" "is not a country," "he obviously does not mean in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is a leader in a growing generation, such a polemical statement."</seg>

<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I agree - be with them or not, but this is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanghgam, Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I'm not even sure whether he really believes, really associated it and be aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review presents the weaknesses of Shanghgams:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr Shanghgam committed an error", "or was it a boldscher betrayal?"</seg>

<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government, the statements of Mr Shanghgam are of severe importance."</seg>

<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have been annoyed a lot of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "the defense of the country, especially" "etc., but that's not quite true."</seg>

<seg id="1745">"on my clarifying position then mostly follows the default answer:" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians are perhaps inwardly in anger before anger, if they are held to Americans but don't bother me that. "</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: as a" "nice" "to be described, is basically to be spill - like the good-natured, gentle, but tragic, unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "no personality has."</seg>

<seg id="1771">"harmless, means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not paying attention."</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remotely from the things that happen around one around."</seg>

<seg id="1823">At the entrance to the village Dzhantukha I met a native older man.</seg>
<seg id="1824">He starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "all is a result of war." ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"can I talk to you?" "why?"</seg>
<seg id="1827">"nevertheless, it is still unique."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In front of war the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"there were municipal centers, schools and kindergartens who served all of the community."</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with remaining splendor-buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">"the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union, have now left the district."</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town of Dzhantukha there are about fifty inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="1833">"about 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar."</seg>
<seg id="1834">"the Khrushchowkas, which are still one or two families, can be seen at the balconies, where laundry dried."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"when they discover me with the camera, they immediately pull back."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"our mother allowed us to take pictures," says one of the girls. "</seg>
<seg id="1838">"why?" "it simply has forbidden us, that is all."</seg>
<seg id="1839">The girl whispering her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining companies called Tkuarchalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">"families are also involved in the subsistence industry (cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs) such as cattle breeding, bee-keeping and vegetable cultivation."</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to get over the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="1843">"the District administration provides for free candles, and bread to the villages in winter."</seg>

<seg id="1847">About ten years ago there was an older woman named Galina (or aunt Galya as it is called in the neighborhood) from Akarmara to Junghantukha.</seg>
<seg id="1848">"despite her oldest daughter who lives in France, Galina has not left before AbchAsia to live with her." my heart will remain forever in AbchAsia. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1849">Galina wants to accept no financial support from her daughter and insists that she has supported her young grandchildren instead.</seg>
<seg id="1850">Galinas monthly Rent are just nine dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1851">"if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house, it is very hard to survive," she gives. "</seg>

<seg id="1860">I have already prepared the floor.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"together with her husband and the five common children, he lived in her house for some time."</seg>

<seg id="1882">"in fact, it has to do something with looting."</seg>
<seg id="1883">After the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right.</seg>
<seg id="1884">I remember every day like the city and the war once were.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"when our conversation tends to the end, a little boy passed on to us."</seg>
<seg id="1886">It runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself.</seg>

<seg id="1895">"ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, the State of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bring.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article from Amy Bring was published on 19 April 2017, on the website of our partner PRI.org and will be released here with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year Mexikanerin, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillengestell and goldcolored ear rings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was raised there in Tapachula. yet they know many of the name Mom Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they) have become a goal for Africans and Haitian who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with separate, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and hairy migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines which they cannot pay, they mask them with a balsam that of the long journey exhaustive futs."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is just a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtbeard) with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bring.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "yes," "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it fits to it, since African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find out there her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil for some Africans, who are on their way to the United States, to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other leaders of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a known name on the route, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitian and Africans often travel the way together and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and has worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa's guest for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to purchase the bus ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," he answered smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that her guests are sending her many times news when they went, to kiss her or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, there is a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter was added to Valenela and his family migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has started to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooker outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"Valenela explains, that he knows what the guests are doing through."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was taken out after a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to get money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single one, has offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"some months later, the family is still living there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large proportion from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she is in her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hairdressers you made a customer in, some photos of her grandkids and many travellers more, young and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she briefly presents me briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeated them every time. "you already have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-Point for personal communication tools in Xinjang, from Twitter users, who are working on board."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of the city Urumqi received a mobile phone notification in which it indicates the District government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web cleaning"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities then use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they were shortly after they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private mobile chat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app stood to determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and pursue, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, books and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block of pornography web sites, from online fraud, Trojaners and phishing sides to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control your home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors shall help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote "" government actors or even hackers might beg the home network of a person or to steal it. "</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while talking about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities of the east and south, the reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, forced ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit turmoil and dissatisfaction in the conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and monitoring measures, as well as routinal Internet circuits."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"this was published on Twitter-based media outlet 'images from Mainland China., the censored news in China published, showed photos of a checkpoint, at the policeman, on the policeman, whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian represent certain that the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained by up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"they are forced to use the people, devices, which are intended for older people."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage by rest of rest technology.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang the computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang will become electronic towels.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government officials, authorities and related establishments, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office at the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"an up-to-date report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned this new monitoring methods:"</seg>

<seg id="2008">"I passed the silence by crying several times" "Allahu Akbar" "by my house."</seg>

<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you your voice after you got it all the way up to the office of the security service out of the body.</seg>

<seg id="2080">It must have been so at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say this was my only option.</seg>

<seg id="2089">Where do they guide me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the jordal Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free speech and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; times he lowers his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what you can rely on, is a cigarette between its fingers, or its with nicotine berries, to discover the lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top of his family house, which had heard them since 1967; the year, in which Israel was completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had to escape from her village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who introduces itself to the conservative majority and to ask their old-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and Rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, who often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestine, he also calls for all these issues not only in his hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that reach from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries, and can have to suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not give it open to U.S. foreign policy, he triumphs against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas, to survive anything with his identity as" Palestinian detonous of the second generation "- he describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living conditions," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he shook in water, NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is provided for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordant law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for this to break with urold traditions; on the other hand has a cup of coffee at a senite hot Junitag little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slots speak warm coffee and the swader of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it simply avoids to do basic things - as to drink water during the Ramadan of water - not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens had a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some Parliamentary MPs, who support the Islamic Action Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsers Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokesman in the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was said" "just" "because of the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also say, the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which constitutes the unapproved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the jordant people as" progressive supporter of human rights, "which continues to be decided on an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may probably not be easy-to-seizing rhetoric, but actually reflected a more and more evident reality in Jordan, which appears in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional gender standards come to Leibe by carrying out his vision of the fate of Arab women who have foreshadowed sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of an apparently lapped woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years Jordan has increased the number of 'honorary morals' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals in 2016 reached its culmination; however, Jordan has not yet reached that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support the victims such as murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law of crime against the year 1954 women, who are exposed to the danger of inner violence, and for their release is often an years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity, and is known also not to withdraw issues which in his country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, does however, that he is his music, which is full of explicit attachments to sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"for me, politics was prosecuted," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" hits the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lavla al 3aib" "and in" Ghareeb "is the focus again on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get, in his words," which you want "" is it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanic OnlineProgramme Roya, to later notice that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored by his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which is still alive today thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: when Abu Nuwhat is to work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century was able to write about homosexuality, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government's government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordant Intelligence took a number of former governmental members and members of the curriculum firm, with the reason they had expressed themselves in social media critical about the problems that are deeply rooted in the country with deep roots."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert Hdaibs, the concert Hdaibs, in view, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress has been a constant and taking place for him. Jordan has melted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks like Hdaib - it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreams not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is going to be filled with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, scammunition and artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it has been done, Hdaib will continue on and therefore also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to the Aman as a student field."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one thought that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forks, the drums and the tances are marched over more than one thousand years, in the armies of Japan in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" Liebesmessage to guerrilla fighters "," which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel extinct?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation of Bogota.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country venue was a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace agreement was as significant as the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"but in front of the Colombian, however, there is a long way to be able to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"the guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and around the clock have to integrate their weapons back to life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society again, which had used to live in constant fear and in some cases a deeper hatred towards guerrilla warfare, it has to record its ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young columnist would be together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla fighters who are then to be transferred personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation arose in the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there had Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he is planning, he told us on this year his love with people who needed the most urgent support."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"to write the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to establish a new life." the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to be a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I have never thought, that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on March 19 in one of the UN warehouse in the Caldono region of Caldono.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Management of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota"</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC did so on how they had done before to counter the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands but letters full of undertakings of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very movable moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything, which lies in between "" told the political scientific student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, it led me a former fighter through the camp of Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambook "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had fear to go down, because besides him on the bed a MGL-pomeer, a deadly weapon in the thorn roster."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said nevertheless to him and asked," "Hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answered a letter that someone wrote me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I replied with the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the pomeets.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was pity the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the loyal companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. I had never thought that someone would forgive him for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I've only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to start-up, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had all grown up as already war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"for that reason, the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles", "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear these people who had never been heard before and had no voting right, and to realize that people who often have seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings are surrounded by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the land lives, I hurried."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us something and can give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianists was prophesied that after the drainage peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will be always people who are ready to attack arms and to protest for their rights. and this is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we are now putting the FARC to peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call on all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know of our own experience, that nothing is easy. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2283">The slogans to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some told me, I must prove it, that I had not changed in the official television in Grosny, and say I did not change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KÃ¶rbchensize C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family, but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a frog woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she lay down a strick around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later it was under the window a car with dark window cuddles and a numbermernschild with a 95 drauf.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened to the third time, I realized that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-friends overlapped the numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you go?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I want to do their names, but I will say that I will remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without having to register, without notice, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message:" you don't believe, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which Hotel du steckst. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality. however, this is a topic of tobacco."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally kaukashenian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chatting with camera, I actually give myself trouble how to see the person they remember from their past - so in my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has saved a and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he closed a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now concentrating on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with that, my I, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "through blood satisfaction has experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret cases?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or have been dropped by their relatives, to place Kadyrows judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be present as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be brought forth to show off their bodies and pretend, they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but submerged in order to become radical."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was in Argun one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have them taken.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were killed."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as a banker, so far there were no reports. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise you would not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have always been doing my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I believe, already in 2003 I already lived in Great Grosny when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, back then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil cularization", "but ultimately came back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were made; I had colored eyelashes, carried out tube-jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of Sharia has never even curved only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place, where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Spotte not about the unhappiness of another. "</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children if they make funny about crane.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes in front of you, because they believed, you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never sinned, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long has this Gnadment time held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister 2005, he began to speak on television on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us, but rather on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless - one could feel, how the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had settled in advance and had eight, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly swallowed out."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you now go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, gathering, I begining them to the hospital and help them to get essays."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not break a penny for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I swallow it.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddefrom?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is Algerian.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature is absolutely nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy to you with foam before the mouth, that there are no gays."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have, which, the cabardines have, which; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I have so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque, and during the Ramadan - live with men together."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"know you, many think in transitions of men who love men, and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a deception."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation, to be accurate, different way of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I am sorry that I become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad about it - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: there were all family ancestors, who were helpless on the part of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to feed their families and go to a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahmad community lived has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny the local Arab population to dispute its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in front of a century ago the Arabic Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most sought-to-use and most valuable placements for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dbes, the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie, embraced."</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to worsen the devastation devastated in the region and destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">Unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi teens rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Kooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announces that 5% of Ahwazis who have a job completed, 55% a further-leading school finished and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmad human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, leads to a" high rise "of the number of self-murder among the young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"Dohimi said, Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz new ethnic Persians, and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functional and institutions preferred not to Arab labour, the local Arab Ahwazi will dispose of access to working opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs, and to force them to earn their livelihoods outside their home Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their suburbs and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahmadazi and so to be placed as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activist alarm before the situation is explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the statement, written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. this article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women respond - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put a great deal of scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should all feminist * should be.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women nowadays still earn less money today than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women occur sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still going through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware of me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I can handle twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to talk about skin-color, on what type we had to suffer in black and black women, on what type we have been physically, mentally and verbatists, go to black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women, on which type we are physically, mentally and verbally, decide to keep many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"nevertheless, however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing their voices and sing 'Kumbaya' to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racial violence, which we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin, are less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girl and girls with a migration background more often the school is referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk, exposed to domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all men, all men, all men, and all men of all human color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman, who refuse to consider injustices in their thinking that relate both to the gender and the skin colour of one person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women ever and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"soccer 1851 in her speech:" I am not a woman? "and I also refused to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is in historical respect a humanly and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">I soak myself to join myself groupings which also absorbed by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs to drive their egocentric agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to create white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to honor the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different herds into a home and to prevent themselves from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I draw it before, me and totally emulate the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and the movement of Womanism, rather than to use me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn as a novel phenomenon is celebrated."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we can define black women after our own ideas and embark on us into the spheres which we are created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson Weems says that we can defend ourselves on our own way. not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I'm existing."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life does not exist, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2470">"in this documentary of Emily Kinskey, we are following Musa who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," Musa says. "</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# consecrate women) who reported about the violence of women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commander said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she has nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become active against violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship was some time passed and the police said, their statement would be placed among the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further Mrs. Balbuena due to Missions, also the acute display of Ada BÃ¡ez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">Some days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are issued at all times, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also subject to financially dependent on the men they do. this explains why only 20% of women who admit to be victims of violence at all, to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 beats and Statistics 2 invitations and a legal system, which is nothing undernimmable laws: good approach, lack of realization beats and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are truly weighed at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a Social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that do not even accumulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District state-state, 9600 ads were on domestic violence. at 70% of it, there was violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence against peace. also here are 86% of the ads of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women, that they were physically opposed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen women's minister in Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed." "on every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychic distraction, come 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman, which will be reimbursed because of physical abuse display, come two women who do not do this," concluded by the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's suicide in Paraguay have no own crimes, the law enforcement authorities can not be adequately documented how many women killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016 included journalists at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay the ten days dies a woman due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she did not want it, but then after. this should always regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years she carried out the mental violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable the most severe."</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would once become victims of distraction.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I've read earlier about it, I always thought that only women are happening to divulge because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed manufacturers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, as for example outeditor, the first plant, which was cultivated by NASA astronaut and consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Morton's work was only set by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salaries can get, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads have been patented, and that he could not continue to use them for."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents not only for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more and more such patents have always been registered in more and more plants such as grain or cartels. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and expert security for food security are the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton is still salad, but it is now necessary for that time, since his work is increasingly complicated by more constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like a rock would lie in a river around which I have to go down.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "I think this patents go far too far from Salate."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when it comes to judgment, no one can cultivate a new form of salads, because all the features are patented. thus, he makes it as good as possible and tries to stir up those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement which is increasing in the USA and all over the world, Open Source Breeding (" Open Source ")."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space station ISS have bred red tube salat of the sort of outredress at the "greenhouse" of the station bred and eaten. there will be tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open Source "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched into life to ensure that certain types of plant species and assets are not protected as intellectual property, and so can be unusable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, in short Ossi, us can commit to US-breeders to use that others can use them freely freely from them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this, however, doesn't mean that they do not continue doing business with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders only allow others to breed their seeds, and it's not instantly distinguished - two aspects, which are forbidden by many plant patente or prescribed."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed is therefore playing a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use latter or only little by using seeds with natural resistance capacity."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "Open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"however, all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, cornor, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not, is to know that the way it is cultivated in August or September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"Nutritional sovereign without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to question other their seeds for free. thus, its action is to be patented in contrast to the seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-Super argued that the future of the food supply is at risk, since the available gene pool is endangered due to the ever-numerous intellectual property rights based on plant material, which thus is always reduced, incinertia."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, occupied himself in her doctoral work with genetic variation of carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartottenders has been protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaged plants like wheat in still a large scale patented are as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated so reared that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they flourish in certain environments and threats like pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders by more and more patents takes. genetic variety is at present but necessary than ever since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-speaker in Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four of banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company will set up for the preservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders because" patents and the protection of plant variables. "a patent is essentially taken a plan that can follow everybody as soon as the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not affect innovation, but encourages them to be provided by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait, until a patent recovery, certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time, to breed at plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the fight had already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public, and they should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes in the concept of itself, plant-features:" we do not create the features really itself. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we ultimately have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "those who grow a variety, also prints its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to grow in its varieties of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exact. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the paternity or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for in his breeding-garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would like to produce the pesticides of plant patentedly:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that have patently. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years before competition, which makes it very easy for me to make it quite beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" "Open Source" "; the concept is spreading in the meantime, but rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "constitutes a" open source "seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization of Agrecol works on an" Open Source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for the breeding differ from country to country, so because the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, declared that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office, which allowed patents on conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all over East Africa, to experience something about the" Open Source "movement and the global trend for patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, explains for Hivos' program for 'Open Source" "seed systems, that the organization currently shows a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consolidation of environmental and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map, to publish."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, published global alliance for the future of Food - a combination of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, who have the opportunity to share seeds, to share and improve seed policy so that stable supply of food can be safeguarded."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report is also stressed the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, from the Luby of Ossi hopes to see him soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly been cultivated, where and how a little grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we now try to realize the people that there is even more behind their food. "</seg>

ANHRI have never been so difficult to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI, as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after more than two months of 21 pages, blocked the independent news item MADA Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the from Qatar network from Al Jazeera due to alleged" support from terrorism.

<seg id="2733">Its articles mainly revolve about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada sent to the lock by the government and reflective what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the to block blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfatah al-Sisi priority; and even if the lockout of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to give me the feeling of an insulin condition; A arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, though only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"now however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th, we noted how the blockage of websites, which began VPNs, began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter on the Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation will worsen that the Censored decisions have been hit behind closed doors, by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which they can advance to the court against these actions."</seg>
