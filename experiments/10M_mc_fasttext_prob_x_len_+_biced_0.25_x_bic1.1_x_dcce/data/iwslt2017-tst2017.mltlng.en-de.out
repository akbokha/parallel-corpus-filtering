this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , wrote R@@ isen a book in which he spectacular published that the NSA was illeg@@ ally heard by Americans of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , in which the CIA placed Iran literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible history .
but do you know whom the chapter did not appear at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government has identified up against R@@ isen and called it to call its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and journalists to the pit@@ falls . &quot;
&quot; according to the first Constitutional constitutional , the media has the right to publish information on the secret . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they are not able to protect the identity of the mu@@ le they provide .
&quot; so when the government arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that did many brave re@@ porters before him , he refused , and said he would rather go to the prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something happened exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and springs can always hide less .
&quot; rather than to get out and delay , you could also get his digital foot@@ prints on him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investigations have become involved , without his consent , his phone calls secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence , which they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wer source , to condemn . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le blo@@ wers . but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is at a great step by their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since 11 September , almost every article on national security was the result of that a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we are putting the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional statement , because the government has more and more possibilities to speak all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allowed to deal with the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and while they can take it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen his book , and it &apos;s much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transmission system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet , which was developed by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the post of the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there , you can upload documents to upload or send information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the relevant news agency . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot secretly provide any more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world always develop new sp@@ on technologies that are all endangering . &quot;
&quot; it is to make sure that not only forms of technology such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to put distr@@ action . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about abnorm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers , and will report by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider , who is warning us ahead of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks for thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; contains the greatest data le@@ ak of history . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; as we b@@ ast Robert Pal@@ mer from Global W@@ um to have a statement . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a truck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; . &#93; this week we were sent by messages about a truck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you establish it ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s stamp in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trail leads from 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , one famous cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there , and others who wait to wait for the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agency controller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this be something ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ eg@@ . , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world discussing media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens from a few are used to hide their assets and conce@@ al -- something that we have discussed and revealing them for ten years . &quot;
I think many people this whole world seems very confusing and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ oll .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what matters is . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; probably , because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , this scandal . &quot;
&quot; well , it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some US states to provide less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian . &quot;
&quot; this type of transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school @-@ areas , school children to be zo@@ omed . &quot;
it has frau@@ ds allowed to cut especially suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global W@@ ould we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a co@@ vert investigation into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African Minister , who wanted to bring money into the USA to purchase a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked it that all until a lawyer at our investig@@ ator proposals made how he could transfer his money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ fers . none of these lawyers received us as clients , and of course none of them was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covered investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ ci@@ er , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
this may sound very dre@@ aming as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite some things started to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen thinking about greater transparency what the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
&quot; the subject found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 , in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a legal design in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not do the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ W this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which arise and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it , through laws this kind of transparency to end . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the more transparent , which now allows for this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally finish . &quot;
that is the story as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a rear sale . &quot;
a guy who remained in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my belon@@ gings .
he bought one of my art works .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made just a road@@ trip all the country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today at night ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says that he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to put it in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; Ask , how to please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , star@@ ed to the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh guy ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a wild bo@@ il is asleep in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I received such a fear that I went out of bed on top of the bed , on top of the door , and my sleeping room door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought by me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
&quot; maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends who are only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; accommodate people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mates attracts and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can be able to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have passed on how we could earn something to make . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , with a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air wall on a wooden floor .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure to decorate our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we had to say our last guest and the door to the castle fell , then Brian and I fell on . &quot;
we had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in the roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mates , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether they could make a business concept .
&quot; thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on which people publicly post pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when you visit come . &quot;
on the internet they can invite wild@@ foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; no one who is fully at con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business , which allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you cling to the things which one can well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create through design immense trust , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I would like to give you a ta@@ d test which degree we trust we .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your Kom@@ for@@ tz@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to re@@ configure your mobile phone .
enter your de@@ coder mobile phone to your left .
&quot; this silent flight of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts , if they open the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , which is even more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the de@@ ported mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like who has now Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you ask on Twitter that he is part of the president of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have presented with his name ; if he would have told wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 respon@@ dents who say all : &quot; he can really make very well de@@ sper@@ ed mobile phones !
how would you feel then if you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to reject negative assessments .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their findings before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and housing . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social occurrence .
&quot; exciting , if you add the call of a person -- in our case through respon@@ dents . &quot;
if one has less than three respon@@ dents .
&quot; however , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation in common .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we also learned that confidence is dependent on how much one can get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one tells too little , as for example &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your home ! I make with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice to which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
&quot; with what we did not reck@@ on , the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay out these prejudices . &quot;
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
business is just very good for us .
&quot; of course there are times , if not everything is going smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties or have devast@@ ated dwell@@ ings .
hosts have to leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing s@@ lim@@ mer@@ es than these calls . it is already hurt if I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
&quot; fortunately , by the 123 million nights only a fraction of the problem had a problem . &quot;
for people trust each other right .
&quot; if confidence works , there may be wonderful works . &quot;
&quot; one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there , he suffered a heart attack . &quot;
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended up blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart , due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ru@@ ps that save life , although they do not know a real thing . &quot;
&quot; you drive in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to be lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they let you stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will run .
but these relationships behind the pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing together with banknotes ?
it is about an economical trade .
&quot; but now it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; to call , the thing is not just . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Share it describes a trade , which promises human relationships . &quot;
people lay part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel today , it is compared with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but for it is less authentic . &quot;
what if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place that one visits a group there would be a group to fill in a group , and to show a pub or a pub neighborhood of which you have never heard of before ; &quot;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to design apartments from reason to co @-@ sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have to accept the thoughts of the common part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and dis@@ closing . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government . &quot;
&quot; have been offered investors . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were passed on to people whose children were taken . were launched In@@ cub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality had also been there before .
there have been similar websites in front of us .
so why did it just work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we think that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find that amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I must contem@@ plate each time when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we of course know that design cannot solve every problem .
&quot; but if it was possible to help us if it had this great influence , I ask for what we design can soon be used . &quot;
thanks for thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or sup@@ pressed , a brain @-@ la@@ undering , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
thus the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee eli@@ ke -- dou@@ bling Esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I have been intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ like Fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homo@@ sexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to carry my head coverage . &quot;
&quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were de@@ em : &quot; &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the prime thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , making me a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought upon , asked in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and believed ultimately . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confidence and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the earliest , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes in building , people sp@@ ells from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into rebellion quickly .
why you should do something like that ?
&quot; I moved the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked my country , but in the N@@ u related me the deeds of others from a civil war in a suspi@@ cion . &quot;
the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA in order to move into a new city and begin studying .
&quot; I remember how I went in to silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I felt the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; be vigil@@ ant &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully , &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ed not you . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings asked : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw my extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably in@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stayed for Muslims , in the free fall and struck . &quot;
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have swe@@ pt the anger of people in terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations which are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims f@@ ans and mos@@ ques close .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor man as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one holds only in observation .
the alternatives are poin@@ tless because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are Muslims , like all the other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but rather an important organ . &quot;
thanks ! thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers ; Indian and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; maybe there will be a few parking free , but not the terror stop . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant , and show greater participation participation . &quot;
&quot; and like me , the head of the police in the Washington area of Washington , recently told : people will indeed not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process one has found that it starts online . as a first person can cut the person from their church , even by their family , so that the person believes that the person is true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ise their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or from faith . &quot;
&quot; when we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still affir@@ med that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS had its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe we must do everything to stop a group as the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves into their imagination , when one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks ! thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you throw a look at her , she is not pushing her what she las@@ hed in her &quot; &quot; Holy Bible &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to the silence , and told her that their anger , her sense of injustice in the world would only bring them into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense of their anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts who spoke a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m turned the link to God and her church again .
&quot; rather than acc@@ entu@@ ated them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS . &quot;
this was an idea of how the Islam@@ ophobia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect any other ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy , on our thoughts of freedom ? &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear to happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept more a authorised government system , conformity and prejudices . &quot;
&quot; one study reveals : if you have reported news on Muslims , in which negative about Muslims , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an acute problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the war of Iraq and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we might feel it first , but the toxic air of fear mel@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in order to blame , it is not just about how to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , much appreciated ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his course . she was stun@@ ned and said :
when is from my frat@@ ernity become such a sealed young man ?
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was on the afternoon . he did it in their apartment , as in an execution , after he had posted statements to Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he sli@@ pped eight times to De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we remained safe at home ?
&quot; we visited it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went to quiet , with high pressure on the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into prayer sh@@ alle , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank you and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to teach us . &quot;
at this moment I broke down .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those that are : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks lovely !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say that you might keep a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker , a thin@@ ker , in a fresh mind , so an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , fool himself not . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; looking at the Muslims around the world and I did that with the greatest ever done study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is short before , to become a billi@@ on@@ shop . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial threats . it is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before setting air package into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of air machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago she began to fly with s@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; through connections , air devices reach high speed and speed @-@ up for narro@@ w@@ ly space . &quot;
you can also build up hard @-@ to @-@ handle structures .
they have learned to carry loads with turbul@@ ence and respond generally to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the space in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system of aut@@ on@@ om works , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a offsprings of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each air@@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest levels . for example , &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
a leaf@@ let that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
&quot; like other star@@ ra@@ ils , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ r@@ flü@@ ers , it can float up and therefore has great benefits at start and landing , and is highly versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a limitation of tail@@ ors is that they are sensitive to turmoil such as wind arches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft is to be re @-@ reg@@ ained and improved the performance by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions related to the core of the cause . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that re@@ connect to you .
&quot; decades ago , pilots established television @-@ controlled air @-@ controlled air devices , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; un@@ long , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest air device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no lob@@ es , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no further pitches or controversy , just a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechanical simple , happening in the inner life very much , so it can fly stable , and move around in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to the fly , I must throw it right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the probability to throw it right properly , if all of them see is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in satisfaction , this machine is here , the om@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this passage ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; by doing so he receives the most au@@ stri@@ an ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , regardless of which direction it is filmed or even as he rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive river of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some is conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly at flies . &quot;
see this in us .
&quot; if passengers are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller engines .
this is clo@@ ck@@ wise in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them together they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if also restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took trading @-@ b@@ ular Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and provide them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine that wants to practice on Broadway will be a running lamp .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the salary is in development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , such as wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it creative , clever creations are allowed to form them in so spectacular ways . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago in a very remote galaxy two black holes are getting faster , they turned into the mass , so the mass tri@@ bun@@ als in a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of energy . &quot;
this short moment it shines bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they don &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been delivered into space @-@ time and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; in addition , we arrange the events at first time . &quot;
1.3 billion years ago was just multi @-@ zel@@ liges life on Earth .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought a lot : coral , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , people and -- God stand at us with -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss reached from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them were crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized her as crazy Gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector o : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eters - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LIG@@ O could be increased substantially in which the recognition of recognition has increased enormously . &quot;
therefore you now call it Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , it was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure of my to@@ ill father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all this for what I had worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ists from black holes and their through observ@@ atories as LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ pping in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; during the passing of the wave , the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and to the other hand . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity often become a really powerful dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous , are . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each one of us was stretched upon the meeting of the waves and stri@@ pped out . the stretching of an average person was 10 high @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 Nul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ around , one explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear generation . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os that are hunting for the waves following : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot;
but physic@@ ists are Finnish and the public support certainly will overcome all obstacles .
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 and 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott claims to LIG@@ O be more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial extracts , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite practical . for this way you can make an image or a map of things by contempl@@ ating the light around you .
with pots this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen to specific characteristics such as clay and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , now speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space .
&quot; but by keeping changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wav@@ e@@ pattern in all , we can literally speak the universe . &quot;
&quot; the gravity for listen , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , not revol@@ ving holes , cross @-@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very fast , you hear the same circle with an additional sound change . that sounds like that : Wu @-@ Wu Wu &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , engra@@ ved in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- I heard this as a noise from -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun@@ flower that turn around as fast as the rods of your bl@@ ender .
AA : think of what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most di@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the meaning of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O p@@ aves an entirely new way to study the Al@@ ls as they never had previously been possible .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not visible .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ onry stars explo@@ ded in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about all of them .
&quot; the exciting physical operations occur but at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon hidden . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would explore the first minutes of the al@@ ls , but we will never see her as the pri@@ mor@@ dial can be covered through his own neighbour . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly : I am optimistic that in all things exist that we have never seen before , which we have never seen before , and of which we do not have any idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it was the same in the first run of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produces black holes , such as LIG@@ O she ob@@ serves , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes are the sour@@ ri@@ er@@ bones for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O give us a completely different point of view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists to be as bold as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories in Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks for thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say too &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot;
wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , in front of me , I feared to eliminate my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life in an unexpected way . it all started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ able , I need milk for my beak @-@ asse . &quot;
she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from that there I can to play with them as soon as you call me up . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : first of all , I actually fully understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think you get things out of mind .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I produ@@ ci@@ er television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours to the world . &quot;
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that not existed before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
say we say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days four times four times , four hours TV , three Shows , which are simultaneously in production , four hours TV , three Shows , which are simultaneously in production , 4 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series are run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 this 70 TV @-@ hours are shows which I created by myself and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ . I need to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
know who that is still doing ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard if I &apos;m talking about work , a business or classroom , I understand that I don &apos;t just talk at the computer , a country or classroom , and it is true when I say , I understand that there is no dream at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is when I turned troops on a canvas .
&quot; so as if you have a high tone , run a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work it .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and maternal , sound@@ proof and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is to be . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working is good .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a busy street , I could go on her for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people take an account when I declare to them the sums , I &apos;m talking about writing that writing is given to me joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the buzz -- when I began to work and work with television production , when I began to work and to work , build up , and to work together , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . the buzz ! &quot;
the buzz is more than writing .
the sums of action is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz of the buzz is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sums , you cannot be different than the size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling that cannot be different from any other , regardless of size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more more the more episodes , the more progress , the more progress there , the more time there , the more they observe , the more I write history , the more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more needs to work me . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this sums . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this sums ?
and then it stops the buzz .
&quot; revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single division of activity . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Send , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
there are the children of a tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums up . &quot;
the buzz of the engine pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I did same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , did not work on weekends , no repentance , nothing del@@ e@@ ates , a Titan sleeps , not out , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan
&quot; everything was gray , I simply had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what makes you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; ha@@ l you out , bl@@ aming the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , one loves to be a teacher , one loves to be a teacher , a banker , one loves to be a teacher , one who knew what you know , if you knew the buzz , if you stop the sums , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I ask for my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; a question .
&quot; I am on the way out outside , late off and she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I already want to say NO , when I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it calls no more &quot; estim@@ able . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz , and here everything changes prior to my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we are playing and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of the Sum@@ mens , I can do nothing but leave . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , vigil@@ ance and the song , in which it is getting rid of , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron Cel@@ gin &quot; release . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door is going on and an energy horse is coming in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the titanium , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with broad@@ casts and television lessons , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz is . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sums is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot;
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sums depends on love .
the buzz is the river which comes from life .
the real buzz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks which are concerned , the expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; the real buzz is the voice of God in my ear , but maybe you whis@@ pering to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
once my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I make this a solid rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; wish , it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
play is not to me ans@@ at@@ ed@@ ise so how to work .
the truth is sore
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work because I love it .
I am rather at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this entry is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden around , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we Zer@@ plat@@ zen Sei@@ fen@@ bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always apply to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the buzz of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why do we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say ! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe , keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day @-@ dre@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; there you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they used to make them something different .
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes he replaces me a Mari@@ achi or K@@ eks .
&quot; and he speak@@ eth my teen@@ ager for 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for it . &quot;
&quot; each can bring about 15 minutes a piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that make the children bet@@ t@@ ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my kindness , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul fri@@ ght . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ;
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it .
&quot; I am not perfect in this . I sho@@ vel and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I was going to sur@@ mount myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why not full 15 minutes treat ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the tot@@ ality came back in my spare time . the sums then seem to return if I do not work .
works does not work without any gaming .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens in my office . I hear an unknown melody , they met me and my soul . she goes back to new ideas . I use it in full and love my work again . &quot;
I like the buzz but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz that sums up is not me ... no more .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the buzz of love .
&quot; the buzz of the work is part of me , but only a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
it is mine sn@@ acking that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan one of the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fire burn still .
&quot; the more I play , the happier I and my children are . &quot;
the more I play the more I feel as good mother .
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country , I run , the st@@ ank , the high clay , the sums , the buzz , the correct buzz : the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel of this sums , the more this unusual , be@@ aming , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel the exact sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I for@@ bid you to live . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this jobs , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks lovely .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies each day . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was working with functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard about one of the best known , the &quot; &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; &quot; there is an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the switching circles of the neur@@ ons , that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease that suffered under fierce te@@ ats and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading reception and worked on day and night in the emergency .
often cat@@ ered to patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at cran@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n grape trau@@ mas s@@ wimm@@ ers the brain and the skull @-@ noise increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to reduce the skull @-@ noise . &quot;
&quot; for this , one sometimes has to remove a part of wel@@ ded brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist who analyze the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue , is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there was Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , uns@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you are still aware of the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell ty@@ ty@@ p of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small N@@ ischen of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells stopped different .
they grew slowly and after a few weeks they died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our big hir@@ n@@ rin@@ den@@ cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the brain &apos;s body .
but why do they remain us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to see a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as they did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark afterwards to be able to follow it in the brain .
in the last step we rec@@ ited it at the en@@ closure of the same level .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ umn planning .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissues ? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells into bra@@ ised brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we tried the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks she had been taken off again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and re@@ inst@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
&quot; the proof that they show are these little ones . these are the cells , which we revi@@ ved in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain disorder ?
so we run monkey with a manual de@@ x@@ ure function .
you had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
that made them very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we last reached in the mot@@ oric Cor@@ tex the handicraft area . &quot;
&quot; then , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just as according to a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed , and then they try to recover with the help of plas@@ tic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were confident that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side they see the monkey which recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we re@@ plac@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the r@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results .
since that time we found out a lot more about these cells .
we can use them free@@ ze and later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even think , &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials at humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you look further into the future how many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients , perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
one must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the broken plant , which is in reality , but rather than inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as un@@ changing geography .
we believe that capitalism is leading to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ math in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impres@@ sing growth , while politicians remain completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - was un@@ ambiguous to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group - not to influence the austerity programmes , which were realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Ascen@@ ded friends , who would reiter@@ ate that democracy would change if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe together with me , to believe Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us democracy , but that we may need a truly and miserable democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are painted , our future d@@ ster and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to inform you of an interesting contradiction , which currently threaten our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt of debt , which casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the debt of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his / Gem@@ ini .
&quot; to invest a mountain of un@@ used cash , which could be too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income could contribute to where it would be productive and income , which the humanity requires urgent , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the last 3 months in the USA , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 l@@ lion dollars , in all the prosperity manufacturing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , gas , equipment , and so on and so forth . &quot;
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars sounds after a lot of money until one compar@@ es to the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars which at the same time did in the same countries and our financial institutions .
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , not equal in the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 years in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that would fail to kill the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors . &quot;
un@@ rolled the circumstances to bring it to that oil @-@ pus k@@ ills it .
this is my ha@@ ired with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely curved capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are critical for the salvation of the Earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a company form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to prevent the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these measures . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they were the working arms involved , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial to them the right to political co @-@ determination in questions of the state bar . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held long --
&quot; like a candle , which is very bright , she is quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy possible , and the democratic process was bound to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was opened . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies has been present in our present democracies since the time , at which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy gradually emigr@@ ated by policymakers and she dis@@ ma@@ iled . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are not as much more as previously ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because they can be in the government today , and nevertheless , not in power , because the power from politics to the economy is woven and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ders with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy which the politics grows so far . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are frightened to don@@ ate the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; ( the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy , and it would be better when the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; maintains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms regain only a miracle like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working arms ab@@ outs !
capitalism is doing it by autom@@ ating the Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ wing of automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will become higher , the extravag@@ ant summit , and the social conflicts more deeply , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and thereby make sure that we can change the re@@ united area , otherwise we can appear in a disease liable hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation appear . &quot;
&quot; the question is therefore not whether the capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is used by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; or something that is used in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , or in a long @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what to do , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a brief few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which one gets money , while you work , and in which your capital is coming to you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not belong in it , and those who do not belong in it . no more exchange between capital and labour , and ultimately no major gaps among investment and as@@ parag@@ us , and ultimately no ru@@ ined twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries , in the interest of the entire human race . &quot;
&quot; they continue to be negotiated that the entire world trade in this currency will be tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to trade deficit or trade over@@ flow of the country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are scarce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement .
&quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe to you is at the same time , in which she preferred people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ese . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we stand together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks for thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and the economy is ... do not do so , technological development will generate such a massive decline of overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagnation &quot; . &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and so I am also completely wir@@ elessly . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are also well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ r , one does not think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner , you have clearly told what you think about the West &apos;s perspective . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy on the policy , while most of the area , the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , when I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the British of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered . &quot;
liber@@ alism and Liber@@ als such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China , resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now proposing to do that which has done the West itself in the 19th century , called for hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ ings were curious about your experience as a Minister of Finance Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I used that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency and to the lasting denial , that a massive sealing line proce@@ eded through the eurozone , and continues to threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that this denial was revealed -- &quot;
&quot; to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continue to be chosen . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , due to political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay a while , but when the changes occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change is you ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- harvesting ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who claimed for 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims , he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the money gi@@ vers to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
&quot; they only wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the re@@ perc@@ ussions , which went through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to confess that they have led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika creditors , who have imposed on this policy and one : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and love Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for if they are not survived , the fre@@ aded fli@@ ers are demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not alone be disastrous for Europe , but for all the world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest business in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be equally toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; from Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is executive officer at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a fixed @-@ refreshment and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for giving the shows and content , the Amazon will produce . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ batt@@ ling industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy does not choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this turn . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the evaluation runs from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review receive .
&quot; your show will be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking bath &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , when you have looked at a season , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- that should you tell you what at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to be under &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the medium of labour , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time the Amazon that makes something so that Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he required success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas on TV shows and chooses an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows , and introduces them online where they can watch each person free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives things out for things out there , one still takes place ? &quot;
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when they look at these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who are taking everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you look at , what parts one jumps , or once again to look at . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide on these data to make which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from this it arises the answer , and that is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
do you know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many will remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ ed at 7.5 -- so something over the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out . &quot;
&quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organising a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had together all the parts , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but rather a drama series on a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . thus exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works super for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic seemed to be somehow that it should work at all .
&quot; when one collects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computer .
&quot; the min@@ de@@ te , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so this is something fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
is someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , this is even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the prison and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided if a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; middle television TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite of the many data , &quot;
not always produces the best results . this is not due to the fact that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the dates of the most sealed companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 gave Google known that they can say thanks to data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , which may be said -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news stroke . the success culmin@@ ated in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year round year by year until it suddenly no longer worked out , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows in decisions in the life of life -- on the work place , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; also I know a lot of difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have identified some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly , do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a first place you can analyze this problem into its parts , so you can analyze the parts ; as a result , you set the items together again to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but they are always two things : apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cr@@ ush a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to get the parts back together and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all have it : our brain . &quot;
&quot; when there is something that is good when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete , even if the information is incomplete , especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; for that reason I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which otherwise they would not have been capable of . but the decision , how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used the data to control all their decisions , first as she chose TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool and not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
before there was data this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get a reply . &quot; most likely &quot; -- just here at this moment .
I will leave it later with a machine @-@ demo@@ lition .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard on the ball in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by doing much di@@ pl@@ ating , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is cl@@ ums@@ y and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message that it still pays out to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the turn . &quot;
thanks lovely .
