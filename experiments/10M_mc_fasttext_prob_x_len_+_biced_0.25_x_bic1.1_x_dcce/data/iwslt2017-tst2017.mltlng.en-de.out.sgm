<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, wrote Risen a book in which he spectacular published that the NSA was illegally heard by Americans of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, in which the CIA placed Iran literally drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not appear at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government has identified up against Risen and called it to call its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and journalists to the pitfalls."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first Constitutional constitutional, the media has the right to publish information on the secret."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they are not able to protect the identity of the mule they provide.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that did many brave reporters before him, he refused, and said he would rather go to the prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something happened exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to get out and delay, you could also get his digital footprints on him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigations have become involved, without his consent, his phone calls secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence, which they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistle-blower source, to condemn."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistle blowers. but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is at a great step by their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since 11 September, almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistle-blowers went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we are putting the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional statement, because the government has more and more possibilities to speak all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allowed to deal with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and while they can take it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen his book, and it's much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the post of the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there, you can upload documents to upload or send information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the relevant news agency."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot secretly provide any more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world always develop new spon technologies that are all endangering."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to make sure that not only forms of technology such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to put distraction. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers, and will report by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider, who is warning us ahead of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks for thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 [the "Panama Papers" contains the greatest data leak of history.] [what does this mean?] [as we bast Robert Palmer from Global Wum to have a statement.] this week we were sent by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Mosbag Fonseca in Panama.] [what does it mean?].] [what does this mean?].] this week we were sent by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Mosbag Fonseca in Panama.] [what does it mean?].] [what does that mean?].] this week we were sent by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Mosbag Fonseca in Panama.] [what does it mean?].] [what does this mean?].] this week we were sent by messages about a truck of 11 million documents of the Mosbag Fonseca in Panama.] [what does it mean?].] [what does this mean?].] this week we were sent by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the Mosbag Fonseca in Panama.] [what does it mean?].] [what does this mean?].] this week we were sent by messages about a truck of 11 million documents of the Mosbag Fonseca in Panama.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say," "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you establish it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's stamp in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trail leads from 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, one famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there, and others who wait to wait for the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency controller or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be something?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Weg., these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world discussing media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens from a few are used to hide their assets and conceal -- something that we have discussed and revealing them for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matrjoscholl.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, it is not that there are no wealthy Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle according to which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that one needs less information in some US states to provide less information to create a company than to get a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this type of transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school-areas, school children to be zoomed."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has frauds allowed to cut especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Would we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigation into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself as an African Minister, who wanted to bring money into the USA to purchase a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it that all until a lawyer at our investigator proposals made how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all prefers. none of these lawyers received us as clients, and of course none of them was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covered investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politicier, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dreaming as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite some things started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen thinking about greater transparency what the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the subject found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013, in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a legal design in both parliamentarians, but this does not do the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global WW this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which arise and say," Intransparency is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it, through laws this kind of transparency to end."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the more transparent, which now allows for this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish."</seg>
<seg id="96">That is the story as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a rear sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy who remained in the red Mazda and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and made just a roadtrip all the country. after that, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep today at night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says that he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to put it in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," Ask, how to please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, stared to the ceiling and thought," Oh guy! what did I get there? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boil is asleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I received such a fear that I went out of bed on top of the bed, on top of the door, and my sleeping room door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought by me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends who are only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"accommodate people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates attracts and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can be able to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have passed on how we could earn something to make. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, with a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air wall on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure to decorate our cheese-ham Omeletts completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. when we had to say our last guest and the door to the castle fell, then Brian and I fell on."</seg>
<seg id="134">We had just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommates, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether they could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"thus we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website, on which people publicly post pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when you visit come. "</seg>
<seg id="139">On the internet they can invite wildforeign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is fully at consolation would invest in a business, which allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you cling to the things which one can well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create through design immense trust, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a tad test which degree we trust we.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your Komfortztzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to reconfigure your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your decoder mobile phone to your left.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts, if they open the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, which is even more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the deported mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also the most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like who has now Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you ask on Twitter that he is part of the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have presented with his name; if he would have told whence he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 respondents who say all: "he can really make very well despered mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to reject negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their findings before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted with Stanford a study. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and housing."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="181">"exciting, if you add the call of a person -- in our case through respondents."</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three respondents.</seg>
<seg id="183">"however, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we also learned that confidence is dependent on how much one can get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells too little, as for example" "hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." Tolle artworks in your home! I make with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we did not reckon, the large amount of people who were more than ready to lay out these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">Business is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course there are times, if not everything is going smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties or have devastated dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have to leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing slimmeres than these calls. it is already hurt if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, by the 123 million nights only a fraction of the problem had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, there may be wonderful works."</seg>
<seg id="211">"one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there, he suffered a heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended up blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to tend to heart, due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protrups that save life, although they do not know a real thing."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to be lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They let you stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will run.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing together with banknotes?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it's just" "rental industry" "to call, the thing is not just."</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "Share it describes a trade, which promises human relationships."</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is compared with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but for it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place that one visits a group there would be a group to fill in a group, and to show a pub or a pub neighborhood of which you have never heard of before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from reason to co-sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to accept the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and disclosing."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"have been offered investors. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were passed on to people whose children were taken. were launched Incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality had also been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we think that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must contemplate each time when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it was possible to help us if it had this great influence, I ask for what we design can soon be used."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks for thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brain-laundering, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee elike -- doubling Espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I have been introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtelike Fitness fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to carry my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were deem:" "why oppressed you yourself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the prime thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, that I felt as 17-year-old, making me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought upon, asked in question, doubtful and believed ultimately."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone you perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow love?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the earliest, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Eilmessage." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes in building, people spells from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into rebellion quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why you should do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the television channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists,... "..."... "..."... "..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only attacked my country, but in the Nu related me the deeds of others from a civil war in a suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA in order to move into a new city and begin studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went in to silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I felt the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "be vigilant", "" "Seid carefully," "lead in well lit areas," "Versammmed not you."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings asked:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw my extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably infiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stayed for Muslims, in the free fall and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have swept the anger of people in terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can actually say people:" "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims fans and mosques close.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor man as a whole and a benign tumor one holds only in observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are Muslims, like all the other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but rather an important organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks! thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers; Indian and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a few parking free, but not the terror stop."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant, and show greater participation participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me, the head of the police in the Washington area of Washington, recently told: people will indeed not be radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process one has found that it starts online. as a first person can cut the person from their church, even by their family, so that the person believes that the person is true Muslims, and anyone who despise their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or from faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"when we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still affirmed that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS had its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe we must do everything to stop a group as the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves into their imagination, when one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks! thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you throw a look at her, she is not pushing her what she lashed in her" "Holy Bible". ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to the silence, and told her that their anger, her sense of injustice in the world would only bring them into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense of their anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who spoke a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the link to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accentuated them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an idea of how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy, on our thoughts of freedom?"</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear to happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept more a authorised government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study reveals: if you have reported news on Muslims, in which negative about Muslims, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an acute problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the war of Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we might feel it first, but the toxic air of fear melts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in order to blame, it is not just about how to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, generous man she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his course. she was stunned and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was on the afternoon. he did it in their apartment, as in an execution, after he had posted statements to Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we remained safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we visited it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we went to quiet, with high pressure on the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went into prayer shalle, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thank you and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to teach us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I broke down.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choosing in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those that are: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="410">"through connections, air devices reach high speed and speed-up for narrowly space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up hard-to-handle structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads with turbulence and respond generally to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the space in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system of autonom works, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each airmachine has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest levels. for example," "Start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other starrails, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starrflüers, it can float up and therefore has great benefits at start and landing, and is highly versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailors is that they are sensitive to turmoil such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft is to be re-regained and improved the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often provide basic abstract questions related to the core of the cause."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smallest number of movable parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts that reconnect to you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, pilots established television-controlled air-controlled air devices, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"unlong, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest air device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it only has a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no lobes, hinges and cross-ruder, no further pitches or controversy, just a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanical simple, happening in the inner life very much, so it can fly stable, and move around in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to the fly, I must throw it right correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability to throw it right properly, if all of them see is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is a exercise in satisfaction, this machine is here, the omcopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this passage?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so he receives the most austrian ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, regardless of which direction it is filmed or even as he rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive river of the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly at flies."</seg>
<seg id="450">See this in us.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if passengers are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if also restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units offers a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took trading-bular Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a disc bread -- and provide them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where the room is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine that wants to practice on Broadway will be a running lamp.</seg>

<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>

<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been delivered into space-time and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"in addition, we arrange the events at first time."</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was just multi-zelliges life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has brought a lot: coral, fish, plants, sauces, people and -- God stand at us with -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss reached from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized her as crazy Genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector o: the laser-Interferometers - gravitational-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be increased substantially in which the recognition of recognition has increased enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore you now call it Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, it was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collious black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure of my toill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this for what I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists from black holes and their through observatories as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cropping in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"during the passing of the wave, the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and to the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for relativity often become a really powerful dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each one of us was stretched upon the meeting of the waves and stripped out. the stretching of an average person was 10 high-21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1st Dararound, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear generation. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos that are hunting for the waves following:" the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are Finnish and the public support certainly will overcome all obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973 and 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims to LIGO be more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial extracts, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for this way you can make an image or a map of things by contemplating the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With pots this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot of things:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to specific characteristics such as clay and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, now speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by keeping changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wavepattern in all, we can literally speak the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity for listen, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not revolving holes, cross-pen simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast, you hear the same circle with an additional sound change. that sounds like that: Wu-Wu Wu "</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement of movement, engraved in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- I heard this as a noise from -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-facher sunflower that turn around as fast as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think of what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most diest body in all, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves an entirely new way to study the Alls as they never had previously been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masonry stars exploded in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical operations occur but at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon hidden."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would explore the first minutes of the alls, but we will never see her as the primordial can be covered through his own neighbour."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things exist that we have never seen before, which we have never seen before, and of which we do not have any idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, it was the same in the first run of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the O project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produces black holes, such as LIGO she observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body of prehistoric times. the black holes are the sourrierbones for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO give us a completely different point of view of the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories in Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks for thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year I would say too" "Yes!" "before which I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, in front of me, I feared to eliminate my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- Puff."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes, my life has changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life in an unexpected way. it all started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimable, I need milk for my beak-asse."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from that there I can to play with them as soon as you call me up. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a striking side-effect: first of all, I actually fully understood that the" "Yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think you get things out of mind.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I producier television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours to the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that not existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Say we say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days four times four times, four hours TV, three Shows, which are simultaneously in production, four hours TV, three Shows, which are simultaneously in production, 4 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series are run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 this 70 TV-hours are shows which I created by myself and not only produced, so still obend. I need to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard if I'm talking about work, a business or classroom, I understand that I don't just talk at the computer, a country or classroom, and it is true when I say, I understand that there is no dream at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I turned troops on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as if you have a high tone, run a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and maternal, soundproof and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is to be."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working is good.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on her for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take an account when I declare to them the sums, I'm talking about writing that writing is given to me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began to work and work with television production, when I began to work and to work, build up, and to work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz of the buzz is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you cannot be different than the size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling that cannot be different from any other, regardless of size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more more the more episodes, the more progress, the more progress there, the more time there, the more they observe, the more I write history, the more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more needs to work me."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single division of activity."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Send, I want to go to Shonda-Land. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums up."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, did not work on weekends, no repentance, nothing deleates, a Titan sleeps, not out, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show-Titan</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I simply had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" hal you out, blaming the author-Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, one loves to be a teacher, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, one loves to be a teacher, one who knew what you know, if you knew the buzz, if you stop the sums, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I ask for my "southern states waitress" a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out outside, late off and she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I already want to say NO, when I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no more "estimable."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything changes prior to my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we are playing and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read completely dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of the Summens, I can do nothing but leave."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, vigilance and the song, in which it is getting rid of, or whatever the girl in" The Iron Celgin "release."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy horse is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the titanium, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with broadcasts and television lessons, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "the sums is not a force and it is not labour-specific."</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the river which comes from life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks which are concerned, the expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is the voice of God in my ear, but maybe you whispering to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a solid rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"wish, it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not to me ansatedise so how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is sore</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entry is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We Zerplatzen Seifenbubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always apply to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why do we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe, keep me for naïve, for a day-dreamy."</seg>
<seg id="742">"there you have probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they used to make them something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes he replaces me a Mariachi or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and he speaketh my teenager for 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, there is no need for it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring about 15 minutes a piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that make the children bettready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my kindness, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul fright."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it is about joy;</seg>
<seg id="759">"to play" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in this. I shovel and I siege. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" "is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I was going to surmount myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why not full 15 minutes treat?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totality came back in my spare time. the sums then seem to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works does not work without any gaming.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens in my office. I hear an unknown melody, they met me and my soul. she goes back to new ideas. I use it in full and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz that sums up is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of the work is part of me, but only a part. and for this I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">It is mine snacking that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan one of the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my bonfire burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country, I run, the stank, the high clay, the sums, the buzz, the correct buzz: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel of this sums, the more this unusual, beaming, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel the exact sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things out, I forbid you to live."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this jobs,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks lovely.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies each day."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was working with functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard about one of the best known, the" "Tiefenhirnstimulation." "there is an electrode deep in the brain to influence the switching circles of the neurons, that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under fierce teats and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading reception and worked on day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often catered to patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at crandel-Hirn grape traumas swimmers the brain and the skull-noise increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to reduce the skull-noise."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, one sometimes has to remove a part of welded brain."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist who analyze the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue, is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unsmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biologielessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell tytyp of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small Nischen of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They grew slowly and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our big hirnrindencells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the brain's body.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to see a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as they did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark afterwards to be able to follow it in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we recited it at the enclosure of the same level.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autumn planning.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissues? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells into braised brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we tried the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks she had been taken off again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and reinstated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these little ones. these are the cells, which we revived in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain disorder?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we run monkey with a manual dexure function.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we last reached in the motoric Cortex the handicraft area."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just as according to a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed, and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were confident that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recreation, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we replaced the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even think," I know someone who need this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials at humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you look further into the future how many years it takes to come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients, perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the broken plant, which is in reality, but rather than inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchanging geography.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great aftermath in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressing growth, while politicians remain completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government - was unambiguous to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup - not to influence the austerity programmes, which were realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Ascended friends, who would reiterate that democracy would change if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe together with me, to believe Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us democracy, but that we may need a truly and miserable democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are painted, our future dster and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to inform you of an interesting contradiction, which currently threaten our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt of debt, which casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the debt of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his / Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"to invest a mountain of unused cash, which could be too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income could contribute to where it would be productive and income, which the humanity requires urgent, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the last 3 months in the USA, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 llion dollars, in all the prosperity manufacturing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, gas, equipment, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars sounds after a lot of money until one compares to the 5.1 trillion US dollars which at the same time did in the same countries and our financial institutions.</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, not equal in the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 years in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that would fail to kill the pessimism of investors."</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances to bring it to that oil-pus kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haired with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely curved capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are critical for the salvation of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a company form in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy was of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to prevent the significance of the athenic democracy due to these measures."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athenic democracy was and is that they were the working arms involved, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial to them the right to political co-determination in questions of the state bar."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which is very bright, she is quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy possible, and the democratic process was bound to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone was opened."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies has been present in our present democracies since the time, at which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy gradually emigrated by policymakers and she dismailed."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are not as much more as previously?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because they can be in the government today, and nevertheless, not in power, because the power from politics to the economy is woven and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haders with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's like a herd of carnivores, so sustainably the animals, of which they nourishes, decimated that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy which the politics grows so far. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the overall economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are frightened to donate the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" "demos" "(the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and the economy, and it would be better when the" Demos "maintains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms regain only a miracle like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working arms abouts!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by automating the Niedriglowing of automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will become higher, the extravagant summit, and the social conflicts more deeply, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and thereby make sure that we can change the reunited area, otherwise we can appear in a disease liable hyperautocracy that lets the film" matrix "like a documentation appear."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is therefore not whether the capitalism has brought the technical achievements that he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is used by a dystopia, similar to the" "star Trek", "or something that is used in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, or in a long-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks about the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what to do, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a brief few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which one gets money, while you work, and in which your capital is coming to you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not belong in it, and those who do not belong in it. no more exchange between capital and labour, and ultimately no major gaps among investment and asparagus, and ultimately no ruined twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries, in the interest of the entire human race."</seg>
<seg id="966">"they continue to be negotiated that the entire world trade in this currency will be traded -- we call it" "the cosmos", "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to trade deficit or trade overflow of the country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have it, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe to you is at the same time, in which she preferred people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesianese, global keynesianese."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we stand together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks for thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and the economy is... do not do so, technological development will generate such a massive decline of overall economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as" long term stagnation "."</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just as Hayek, therefore I am a libertary Marxist, and as Keynes, and so I am also completely wirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are also well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if one is not wirr, one does not think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner, you have clearly told what you think about the West's perspective."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy on the policy, while most of the area, the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, when I may say so provocative, China today resembles the British of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism and Liberals such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now proposing to do that which has done the West itself in the 19th century, called for hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listings were curious about your experience as a Minister of Finance Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I used that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the Eurozone a new beginning,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to self-sufficiency and to the lasting denial, that a massive sealing line proceeded through the eurozone, and continues to threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that this denial was revealed --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"to do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to be chosen."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, due to political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay a while, but when the changes occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change is you ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- harvesting...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who claimed for 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims, he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the money givers to find a common solution.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive officer at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a fixed-refreshment and describes himself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for giving the shows and content, the Amazon will produce."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-battling industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the evaluation runs from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"your show will be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" "Breaking bath", "" "Game of Thrones", "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, when you have looked at a season," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should you tell you what at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to be under" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the medium of labour, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time the Amazon that makes something so that Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he required success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas on TV shows and chooses an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows, and introduces them online where they can watch each person free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives things out for things out there, one still takes place?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when they look at these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are taking everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you look at, what parts one jumps, or once again to look at."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide on these data to make which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from this it arises the answer, and that is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom on four Republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do you know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House "," but it seems that not many will remember this show because it was not so good. "</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7,4 is and Alpha House laned at 7.5 -- so something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organising a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had together all the parts, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom on four senators, but rather a drama series on a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. thus exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works super for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic seemed to be somehow that it should work at all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when one collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mindete, what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so this is something frightening because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Is someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, this is even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided if a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"middle television TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite of the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produces the best results. this is not due to the fact that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The dates of the most sealed companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009 gave Google known that they can say thanks to data analysis outbreaks of flu, which may be said -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news stroke. the success culminated in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year round year by year until it suddenly no longer worked out,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows in decisions in the life of life -- on the work place, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"also I know a lot of difficulties with data. I work in the computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have identified some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly, do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a first place you can analyze this problem into its parts, so you can analyze the parts; as a result, you set the items together again to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but they are always two things: apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to crush a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to get the parts back together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all have it: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that is good when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete, even if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"for that reason I believe, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which otherwise they would not have been capable of. but the decision, how to take all these parts, and make it a show like" House of Cards "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used the data to control all their decisions, first as she chose TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool and not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get a reply. "most likely" -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will leave it later with a machine-demolition.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard on the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by doing much diplating, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is clumsy and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message that it still pays out to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks lovely.</seg>
