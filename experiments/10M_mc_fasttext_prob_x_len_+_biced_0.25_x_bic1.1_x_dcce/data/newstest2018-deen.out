Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards which change your sight to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where people should meet today .
&quot; a greeting , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is excav@@ ated . &quot;
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ edge reason of farmers .
the oldest official map estu@@ aries promotes exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when landing cards are not up to date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to get exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place instead of a locker road a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical land cards of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but this is precisely very conclu@@ sive . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and villages have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ ep@@ ts which one does not recognize as such .
&quot; in the great super@@ visible card , for cities and communities are more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine blades . &quot;
these were created according to the Bay@@ er@@ ase administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your Customer : Napoleon .
the French army established Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ eg@@ es with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops passed away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map .
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV drive the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; and thus the Bay@@ erische Government administration . &quot;
the case for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bav@@ arian State Library .
&quot; the comparison from the morning / today is an example of the state capital , as an example . &quot;
the city has spread in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
&quot; Send@@ ling was shared 21 years after creation of the map , thus 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader in the Bav@@ arian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the western park is seen , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in written form with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so called &quot; &quot; urine intake &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots occupy there today no more farmers - but small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant in Sun .
a large green surface stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 sw@@ ings of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the jungle leaf one reads in the area of the present district of A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the fan &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse &quot; one was once st@@ acked by people with madness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch .
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden , Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden , launched the establishment - that psychiat@@ r@@ ists , associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and for example , for instance , the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , was first place , later on 500 places was expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity will no longer be made - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there is since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ hospital in Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry in Germany . &quot;
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt is now meeting young people in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order received the building complex in 1920 and walked it into a youth home with training .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , we set up the children house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; based on the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as the main square , which was named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought forward by the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a greetings from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on April 5 , 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil law Group published travel insurance for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory to the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who is going to come into force by the state , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors , and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner to leave for travel through the state as a series of frag@@ mentary , imp@@ ure @-@ based incidents in the whole state occur and here , it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recent S &amp; D Act of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it people harder to win dis@@ crimin@@ ation , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , prompted the group to give up @-@ to @-@ date , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have injuries of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they will be assembled or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group held like rac@@ ist offen@@ ders against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under un@@ questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had taken any more during the journey through the state , and taken by Mis@@ sour@@ i in custody , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent edition of the Office of the General state @-@ General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , where it is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will last 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring it aside money or they know their relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i promised in 2015 100 of hate , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ reporting report of the F@@ BI , which the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel concerns for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration have been adopted , people are committed to protecting people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further edges of the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel statements are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry of other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ a@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliam@@ entary Group Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given itself a picture on site .
&quot; at the right dig@@ ging court of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the fisheries bacher CD@@ U are linked together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann has initially placed insights into its operation , in which he employs 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk @-@ kis@@ ses and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the aging of an alternative mark@@ er for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of fishing bach , he signed the crossover project as an &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot act on such a steep surface .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , much must be processed with the Motor@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ong@@ ated operation and posted it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he has no bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the de@@ ple@@ tion project and is happy to support the leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to support the farmers . &quot;
one hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could still be taken out for a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people working in agriculture and therefore think about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure surface area amounts to 40 hectares that can not be found until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded half over the leaders , a district carried out the municipality of Bas@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ de@@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
&quot; even for Peter White , there was also best food products . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ aff@@ geri@@ geri@@ ie ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state promotion of ordination .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the presence is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ signed conveyor .
&quot; in addition , the fun@@ nel surface may not be mis@@ sive ( Hang@@ ing about 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , for the fisheries management of Wei@@ dez@@ ek , 2018 is currently running out of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build slightly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface corresponds 35 hectares , the cold costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime transition is it when they start to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore , the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dras@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not take the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators could have made him yn@@ x when he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated . &quot;
the poem which you refer to that later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is right properly , but as he described it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your arms , / your pressed masses , which are longing for free to breathe , / den miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ful waste &quot; on our screen was better to see .
Miller committed not to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that she served a highly political act .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by showing in an used classical image , the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom . &quot;
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the feminine figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and there is himself a different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ators .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued 2010 that the American flame is coming into the world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
she is supposed to carry the F@@ ack@@ el of the freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something hit .
the significance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they had seen from the exhausted , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they need to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognise .
&quot; their tor@@ ch shall not enligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred , who is the only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
world championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ oted members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds yourself of a time when only two sten@@ tions belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states in the world championship will contribute a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of sh@@ ot@@ tic athletes was selected for London 2017 that will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland &quot; &quot; something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals for medals there , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is rather modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were sh@@ ot@@ table or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real sense , the E@@ ili@@ dh quite naturally caught , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth silver medal winning at their fifth World Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s country has so far been the best total number of athletes at the World Championship in the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ stre@@ ak mu@@ ir runs on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m run , is another flush , which was included in the British Team of Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle reminds himself of her first world Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was . &quot;
&quot; the Mann@@ er@@ ts chapters says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about team @-@ surrender is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour for me , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me , making it something really special for me &quot; , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise on Po@@ unds . &quot;
what my speech is concerned about ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics over Facebook : do not throw you a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the healing of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers were hit him because of all , from the internal policies up to its political principles . &quot;
he sh@@ im@@ ed in criticism of certain .
but he has not brought its critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; the freedom can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and mu@@ te , we will be guided as the sheep to the battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work on it , more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties had promised him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is an Republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary Hitler head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to unite with his voters and play his ha@@ il@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of individuals coming to the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees that are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post Office , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker &apos;s actions in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , the actions of the governor and argued that the comment of the comments was nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ water filled people , which reson@@ ates online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments was respectful , thoughtful , and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest sought the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; Law@@ yers Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to break down . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary section of the news &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place at the same theme , then they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors had been referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; pron@@ unciation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or a negative comment will be deleted .
&quot; it is a lot of clean@@ ers than in former time when one had done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders , to burn or burn demonstr@@ ators or prot@@ esters . &quot;
but this is exactly what exactly happens .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise his Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is desp@@ ised by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US @-@ district James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she appointed a vot@@ er of her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mailbox . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous Tro@@ lle .
&quot; the people who used pseudon@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , compl@@ ained its ministry , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of expression , opinion between various and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in domestic comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ d@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who was in the past year next door in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links up to the final class before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new au@@ stra@@ ort and acts as a tournament message in the name of the club green@@ ders and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is a di@@ lig@@ ament of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , the english E@@ ales was looking forward to defend a championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career , both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player in South@@ port was the player . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was in the year after I had won them , taken out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories come back from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year for the European Senior Tour comes back to the promotion on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel also this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf course .
I am glad about how far there has been .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ again . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six d@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew classic corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pulmon@@ ary per@@ sever@@ ing with passive smoke
in the past two decades less people are dying because of passive cancer .
&quot; to this result , scientists of the university clinics are Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , per year 16@@ 7 lungs are attributed to passive smoking &quot; , &quot; said Study Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved his own study on this topic in 1994 . &quot;
at that time there are still 400 lung cancer cases because of passive consuming a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
car@@ esses prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; lie within the time &quot; , &quot; said the leader of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the car@@ bure@@ tor , the situation is more complicated as suspected , as in the underground there is much embarrass@@ ment , which is not in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders the construction , poses a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red light and de@@ ple@@ r@@ it@@ ters has already been huge , &quot; &quot; tells Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the line buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p has been busy with working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i bo@@ ge@@ i dinner , they do not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai province Pap@@ ua , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai province Pap@@ ua , lays the house normally a sweet potato - local as a &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the shortened tu@@ ber , with eager , im@@ pass@@ able hands were extracted and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ rests - it has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work for example clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bu@@ cket in a dach@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to their fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is here usual .
&quot; of course , too late may be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink too heavy , and there are the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest should vote in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch dom@@ inion , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or jurisdictions . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from provincial capital Carolina to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo gardens , and out of shaft roofs , which were converted through ro@@ ost in various yellow shades . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is poor province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and alpha@@ bet rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , grass berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built in the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at the value of 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , who make sure that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens &apos;s powerful military is preserved . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military and units of between 1998 and 2004 paid nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this Golden G@@ ans and will be given mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ful .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal in 1970 @-@ 20 years have been referred to as the Asia @-@ Human Commission for genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police in the region had more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we value the all &quot; means &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ diocese of the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as non @-@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have ampli@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are changing from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ inen sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people are fighting here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to work . &quot;
&quot; it has the native pap@@ ua - the M@@ om M@@ ua ( the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
&quot; the Indones@@ ian state of Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ s as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised inequalities and violations of violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , there was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the sc@@ ared children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took attachment to her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , def@@ endants and smote the group with their poems , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard pressed that he fell into the Com@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building was set out at the nearby Government Commission and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Commissioner , to demand justice . &quot;
they were cerem@@ onial ceremony and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird @-@ bird @-@ im@@ it@@ ous - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to waste stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent to an internal spark : &quot; if the masses were more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got into my linear wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the gathered soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , as many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , who bears a name , the TI@@ ME in the dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ porters said that his officers wanted to only &quot; &quot; secure their station &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings were first filmed on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in his sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ ells the historical dis@@ states in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like this case immediately resolved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Minister of Security Minister Wir@@ anto in October 2016 , he made an extra@@ ordinarily court mechanism for the applause of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the extinction began almost immediately .
&quot; most injury occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
&quot; then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , it is governed by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , called the UN for crimes against humanity , said the more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody crimes of independence , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been bei@@ ge , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Pre@@ case . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such allegations with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ believers .
&quot; I was interviewed during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he was still living in fear years later .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I are afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk when he conf@@ is@@ cated in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
Ascen@@ ded villagers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office office .
&quot; the police said that the villagers threw stones on officers , who reacted to that by war@@ ting war@@ ts . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot on the crowd and a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who was in close proximity to the hospital and a witness , as the injured was delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an in@@ ruin of the Indones@@ ian government for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal seas , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the pap@@ ua by using spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai during the last few years , under the pretext of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaves .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a cost only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ien ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic inequalities have grown between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; beyond that , restrictions on the reporting of international media are stra@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is Elec@@ tions to raise the restrictions of reporting to increase transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report by In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens uncertain provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains limited to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March called for six Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ els and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the speaker of the Indones@@ ian Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group , and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights incidents . &quot;
the local people want to take note of that more foreign governments accept this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Off@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but staying anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory army , in impover@@ ished education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other pap@@ ua , see her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ation led to the last symbolic act of the fool : the gul@@ f of a sacrifice was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with established head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire found on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that occurs in just two years through the high @-@ house , which makes it accidental to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with fire@@ places and to the cry of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; told a inhabitants who named his name as George An@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) changed the fire and cool the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodations for those affected .
the incident can answer questions about the safety of materials that are used throughout the world in areas of skyscrapers all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the cl@@ amping , the external cover to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain the police said , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June was to have contributed to the rapid spread of a meeting in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) is through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , this city was not supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single only on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third @-@ majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but even therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics will remain the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the status .
&quot; at all , not only to vote was before the proposal that the finale was made in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists are in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future in the first round of the host &apos;s right .
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements for training courses are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings to bot@@ tom@@ ed items into the plane , there is a survey of survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among passengers are aware that more than 20 percent are aware of over 20 percent , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft as they accidentally dec@@ ayed kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted , they had late found that they have been ab@@ used with bul@@ b weapons , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted more than 1,000 people - who was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ter Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents that they were kno@@ w@@ ingly tried with something to fly , which was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that have been visi@@ oned by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent made , knowing items with blades carried through the security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they would have rep@@ lic@@ ated drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , it asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many watched smug@@ gling were brought in due to airport security and how many it could have done . &quot;
&quot; it is not a surprise that the people who carry the most smug@@ gling smug@@ gling or un@@ wis@@ s@@ ingly - through the security , those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids may take them or how much of it .
so it is not a surprise that the largest amount of those produced by the T@@ SA were established by the T@@ SA .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could see books as a smug@@ gling ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is there : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ ght@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has hitherto hit that part of the customer has re@@ withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has betrayed a different , less smooth number for the first quarter of the recent quarterly assessment : the cancellations with the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
Mus@@ k often applied with more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose delivery begins .
&quot; now Mus@@ k Mus@@ k is a : from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn again . &quot;
critics always pointed out that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US $ 1000 dollars and in the United States 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations made up , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of so far approximately twelve percent of all orders might be a problem , the Tes@@ la chef does not believe . &quot;
its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth aim is not in demand but on the production side .
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 should be put together - all models together - 500,000 , 2020 , a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , a day of 1800 reservations are currently being added . &quot;
&quot; who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 , may at the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never before , in practice , without larger inter@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
many experts question that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the dis@@ integration of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent in@@ satisfied customers to read in swe@@ ars . &quot;
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt draws back to the rules of the Obama @-@ Era on reducing emissions back
&quot; one day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the boss of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era , to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards more effective than previous administration . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Employment Court .
&quot; this is a deadline , which ran down on October 1st for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ her@@ ing o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would be hesit@@ ant to give more time to his authority , to study the plan and avoid getting into local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt who had been pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long period of reliable opposition to environmental regulations .
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt was repeated repeatedly to block or delay , to block or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the plot of regulatory back agenda .
&quot; last month , a German Chancellor in Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt published the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states , due to the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standard ampli@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA has often maintained the deadlines for the implementation and then waited for the implementation of activity groups and others , and in an agreement set out the appointment for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that there is us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ ordin@@ ates &quot; to make sure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for more comprehensive re@@ design of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; in the last month , a recent month approved law@@ suits should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Consul@@ ate General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had compl@@ ained EPA in this week , the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : at the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen , on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
saving and preserving the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ers to their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i emphasises : &quot; it is a unique village of village . &quot;
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ cap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Ur@@ als &apos; Day , including the church &quot; &quot; Mag@@ g@@ tei &quot; &quot; by Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; the wording of the certificate , according to the former parish church , except the single rec@@ tory church , also belonged to a splendid farm that belonged to the church or pat@@ ron@@ age and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ anian Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the majestic settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from time around the year 1600 under@@ mines these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was created from the early medieval peculiarities .
&quot; a Lord who built a church , built and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ church . &quot;
connected to this was the right to use a priest or the bishop to propose a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were available in the church and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke first appeared in the first time in 16@@ 92 , but it was later released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of windows were stolen and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was in@@ dense .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they jour@@ ne@@ yed the pul@@ pit and the church turns out and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church dro@@ wned 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery served as the last resting area for the dead of hearing @-@ speaking people . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the Kir@@ k@@ ur@@ m could be left .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm ra@@ ined a storm and the half rus@@ hed .
&quot; in order to prevent an evil , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only now available Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em , from the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ ker Rent@@ als &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius @-@ plant . &quot;
&quot; as an organizer , invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ts on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words about Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .
local @-@ ste@@ er Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 PM .
on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the seren@@ ade there is a um@@ trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , the organizer set out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only at dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to have many supporters to maintain the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of importance for tum@@ bler and hearing @-@ speaking .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ ts are particularly committed to home care such as Seren@@ ade Organ@@ ator Walter Martin@@ i .
society wants to examine permission of Win@@ dr@@ apes
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the country &apos;s council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has been urged to increase Land@@ betra@@ yal Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) , his authorization to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to swal@@ lows a wind@@ power concentration zone have existed . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration zone also causes a exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city area . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape should prevent . &quot;
&quot; the town of quad@@ ran@@ s had a second wind power centre in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but who had decided to achieve a second wind turbine zone in the bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but who had not approved the District government Düsseldorf , because of a mould . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirement , the shared per@@ tin@@ ent per@@ tin@@ ent is still un@@ certain@@ ed and therefore said , &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council re@@ decided again the wind centre zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval from the District government is still pending .
&quot; erotic : &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines . &quot;
the circle confirms the entry of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been made since past week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a spokes@@ person . &quot;
the circle takes her on the occasion to check the matter once again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view of the ongoing process at the Board of Directors , the circle wanted to give itself not content to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four per 200 meters high . &quot;
&quot; already last year the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , pl@@ ot@@ ted contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain closed . &quot;
&quot; with construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to around one @-@ fifth of the electricity demands of all quad@@ sen@@ ces households . &quot;
the NE@@ W will invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; in the last summer there were four wind turbines for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach Pal@@ enberg , Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cras@@ hes together : Ms. dies in a terrible accident
an aw@@ ful traffic accident is suitable on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Low @-@ W@@ m@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman has been fatal thereby .
two other people were slightly injured .
the provincial road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to the police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went with her car under the accompanying lift with their 53 @-@ year mother as companion person to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and distributors plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , the city of Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ ine and people from the region are to discover shopping in the city center in September . &quot;
&quot; the trade show , and the city administration , want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract the residents to the downtown . &quot;
&quot; as the Chairman of the Business Conference , Christian king , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend , the customers want to sensi@@ tise the customers , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; planned is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the downtown to &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night @-@ Shopp@@ en &quot; &quot; are to invite . &quot;
the goals are not only on the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , who point out the weekend weekend , so Christian king . &quot;
city administration and commercial enterprises cooperate with the industrial and commercial chamber .
&quot; with this , the trade show and the city enter into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest with its selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , in order to move to the active participation . &quot;
&quot; attractive offers on Saturday and ren@@ oun@@ cement of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should become new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; however , many natives could have lost the inner city when shopping from a glance . &quot;
&quot; in the end , they must all contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and Ver@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; it landed , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y which was partly spread , King had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ i , leader of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that on the national third &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; day , first five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and lead . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le for the appreciation of local trade promote and its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also make sure that every citizen can influence his direct environment themselves with his department .

tr@@ ump set after penetr@@ ated tran@@ scri@@ bed by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican president Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , listen to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compl@@ ained him because he had denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; This can not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ amp , Mexico for the project . &quot;
&quot; tran@@ scri@@ bed his first attempt with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m , which were also published and revealed a tense exchange . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. sne@@ ak said that trading for the US to emigr@@ ate to Australia , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the funeral on the trade , which was sent by the Obama administration to take him as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; , &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he said Mr. sne@@ ak , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford mass@@ acres : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and r@@ umped on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men entered the bridge to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle aged in a needle @-@ strike - took a long train to his ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brun@@ t of the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
cry out the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on 22 July , was only a post . &quot;
&quot; but when then a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 Citiz@@ enship was coming back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was charged because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps to help the organization of post . &quot;
&quot; it is a black@@ out on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Congress of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to act , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a cour@@ tro@@ wel about the suffering of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI , who were received by the N@@ BC News were more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ es in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects stay on the open on the open feet , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice ruled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to reject their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach after details of the F@@ BI of the black colo@@ cation , Roger Mal@@ com is a white owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she was holding not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to free from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her C@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they moved away from the prison and then the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b moved the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; says a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a comb@@ ative between state and local law which was not only involved in the morning , and the identity of witnesses has promised . &quot;
Broo@@ ks also formulated to be gorgeous .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent mass@@ acres , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and let you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual post of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , revealing , and is based in a kind of deep racism , that many believe in America does not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and see even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are then confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship to you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I did through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lau@@ ghed , as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview over the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss @-@ cl@@ ans for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the brightness of H@@ ester and wat@@ ered him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- , win@@ ded from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona bl@@ ur@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone will break ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lau@@ ghing .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people have said that &apos; n --- &apos; .
&quot; but , wit@@ zel@@ te one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly the energy in the space , a feeling of comra@@ des@@ hip replaces the discomfort replaced . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funeral gar@@ ment , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads bil@@ lie holidays sav@@ vy &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many coming just the road . &quot;
&quot; they experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as &apos;s pressing moisture , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point the mor@@ de remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de is found , the air turns out to the air . &quot;
&quot; if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes I would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope off and wi@@ pe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks into their poor crying together with the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience goes together with the actors for dinner .
at a table ch@@ opped a white pair from Atlanta stimulated about the post@@ cards with a black couple that they have just met .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought to find words , which feeling the performance has left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people to come to look like yourself and who do this because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still goes on , she added , &quot; today , the only police @-@ shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks is in his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance over the next year .
&quot; the post office is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who did not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &apos; was the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ or@@ f sets out on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ storey scenery . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) , op@@ tionally shows a s@@ hab@@ est street corner with a mas@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ est and Ela@@ est &quot; &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhin@@ ocer@@ os posi@@ a more posi@@ tional , or alternatively an i@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; Gest@@ ap@@ tured oil f@@ ässer is remembering Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that runs through his &quot; ring &quot; of production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ killer sang - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ör@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ i@@ ously as already in the &quot; R@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; kne@@ eled them Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ren in Hollywood Man@@ ier a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ ery Ha@@ gen which surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ wei@@ gh@@ er .
&quot; brutal the scene , as he ar@@ gues . &quot;
later there must also be Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; stor@@ eys are celebrated , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ vin@@ ent Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself and the hands for Merkel @-@ smo@@ ked form@@ ulate . &quot;
&quot; large applause there are for the Fest@@ spiel@@ chester , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in le@@ ft@@ able leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ or@@ f and his representative .
&quot; he had to leave 2013 still a ball concert over itself , there were five years later big j@@ ubil@@ ations , where the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; Ru@@ fe went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to be pleased about it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience made it not only a form of peace with Cast@@ or@@ f , but it has also grown an understanding of the point of view . &quot;
I pull a positive reset army .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their Volun@@ te@@ er year equal to several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have worked at school already in open entirety .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum which I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteers . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I did wear .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say successfully . &quot;
I recognized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people working .
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; take a social year , there you can see an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point too , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I am going to start my studies in social beings during the winter semester .
&quot; I will study a dual study , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studi@@ ere in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different types of applications ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very vari@@ abel . &quot;
it will probably always be on where to make his FS@@ J .
&quot; it is possible to make it work from Alter@@ sheim to youth , in all possible fac@@ ets of social work . &quot;
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly the right thing that has mat@@ ured me . &quot;
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about st@@ ati@@ ken up . &quot;
one always has a lot of other people in the head which each have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , if a teen@@ ager , who has been caught out of the family - you must always go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have a touch @-@ door ?
quantity : I do not have the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .

five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been injured the Declaration of Nato .
&quot; according to the case in the case of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , there were also three civilians . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence of violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday the su@@ icide attacks two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , the explosion was done on Thursday night , as a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all calculations are in a stable state and are treated in the US @-@ military hospital at Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , of which 20 % are in the capital . &quot;

&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g @-@ rule by means of law@@ suits
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama by delay , of which the states are oblig@@ ated to com@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 States compl@@ ained the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone specifications 2015 , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and to respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which they must be measured in a part of the country of contam@@ in@@ ating standards - in order to delay more stringent air quality standards - in order to delay a year up to October 2018 .
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , ran@@ ged on Tuesday law@@ suit , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental conditions , which has imposed former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which aims to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and reserves groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; &quot; which can reduce the lung function &quot; &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
community of community wants a common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two counterparts , the com@@ der@@ at of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ king decides the establishment of a common room in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing property was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to be , until the so far of the Church &apos;s Church , is still standing in the community , there is now no planning event for the project by a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with after 70 square meters of space available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the community council acts as a meeting point for such a common room , not only as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ viable housing , but openly in the community . &quot;
&quot; for example , the word made from the &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; the decision is made by providing funding for the current budget already last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
the decision @-@ making proposal sees to signal the investor to signal that in this respect there is no bil@@ le@@ - to sign@@ alling it in this respect - as also P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the risk of ambient - and the construction of economic power is possible .
&quot; need@@ less , so not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer means , be this supplement . &quot;
when &apos;s helps : unanim@@ ous thing happens to the body .
it is not that easy to deal with the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one does not come forward to the common room in the window , they say : &quot; I do hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger also speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it is behind it a covered sub @-@ prevention in any case of high @-@ level or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area , one does not give a grant , but get a real , in the branch market , the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request , to address the proposed proposal accordingly , will find three advocates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two counterparts in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ized : &quot; &quot; when we put the decision so , we make a huge step to close a giant @-@ gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

the last was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .

hiking in Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
&quot; in the har@@ z the first &quot; &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planning the club Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to the information needs of many hard@@ ships , she called . &quot;
&quot; he connecting nature , science , movement and sports performance . &quot;
members want to set up the planned route along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning to be &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations to five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in@@ question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards are to be supple@@ mented by Internet .
&quot; therefore , at the site choice , a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ pf@@ ad , the spect@@ ator experience much of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars different colors would have or why a star would have more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; in which constellation will be conve@@ yed , in which constellation can be seen a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
the association has been operating in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; according to the Federal National Park , the location of the Federal National Park Har@@ z is one of the six most dark regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda @-@ galaxy clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the UNI @-@ city since 2003 there have been an initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen on initiative such as the planned star@@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary weg .
&quot; starting before Geb@@ res@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads away with its st@@ els up to the Hain@@ berg and the observatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ards ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the St@@ els with the individual planets including of the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly placed in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks such a bul@@ let of 6.5 mm in diameter while the exact 75 meters away is about 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the entire distance of the planetary we@@ arer is good four kilometers .
&quot; while the light of sun is needed from sun to Plu@@ to , you need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern would still last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time in discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should be in a collision event to staged the most exciting pit battle in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;

&quot; according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by an agre@@ eable decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , they are both fighters of the top five Po@@ und for Po@@ und &apos;s List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How does it go to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko defended his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order &quot; . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down on light weight .

four last to the tyre board
in an accident on the A@@ 7 afternoon four people were severely injured on the Thursday afternoon .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock is likely to be executed shortly after the connection of the Market market , presumably after a tire check control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger bo@@ wed right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he struck himself over and then lying on the roof in the founder . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last due to the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left strip was passing by the accident . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Trinity &quot; &quot; works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the end of the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the immune system in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , would not be the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defence of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains , the three @-@ term chain shall also be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a Fre@@ isto@@ ß want the Fort@@ ress not even more f@@ aint .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no longer has to be on line with Michael ( R@@ ensing ) . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better assigned to the experience in preparation with the tri@@ er@@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain chain . &quot;
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , yet Hoffmann is his cause for sure , &quot; because we just got in the three @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; it is a prerequisite for us , but that we are even better harmon@@ ising and not to do so many abor@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , however , you can talk about a mis@@ chosen starting from a mis@@ leading start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season . &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; start the season after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken prematurely because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now you can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her since they could not have a heavy and complete play like Fort@@ una against an ascension favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests from the Rhein@@ land go on Sunday to the encounter in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e , on Sunday . &quot;
&quot; that we carry them away , just because we have the right to come among the first distress , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ nonsense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is only positive against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as boss . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ tly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and thus Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ review tests published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzles in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started with performing the tests last year .
&quot; they are to make more precise during the asylum procedure , after the assessment of the age of the age of the Swedish migration ( migration ) due to mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees , which were inferi@@ or . &quot;
&quot; up to date , Migr@@ ations 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been printed and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older than in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person might be 18 years or older .
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person might be under 18 years old .
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see any big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has gone over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there 4@@ 42 cases give the &quot; suggest that the examinations are 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , it presented that in 243 this cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment assessment , in the x @-@ ray photographs of Wis@@ dom and MRT recordings of Kni@@ eg@@ els are being analysed , which then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson published by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being able to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes had been installed on the bridge at the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ily , builder at the department of road and traffic in the governing board of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three re@@ development bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is intended for October and is sure that the schedule is observed .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three components are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance to the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bro@@ wn@@ cap . &quot;
this is a boundary that is used as a business path .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , on Friday a 2,@@ 20 meters wide bridge cap should be used . &quot;
then the pedestrian went out .
&quot; it is special that it is about production , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented Br@@ ück@@ ers .
particular finger@@ tips has necess@@ it@@ ated the wiring of cables through the building plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass of fibre , which many companies are connected to . &quot;
the residents were informed about the projects in advance of the work by hand@@ writing about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cancer had to be fired . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building building and the collection , in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; is fully locked . &quot;
the costs for the three bro@@ wn@@ ings amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t come as often that parties prefer to draw , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcano ei@@ fel parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows in this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell invites to the poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known name to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top priority for the Bundestag on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Deputy Chairman of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who have been on site already hours before the start of the event , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place in the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A world and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , really happy : &quot; great how many people come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him to . &quot;
&quot; the police have prevented many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all at the station which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how is the Af@@ D arrived at Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcano an@@ fel , he has been doing such an event and got the surcharge . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built @-@ in Laur@@ enti@@ us cherry , there were not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; in view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is what it does : against 20 o &apos;clock , the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , in the city hall several speakers , including the Rhine @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young . &quot;

&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; hits a classic German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both Sol@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have played Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European peak orches@@ tras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ching the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both are united , not only to cross boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; this sounds Johann Sebastian Bach with both Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ olo@@ ge@@ ars N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classical , jazz and the free games to an intrigu@@ ing whole art@@ works . &quot;

Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I want to try everything &quot; so Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart completely openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; when I slept in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ ric stars was that of her &quot; &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who was ultimately bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine &quot; -@@ magazine &quot; : &quot; I was seriously engaged in love that I have done . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; according to their separation , Kr@@ isten existed to be bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , they suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , when they prefer to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really got me very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven , I said the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I felt really attacked and ashamed .
now I look back and think about : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they do not like to live their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and the angry me .
&quot; and maybe some call me to be anchor , but I don &apos;t like it to justify myself all the public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and much to think ... today , I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; said Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke a major announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice is not the democratic candidate , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes presents that he possesses coal mines in five states , and from his father have inherited a coal business . &quot;
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday gave an explanation in which it said , &quot; The Party metabolism of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather be more likely to be working towards us to make our land great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive , internal message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e lo@@ bt &quot; &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; &quot; Russian sorry for dop@@ ing &quot;
&quot; the world leader of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a D@@ oping scandal , but he was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the eve of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport correctly and that he was determined to fight for the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut off at competitions - and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for maintaining the Forbidden in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) reference to nation@@ alised D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that she experienced some rather hot times , and will do anything to make sure the Federation is newly designed . &quot;
&quot; said Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; happy &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninete@@ en Russian athletes will begin at the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ sters World Championships , which begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; threats tests are still inadequate and processed coaches are still working freely , he said Re@@ porters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries for in Mali stri@@ ved soldiers
&quot; at a funeral party in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ian Frit@@ z@@ lar around 1,000 people of the two were thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety measures .
&quot; to still un@@ resolved , Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; it described the two revers@@ ed drivers , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we betra@@ y@@ eth us against this highest sacrifice that they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she declared . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old rod sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday before a week in the West African Mali .
her sister were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a death @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at the mid@@ day , only the members of the church took place in the church . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral party started in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ s of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; sad@@ ness , ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing in arm to the soles . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers saw the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defence in the Le@@ yen signed the reverse soldiers as a &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ anic .
the rod sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann have built the flight operation of the Kampf@@ h@@ ub@@ ber tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six educated tiger @-@ pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then it would not have been mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts at the UN mission in Mali did not prove to be dangerous at the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high significance for a country , from which we are separated only through two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the smi@@ ths were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are sh@@ ado@@ wed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
prince Hen@@ rik does not want to a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by his wife . &quot;
the shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal cal@@ ar is set in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already created a coff@@ op@@ ha@@ g for both of them .
&quot; the queen agreed with the decision of her husband , it was given further in the communication . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik be buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home country .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a blast from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to have King .
in 2016 he went reti@@ re and also puts the title &quot; prin@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark does not have the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , said L@@ ene Ballet , the chief pre@@ occupation of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately , be unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked at the Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people had always flo@@ wn , prince Hen@@ rik had always had a heavy stand for the roofs of the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , dam@@ s instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and have the reputation of being the brand soci@@ alistic intellectuals , I could not hope to hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; rainf@@ all Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is contrary to the loss of red @-@ green governance for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to go back . &quot;
&quot; because on Friday , the vote spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising resignation of a Green Parliam@@ entary Group in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the day @-@ day election lost the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover for its scarce @-@ vote majority in the parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ ung@@ be@@ founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she told her on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ frac@@ tion@@ chief Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend her to her .
&quot; that would have CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the German @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship is vice versa .
the new landing day is elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the country &apos;s day is as fast as possible to eliminate his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through her further action .
the country &apos;s state also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Day draws confidence and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be tested legally clean , &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot;
one will discuss in peace all the questions when they are legally tested .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &quot; , &quot; but something curve . &quot;
the politician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was described as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Greens called for the down@@ time dep@@ u@@ ties to the return of their country days .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has received her country tag@@ and@@ at that has received it over the green state , shared with immediate effect , &quot; shared the Landes@@ leader Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
they have deliberately decided to guide no pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even before the background , that there were no content @-@ differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the crossing of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal President of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , to quickly choose the day of land . &quot;
&quot; the resignation of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority . &quot;
&quot; the political leader &quot; &quot; in her final van@@ ity &quot; &quot; and in her cheer@@ fulness her personal interests in front of the good of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ sachsen this dirty in@@ tri@@ b@@ ling play , and tries to beat out of political capital . &quot;
precip@@ itation ( CD@@ U ) commander Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Members to include El@@ ke T@@ west into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ west before , with personal career opportunities to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the Sunday election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strongest power , SPD , and Greens had a hau@@ ghty @-@ thin majority in the day of a voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in the interview - How to protect us from Gi@@ f@@ ists , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is present in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt is how the consumer can protect against poison@@ ous eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food maintenance .de , the federal states each have the latest information on the eggs of the eggs @-@ Char@@ ge . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di will take over the best of crisis reaction - all the eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the advent of the Federal Minister of Minister is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately opened up and there is the disclosure of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers bear the concern that the sold @-@ selling products are traffic @-@ capable and health @-@ uniform .
&quot; if at eggs of the back@@ load content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exceeded , these are non @-@ traffic . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs however can be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after completion of knowledge the production companies does not meet any immediate guilt .
&quot; rather , it must be expected because of mut@@ ation illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little controversy in the harvest .
is there only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive responsibility ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth is also part of that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; especially therefore , there are a consistent clarification of such activities and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secutor in the cases where crimes can be obtained , are crucial . &quot;
I have already stated several times that I expect a complete explanation of the responsible authorities of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m with food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and transportation foods exclusively .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are rightly outra@@ geous . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ ed funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of living foods is not acceptable , and needs to be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistent on all levels and work with high pressure .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic facts will be solved quickly and incomplete .
how the financial rules of Football to Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules to prevent ins@@ isted expenditure of European football , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s World football transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will be still coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were called in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ymers has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has EUR 2@@ 22 million ( 26@@ 2 million ) , to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with certainty , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mist@@ ress of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may apply for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but must be controlled with allo@@ ping sources that enable the Bre@@ ak @-@ even point in their on the soccer @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs that have taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and cr@@ acked , to ruin when banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P made up of concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel demo@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally bought in Chelsea in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ supply period , which runs up to 2018 , clubs can take into amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although PLA@@ ini 2015 is fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a cash of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the Mann@@ er@@ ts members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 was limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to over@@ list their financial supervision by offering their revenues by companies , who are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cataly@@ tic company could exceed the PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as a legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ SA was established by the Qatar &apos;s Tourism Authority . &quot;
it has been reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could arrive in Qatar about payments by the World Cup Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will become ambassador and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could easily find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even awake to consider each attempt to deal with the rules .
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , summ@@ ed on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million Euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ting sales . &quot;
the association goes out that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s way@@ side by asser@@ ting that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; funded D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Kat@@ ars the latter owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association owned by an American sport Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which co @-@ financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has a society , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play , because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has been made for the Swiss .
now the s@@ wis@@ s cooperation faces a possible end : the airline writes the contract anew .
&quot; Swiss @-@ speaking in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line in the first half of 2018 will join a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white Scho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ ules distributed to 14 grams per year the passenger ladder before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to make any information about the cost .
&quot; industry in@@ sider value the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is all the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious contract .
&quot; how many applicants are given in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come to question .
&quot; according to the newspaper &apos;s newspaper , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty on the spring of 2018 . &quot;
for the SD@@ A major Swiss Cho@@ colate has not been available for an opinion .
chocolate tablets are distributed Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss treaty closed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo conducted Swiss before two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class with goodies will be pampered in the Business Class nas@@ ties passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd lob@@ or ( it contained a original story for a promising D@@ ose vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; driving down on the core of the gig - actor @-@ middle aged play vacc@@ inated children , who will grow - they nevertheless won the im@@ possibility to get back to the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years of L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting @-@ known principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker @-@ films of the 90 @-@ ies as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand which the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point st@@ ö@@ bert a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious c@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) is still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant p@@ lot in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ founded impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the Ex@@ courses of the best part of the franchise are .
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , whose former Big Man @-@ on Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of accidental ins@@ ane that could take this franchise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I take as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist , &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; whose last scene will show the gang , as she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ battle @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; headed by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created Com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a Romanian drama for ei@@ ghty years with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main rolls - a hard sc@@ ot@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ ó@@ i - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gig to look ( the police spends the time to watch chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ci Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - makes the voice out for a constant game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a dou@@ bt@@ ful propaganda Dr@@ amas - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; at six long episodes , it goes down , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which was re@@ activated on a lower length , could be able to provide its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re , because Gregor and Io@@ sef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men that is a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the widest communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a money .
&quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator is not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history , and with its own . &quot;
blow against drugs in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart visited numerous objects , as the pro@@ secutor Kon@@ stanz on Friday ended . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 15 , 15 for the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and already arrested against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , officials presented some marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , arms of arms as well as several hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands . &quot;
at times of simultaneous swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warrant .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
the action was involved in Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia will be organised crime against crime , heavy violence , attempted murder and rob@@ bery and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secutor of Constance is determined against the organised drug trading in the South German region since summer 2016 . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secutor &apos;s government in Constance and Palermo , an intermedi@@ ary exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the major use on the Wednesday morning also has been accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the investigations of the investigations , of all the Italian national organisations - and with a relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; even an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , in the early morning several sh@@ uts were fired in a restaurant , should be expected to enter the bank account . &quot;
way compl@@ aining large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; data from citizens who should not show that &quot; : in a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant shortcomings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has taken attention to a media report , according to major gaps in the Aus@@ centr@@ alised register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis that &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the property , 10 million people are captured with foreign citizenship , including around 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will be managed by some 600 foreigners authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts have not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in single cases , data of 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who are long no longer life or from citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer should arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can slow down re@@ posit@@ ors , &quot; says the report to further . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of out@@ going people , it covers an EU citizen that would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; however , such false orders were led to a distorted debate on how to deal with the external discussion , it is therefore said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government began to send refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy if they have travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is derived from an internal paper of the Federal Republic of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re@@ er Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , however , the BAM@@ F lead such proceedings &quot; regarding families with children with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper among the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for the refugees of the EU to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if an Migr@@ ant travels to another EU country , this state can send it to the departure country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason now , the office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children has increased substantially in Italy . &quot;
Italy provided for the reception and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these commitments for adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would send refugees back in the context of the Dublin agreement . &quot;
&quot; the domestic spokes@@ man in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ mes because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful recording conditions and a haz@@ ard of the child . &quot;
second results are achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people provided the blood of blood service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; all ahead of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , which in the meantime 100 donations have been divided by 50 lit@@ res of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally crus@@ hed the church in the session of the Municipal Council , the multi @-@ time willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we form@@ ulate the donations that make their blood available to strangers , nor un@@ selfish , &quot; &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ or helps several people , &quot; explained the circle leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the con@@ ser@@ ven will cr@@ ush in their components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three persons could benefit from a blood@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions being carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ors the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ roundabout . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change into the theatre released a few years ago to higher subscri@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Met@@ a Um@@ ma , were awarded for 50 entries . &quot;
&quot; half as many missed Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ wimm@@ ers , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their habitat . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep the interest rates in 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to be announced later , that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and mi@@ tigation of inflation , the spec@@ ulations have increased over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; than they assume interest rates on family income in the middle of a ampli@@ fied pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the European Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has increased support for an increase in increase . &quot;
&quot; in her four @-@ annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years Z@@ inser@@ tions would be necessary to breed the inflation of the Bre@@ xit and she said that the borro@@ wing may have to rise more than expected to the financial markets .
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s Business Unit , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide financial resources for banks , even though said that they will be available 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the Bank : &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remain weak , as pressure on real income of households continues to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates repeated them , that &quot; a certain amount of monetary policy &quot; is needed to cooling inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
markets currently predicted the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; the Bank stressed , however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would be limited . &quot;
&quot; the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year stand in comparison to those in May predicted 1.9 % , and 1,7 % . &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0,5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ continued growth pay the increasing expectations on an cement increase and GDP increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % .
&quot; growth will be expected in the third quarter , although it will be easily recover after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ day increases , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first even worse before they will be repaired . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent income in the coming years &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will recover considerably at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , resulting in a part of lower consumption spending . &quot;
&quot; a year after lowering the interest rates comes to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pot . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably be four years until this will get the prices and the economy completely .
&quot; before the last judgment of the Bank the call for interest rates was increasing , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , taking three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has fallen in June last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to attract them in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; fully &quot; to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ orium Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the shorter back@@ rest of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive as the len@@ ders want to search for shops , and would like to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
the market looks especially good for those with which the existing de@@ als are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular .
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transforming HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to intercourse income pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at risk of around 86 percent , now supplied from the health service to a first three @-@ year study of 10,000 people . &quot;
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Justice confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court after the Court of Justice in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; the Chess Federation announced on Thursday was being welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of April 2018 . &quot;
predic@@ tive pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV compounds that are taken in front of sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduced HIV transmission with infectious endangered endangered endangered .
to take Pr@@ EP in front of sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medication in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
&quot; to those who come to question for treatment , belong gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , the appropriate participants identified , who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a medical physician may also opt for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of drugs in this week after an international competitive .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by creating clinical evidence , as it is targeted at large scale , taken and implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in which more than three decades continued progress in addressing one of mankind &apos;s biggest health challenges .
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted at needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not subject to a hearing with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is rapidly carried out throughout the country and that no one has left the risk of HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was made , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to monthly delays and hesit@@ ant conversion through the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ational this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect persons that are infected with HIV , and that we will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designers @-@ tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ igned 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne her bags did not packed and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I love me in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room @-@ estate with a curved layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine to make the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she asked the architectural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not only a development , but also a place for the life of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the blan@@ ket was not big enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative to solve the pres@@ et .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were over each other , without having to settle . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height above or down . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms at full height - with lots of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic coupling window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored Gold@@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination put the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short basket is mir@@ r@@ ored to leave him longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the sp@@ ies feels like a window into a different room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious , so it when you push the door , very easily g@@ vert . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever usage of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form a real estate will arise and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the ground floor , and at the same time use high quality materials which give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , says Er@@ fan . &quot;
you do not ad@@ minister yourself into the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite funny .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for an 500 million US @-@ dollar property asylum
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the biggest real estate imperi@@ en Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business should be divided into . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers Anna possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since 1973 the family bought a business in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded the West@@ co Je@@ ans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot;
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt @-@ Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in has described col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator , and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the firm and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; it states that this means that Col@@ labor@@ ine &apos;s property is worth $ 3@@ 16 million , and Paul has tot@@ aled millions of dollars in the value of 17@@ 6 million . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has been proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the experts proposed by Col@@ in have left him with the left , which I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote 2015 in a first monkey av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several times . &quot;
the brothers also struggle to control the existing business - how Paul claimed him to be excluded .
&quot; Col@@ in argued , this is not true , but casts Paul before , some possessions in competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property in which in the col@@ on the first je@@ ans of the family opened .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to her sons . &quot;
Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court ; wrote her .
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid at the end of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has held itself very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of the television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I really can not say much &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain and to pull our family name by the courts , he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted to say that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new rod chief plans to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new house chief of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the head on a more equ@@ itable course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , who met his first working day at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff , that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in writing - because the president would make better choices if he would get good information . &quot;
&quot; wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed , by monitoring his media di@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed due to an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to convince , said the former election advis@@ er Sam Nun@@ berg in February compared to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to hold out that &quot; the key , Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit consists in control , according to six former election officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter is ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps this struggle officer might know something which we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps t@@ we@@ ets would have included even more ig@@ ni@@ ers without their interventions .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
&quot; if his staff has taken it some time , the trouble of him has to hold away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevent it to prevent Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people merge together from competing parties , and again trying to move their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that could possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this history - reported in May on the preference of consultants to lead the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can respond to negative press sections , especially those with def@@ ective le@@ aps , and that he will find out how these come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone found the vice @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the vice @-@ pro@@ vocation rod in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he was expressed in the past , and vo@@ wed them in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ makers added that the then Staff chief Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his consultants still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make &apos;s mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched criminals get a post of Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hoped for . &quot;
the police in all over Europe ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to the escape on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the sought @-@ brakes are not well @-@ known , are evidence from the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows on the &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many buzz on holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , it has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ations , more than 2.5 million times this was seen . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online gestures could be arrested until now , at least eleven of which are based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house @-@ owner of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on war @-@ foot which have negotiated one of the community @-@ drawn dit@@ ch to re@@ claim a field before their men &apos;s houses .
the travelers have their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; million@@ th row . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May , but not out@@ stretched out by one of the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tactical group found a gap in the defensive systems and put its cars by a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; ra@@ ging inhabitants have ur@@ passed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said that it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are sent there by Bentley He@@ ath when they cast stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were moved in May there and are now back .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move with it , by going long sub@@ instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common dest@@ in@@ ies if the Council cannot stop it even .
&quot; an fellow who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have been increased this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area .
&quot; said a spokes@@ person on Soli@@ h@@ ull : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
&quot; to support our flexibility collection , it is very important that as many residents know an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
out of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the district of Birken@@ hof by the then ambience operating company , the company was located about 30 000 nights per year and also revenues by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of a dramatic rise in the numbers of refugees , which came into the county , the hotel building offered as a collective accommodation , what was provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not un@@ disputed at that time .
&quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois masters Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the location of O@@ ss@@ wald , and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the Group of Lu@@ isen@@ Hotels with Head of Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad men .
&quot; you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing before the entrance , and when the house enters the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation works will be made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were ri@@ pped out , blankets to be built , old bathro@@ om@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the black style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is surrounded , there will be new windows built . &quot;
everything that sol@@ ves later &quot; beautiful bourgeois close &quot; will be expressed as Thomas Sch@@ erer &apos;s expressed .
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness and a meeting room belongs to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you do not want to position up at the high level of hotels in foli@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms are set up , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Direc@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause have already led so sh@@ ed@@ ay .
the ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not be able to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor facilities are brought to front of front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace created by the restaurant , which is public , accessible . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Off@@ ler sets Grand Jury
&quot; in Russia @-@ president of US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller was supposed to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; in the past weeks , the panel was recorded in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote the &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; in appeal to the cause of trusted persons . &quot;
the paper added the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensified .
&quot; the sender of CN@@ N reported , there is already the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ entu@@ ated the Krem@@ lin since longer to be targeted at the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is investig@@ ating whether there were ab@@ sten@@ tions between Tr@@ umps presidential @-@ team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are standing in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; according to that , Mu@@ eller reported more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Tr@@ ump personally have moved into the center and seek the re@@ assurance whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to consider present evidence in potential cases , and decide whether the indictment should be charged . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called charges .
&quot; mostly they are switched on , if it is a larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched off by the pro@@ secutor to charge people under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , CN@@ N were already issued re@@ inv@@ itations to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report .
&quot; furthermore , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps Consult@@ ant and in law was J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam@@ p election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the interview . &quot;
&quot; right saying said on Thursday night on Thursday , that the Re@@ duction show that mu@@ eller would not let himself be intimi@@ dated in his work and that he should be if necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on to decide about the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening was a speech in West Virginia to illustrate the Russia @-@ affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he knows nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work also usually in the secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advocate all measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey did three times that it is not established against the president .
&quot; you have no reason to suppose that something changed , it was on the explanation further . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; because of this cr@@ ush @-@ gro@@ w@@ fs , pre @-@ accus@@ ations have turned out against Tr@@ ump , he has to im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him for the investigation of the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is on the basis of the investigation under great pressure .
after the presentation of US @-@ media the White House has gathered material against the special medium and its employees .
the sol@@ itude spec@@ ulations over whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller can be released .
&quot; unlike an independent special result of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the president Richard Ni@@ xon , has found Mu@@ eller a position in which it could be fired theoretically on the presidents of the President of Justice Department . &quot;
&quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a step , however . &quot;
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday , which could no longer be released as easy after the special result . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has solved from the close @-@ time size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the one tri@@ l@@ lion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers long Kol@@ oss get to the north and will probably need two , three years until he is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice plots , researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the upheav@@ al of the ice , is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , that could be combined with the heating of heating . &quot;
the now broken colleague has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C fe@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow by the sea and is growing regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this swe@@ ep was the balance of wax and ab@@ rup@@ ting a few years ago .
&quot; a complete Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is was there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C fe@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because they have never been able to with@@ stand as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice top is under tension and could cr@@ ush in case of a key point a piece of ab@@ rupt . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea @-@ sea since they swim on the water and gives ice so much water as it comes after the melting yourself .
&quot; however , the loss of foam costs leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly flow into the sea to flow and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the same measure , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the Antar@@ ctic for AW@@ I @-@ data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres - the fourth largest archipelago in the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge of the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct connection is aware of climate change , the king@@ sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; confirmed also . &quot;
&quot; among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C fe@@ el@@ fe@@ is will go back then again or go down , and possibly together , his colleague said to Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers are unable to res@@ ign the departure of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , in the past few decades , however , many ic@@ el@@ ves of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula are broken . &quot;
this long brick of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula in the past 50 years passed around three degrees , and thereby used to the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants hood if the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy free positions , the CD@@ U calls out of the employer association to step more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag 41 new places in the administration has led to the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 attacks and officials work for the Kreis@@ administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have gone behind their first working day . &quot;
the apprenti@@ ces at the circle are obviously very popular .
about 6@@ 20 applications were available for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to face personnel to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann there are still 50 not occupied points . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought after . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , and assume the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot;
the management should work out a concept for recruitment and human development under the request of the parties . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of professional forces , but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented of applicants , says it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ cat@@ ers and include a educational , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with staff problems that you did not know earlier .
other cities are holding good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a right &quot; &quot; contest of public employers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related reasons come from the service . &quot;
&quot; maximum time for action so , so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party . &quot;
he had a long ago long ago in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he was publicly challenged the head@@ count openly in question and the remaining parties were stun@@ ned .
people want to be checked all the possibilities that allow all the possibilities to take an exit from the municipal worker association .
&quot; if we fail to reach a satisfactory solution here , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - might strive for people , such as peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it fores@@ ees the collective service to the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , ca@@ vities or more money there is only when you are moving into a higher level , oriented towards employment years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle are growing steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ Constitu@@ ent Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ tor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to NGO @-@ migrants &quot;
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that employ b@@ ail@@ out boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue to comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organization &apos; youth retri@@ eves &apos; , because the team had worked effectively with human hands in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation for a year since one year , it refused to express itself as a detailed pre @-@ president of the Italian Public Pro@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , saving the human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we are able to assess all accus@@ ations , which are currently being collected only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his occupation takes din@@ gh@@ y on board , which are delivered to them directly by human hands , and that the smug@@ gler can decrease , so that ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such coincidence , only 1,3 miles took place in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Pro@@ secutor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
the occupation is suspected to be suspi@@ ci@@ ated on the authority of the Italian coast @-@ guard the life@@ jacket in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives monitors .
&quot; under the Code of Conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all have a Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved who are involved in search and rescue operations , have previously prepared to keep themselves up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabled &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel Prize Organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants returned strongly in Italy during the last weeks to strengthen the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried the cooperation with the local civil masters of fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizenship in this month about economic development initiatives , and with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries leave in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
sei@@ zur@@ es and tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and attractions . &quot;
there were three be@@ un@@ ed guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the hot summer @-@ temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there are view@@ points , partly on towers , one of which could look far over the Pf@@ el@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ placed levels . &quot;
in between there were a long @-@ term approach for the long triumph@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , point of view to the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ wn &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate an@@ cho@@ es . &quot;
on the last two days many altitude of altitude were told .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ air condition cur@@ sing Sole .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres the group had the Pf@@ el@@ zer forest of its best side - sporty and culturally - met .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga et for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in the future before computer consoles instead of moving through the wind and weather to fight over the stadium ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high gin including . &quot;
this also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ a who are increasingly involved in this area .
&quot; the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later opened the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department , and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is certain that on this train even several associations rise up .
&quot; on the next weekend , the soccer world association in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V inser@@ ts are qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30 years of age , that the young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all the possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be able to present much more often on these markets as only once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ ament to Asia . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; while e @-@ sport will play computer games like &quot; League of Le@@ gends , &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer @-@ simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport as well , Li@@ gen is established , where the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
for many it is the idea for sure .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been dealing with the question as well .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many organic and physical responses show that one can also find in classical sport - for example increased heart rate , stress levels , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to guide on online play difficult and in the scene l@@ acked the structures of classical sport .
&quot; positive , scientists also highlights the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; the players are on the international road , which is like a big global family , there is no intercultural shirt . &quot;
a study conducted by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , it had been implemented 50 million euros in 2016 , mainly about advertising , sponsorship , and great tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales must be at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundesliga in football , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy impose on su@@ icide , condemned &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through lyrics and calls for su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to trial . &quot;
Carter was sentenced in June for a casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy which took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday during the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ end@@ ous .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to appeal .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but he argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cre@@ me@@ able Bl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down down@@ ward eyes , when they were condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosecution of the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no Re@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ te lawyer said , it is an &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; which they de@@ pl@@ ore completely . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their mind @-@ disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t forget the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I would like that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters , says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be taking part in the wedding of her brother or be an aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this only person to have with which I got together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will keep in my life for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit to a different su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters &apos;s statements made revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring of a building , first you know , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that had sent them into the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and realized that they may benefit from the case by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended the Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x was sentenced to 2007 for murder of their British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run by the Audi Cup as captain was not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern Trust the Con@@ fed Cup winner in a great season - Extra motivation is not there .
&quot; what was otherwise on his place in the cabin , which looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but there was far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made him the assigned bin@@ ders to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first bet as an Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
good that could have been able to run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach could also indicate that way .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen by youth players , deb@@ tors and especially from holidays to professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ l is divided into the dearest one to those , to whom you want to be done in mood . &quot;
&quot; who , so , who was chosen to enter the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra @-@ motivation for only good use . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ row over the field .
&quot; to the right back , that is now his position , the white bin@@ ders on the arm did their rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ me got into this starting stage , like the one who can also take the rest of the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al thus , to play its missing fitness ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus , to the devil come out to the achievements of Asia @-@ Travel ( fol@@ te also only ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with them , in their first appearance at the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t was not negative . &quot;
this is the least fol@@ ly very good .
&quot; Sü@@ ver ran aside from Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both agile sovereig@@ n@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; the renowned Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried also in the game structure a few times successful . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy gave us that the result was not as much as we hoped that .
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; playing shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; like un@@ inhabited , this Bavaria world is still for the re@@ accessible , you saw afterwards to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ mir spoke after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le a very interesting sentence , &quot; &quot; What goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
you simply have to win any game at Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one more . &quot;

&quot; it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected after more than one year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ aming the old minister at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ er Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Know pi@@ cks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us &apos;s biggest K@@ ehr@@ er sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the lookout closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer is now up to the primary list of the country .
&quot; this year , the ministry is still hoping for a planning process , until 2021 is supposed to stand right . &quot;
a role in the country &apos;s plans will also play the West@@ um@@ er Tri@@ er who stands in the pre @-@ pressing requirement of the Federal Convention .
&quot; the goal is to take the track in December 2020 , says Prime Minister @-@ speaking in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees in it a be@@ acon to support regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Trade Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to increase in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start their own company , lo@@ wers the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er sees an extra incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;

the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road construction , quickly facts be able to create quickly , lack the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Bell auer , Chief Executive of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who want to adapt to the Wis@@ sing , are so far only 29 places . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .

Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer the software to update more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president told the company that &quot; &quot; it would be more intelligent options as driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon emissions .
&quot; however , the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des that em@@ power diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , to install equipment for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles , also take advantage of what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also charged the powerful car firms to pamp@@ er and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so called de@@ ton@@ alt devices , which could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italians , and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be judged in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities accused , having installed the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that concentrated on the United States , has been extended . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could cause Volkswagen hard to strain : the luxury automobile manufacturers contributes to the gain of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was at times one of the best published carto@@ on display , the l@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian works and works on a film .
&quot; his message : lau@@ ghing , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Guill@@ das Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
in the first few years as an artist he struck up among other things as a pointer of bliss - what was frustrated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris match &quot; and then in the &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o many fans found .
again and again the artists of the cities are inspired .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures tum@@ our in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing , he works for almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches find its dro@@ pping figures still much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years he has also been working on a cartoon film , and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ ght@@ fold class as a counter player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film , the 2019 on the chin @-@ wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
&quot; therefore he sets out more on the TV series , which is produced , as its original terms , wor@@ dless . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is because of the dro@@ re remin@@ ders and due to the diseases of insects , which are trying to find solutions and farmers who are trying to find solutions , big head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Institute of Research Institute of CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , which brought in spring a lot less rain and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has an effect on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ k@@ ads , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
&quot; Lav@@ end@@ el@@ oil is not only available for holiday@@ makers , it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are being considered , a better water distribution and slo@@ wing of the waste from the floor , also include a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dry . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly paper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet with their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a , through which organised crime , corrupted officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more safe : they should take their children with their office , which were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ates , or let them leave at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ ale , allies . &quot;
&quot; if you ask the re@@ porters , suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and abs . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs , politicians , business@@ men , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals , which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there are no more journalists from violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are ever more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 have taken his office at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , its editors and your inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
the greatest mistake is to live and journ@@ alist in Mexico and wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
&quot; his lack is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which marks his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the journalists discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ wal@@ d was established to deal with the cases of journalists , these according to the committee to protect journalists was initiated only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still persist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ted and even though the terrain is now still tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefits to discuss the security of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mis@@ trust . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the office of the paper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital city of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive it only a few blocks away , until his rot@@ er Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced from his car and 12 times were shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ d river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but to the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ lements of the country , since rival@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ver@@ tically , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ en for drugs royal ones who are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; tranquility &apos; if only one cart@@ el control over the coastal enst@@ a@@ at with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , there was the publication of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival@@ ing cart@@ on in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez not to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had released the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues would always be there to be there .
he served as an experienced re@@ porter for the Nor@@ thwest in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce with five colleagues on the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the cra@@ w@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it to publish hard accurate studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which no one else had to treat . &quot;
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for protecting journalists on the persecution of the Mexican drugs history , wherever it led . &quot;
he gave voluntarily to him that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you need to take the task that falls as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who cur@@ sed like a do@@ ckers , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher who knew how to survived . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite to the office , go to the table and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now she ask : was his love of routine his destruction ?
&quot; his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions regarding how they can do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; you do not like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their c@@ anny and Lan@@ de@@ cars , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier is happening . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are not considered as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ glers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce were not allowed any mobile phones . days previously , Spy@@ ware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ range area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the poli@@ c@@ emen that the Governor itself considered un@@ trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has led to three main stories .
there was the assassination of brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , which focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the pro@@ secutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was offered as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all the political planes . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors have been accused of imp@@ aired cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porters about previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including a one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went a military over@@ fall . &quot;
&quot; only a few months previously , the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists on behalf of the press . &quot;
re@@ porters Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez caught a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the office of the Pro@@ secutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more powerful , having written in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking distance and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez the authorities to pronoun@@ ce journalists and let them embrace it because they have said the truth .
&quot; it has since then asked that it is divided once again by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has wounded their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , committed to involved governmental officials and an equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journalist &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who have been organized with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you live , because they want you to watch the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mor@@ de have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer ta@@ stat@@ ur and ear@@ phones aside from their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue how it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly directed to drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and seek dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be poet gives him sc@@ ared to the drug trading .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors sat down from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , than once all of their phones began to deal . &quot;
&quot; a series of sli@@ ppers with band@@ wagon and security guards , near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote . &quot;
the war escal@@ ated on how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the cur@@ stone edge you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ aps near - a further sli@@ des@@ y in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the poli@@ c@@ emen that were orph@@ an@@ ed to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose Mittel@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how you can only remember this , Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day was murdered , the tra@@ inee asked me to send it to the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used to so@@ ak off its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue even though a terri@@ fying .
&quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible nas@@ ic@@ orn of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his love skin was of Roman Braun - and they said , she had something from a &quot; &quot; un@@ quiet past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , &quot; recorded him as &quot; the said din@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens in the world . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ os@@ aur@@ s that lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant nur@@ ses the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the place , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) serious Earth cl@@ ums@@ y .
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ zeln a little with the eyes you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ ere .
&quot; researchers have found that this crop @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with an arm@@ or tank , probably threatened by meat , probably threatened by meat . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology that is used as contrasts , which are also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to so@@ ak its enemies , say experts which indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ ers . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ os@@ aur@@ s family made the head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild beast and studied Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta market mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ er Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to expose it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of scales and arm@@ aments on his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals live above . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of enough pressure by meat fres@@ hing din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted that the evolution fav@@ ored the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most of contemporary animals , which apply the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , z@@ ebras or gir@@ t - are much smaller and hur@@ ting as loot , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ os@@ aur@@ s was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s have to have been the chal@@ k predat@@ ors of the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including its con@@ ser@@ fourth Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal .
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s when he died , turned into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ os@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with conve@@ yed skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of the animal keeps &quot; , &quot; Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as exactly as it is in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , as huge ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ ere , which rose on two legs , the earth went through . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the p@@ aired din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was ens@@ hr@@ ined after death in the sea , and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the said din@@ osau@@ r din@@ os@@ aur@@ s in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch tips , which sha@@ kes from his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant nur@@ ses by the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater feed of the din@@ osau@@ r keep his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well received that the skin remains still b@@ umpy tank along the din@@ ers cover
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ use it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied reset of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy tank panels , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right @-@ foot foot lies on his side , his five fingers are pointed to the top . &quot;
I can count the scales of his sole sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ sions
violent accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous publishers , kilometres from - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people have been injured in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people . &quot;
&quot; after the first information of the police , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) had almost 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ tw@@ isted . &quot;
&quot; on the exact number of the injured , there are no information on the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it is about light to moderate injury , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher . &quot;
a great deal of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in cycling Munich a approximately ten kilometers long retreat .
&quot; like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also on the reverse @-@ way to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire@@ fighters quoted the labels of the vehicle en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia which now have to be reck@@ oned with delicate pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 then there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it was a collision between an auto sports and a passenger car . &quot;
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
German railways : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost everyone at once : nothing fl@@ us@@ ingly sits on the train and sleeps .
or one is deepening into his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes an impro@@ per or irrit@@ ating the passenger in the middle of the work@@ flow .
card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon gone .
the Deutsche Bahn are currently creating ticket @-@ card check @-@ out .
&quot; one simply confirms by phone , that you have taken up his place and thus ent@@ ail the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes to , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany early next year , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the rail card de@@ valuation with no work .
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most of the passengers already do .
&quot; you also have to purchase it via the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : one clim@@ bs into the train , his ticket is called &quot; My ticket . &quot; &quot;
in the test customers then a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train guides get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X has been located on the train and taken the seat seat Y .
comes the train companion when driving card control at place Y he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ worth@@ less online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to continue , remain silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to relax without ticket control by our train staff , checked in the DB navig@@ ator easy yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Fern@@ traffic . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs .
&quot; who often drives railway , knows that besides delays and missed , the ticket controls are among the biggest dietary results . &quot;
&quot; for often one has himself , but in any case one of the fellow trav@@ eller does not need all the documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either is missing the credit card or the personal identification , or otherwise a document that you have to pre@@ dict . &quot;
&quot; the result are endless discussions between migr@@ ating leaders and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the part or large room and delays in control of their own tickets and the creativity at the end takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also only on the ICE ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not yet available .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to their core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; she called there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on her fen@@ ed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on their Tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year ago , who was killed by a white police in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live in live . &quot;
he po@@ sted a picture of Bro@@ wns le@@ blo@@ ous body that was spread on the road and would stay there four hours there .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; &quot; she thought to himself . &quot;
but death was for her and her community nothing new .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , who cried out , and by a man who said to be Bro@@ wns Father , who carried a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live @-@ feed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an is faced with a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ishing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , escaped a different poli@@ cem@@ an his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; reminded of their statement . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and that we are typical .
at this moment I felt shame .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11 am , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ants , of love and loss , the strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a pig@@ rell with her daughter , who brought a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown to go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you recall how I have taught , when black people have to fight for the fight to believe in them ? &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the lucky enough to give her an experience in which they are personally not experienced a ek@@ lat@@ ted racism , it is not unlike the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them away from them . &quot;
&quot; the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Road , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was engaged in a camp@@ ground , as the activists on the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Wilson war@@ med . &quot;
&quot; there were Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected to a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and hal@@ lowed to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on Es@@ sens justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came about Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from white - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the former Co @-@ director , Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell &apos;s project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
that was the main thing for me as these people are represented because I will be represented .
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah leader , but to a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an , she turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ ells &apos; life as they love themselves and mar@@ ries their wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ ghed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the Menshevi@@ k of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos; history has repeated history the role of black b@@ umps women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y of Martin in 2012 had shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sul@@ ph@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it is however that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at the pig@@ lets , due to their identity as the heart of the film was chosen . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sp@@ elled this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front front as it was in front of a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is a demonstration for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ age of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that they call their home : &quot; a mess .
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ oned herself to a singing , and she feels committed to this memory since it was three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , though it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian street , since the first presentation 2009 , the population has been put into advocates and opponents . &quot;
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
&quot; also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; &quot; popular and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; the subject is discussed . &quot;
&quot; while one thing about the bit @-@ gallery say , &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( &quot; An@@ ja Becker ) &quot; or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( &quot; An@@ ja Becker ) &quot; or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( &quot; &quot; An@@ ja Becker ) &quot; , &quot; or quite simply : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates ins@@ isted that a gallery will take more customers into the city , which also attracts the rest of the business , fear the opponents that then ble@@ w the pedestrian bleeding . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned precisely on the property , on which the peasant market hall is , in the 13 direct market @-@ market @-@ market . &quot;
with the start of construction will be a conclusion .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - with a possibility to go outside sitting .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farms always like to be very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market entry in a Mark@@ thalle in the gallery enters the amount of rent .
but that is likely to be low at the new project but not just low . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why Commercial Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; if clothing , shoes , dr@@ um@@ e- or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many shop stores here stand empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market here , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered here is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the manufacturer and is very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , Lad@@ en@@ stores are reserved in a shopping basket only by larger companies , because the dor@@ ms are often not viable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it , then it will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - also for duration when the bit @-@ gallery actually occurs sometime .
or does it create the spec@@ ter bit gallery previously to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , also no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , yes , thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ful many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no room more . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant mark@@ thalle is made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
one suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ vari@@ ably identical - that are dependent on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair sections that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st gave a 35 @-@ year @-@ year arrest warrant , after having found diplomatic messages on the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly . &quot;
the new exhibition which was opened on 2 August is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer science and art , as he had been transformed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the DNA analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and made from the thirty portraits , as someone could look at the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways of how it can be interpreted , and the in@@ dur@@ ated determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to the identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly spoken about identification as a woman , it was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage Act , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison their image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ deur , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing is clearly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat , and a plat@@ el@@ blonde Per@@ ücke carries - with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of its 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette and che@@ wing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were made to un@@ equal bril@@ liance that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they created even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images &quot; , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future that would transform the President Chel@@ ta &apos;s judgement and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years ago was a welcome kind of happy encounter . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat low@@ ly and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid divisions , which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written by his superior testimony ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name called &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name , called &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; in their family name , called on with one heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic de@@ frag@@ mentation whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a thou@@ ght@@ fully of Cs and gs and As is written in pencil .
&quot; showing De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , hoping to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ sti@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it , is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned com@@ ic no@@ vel@@ le .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a release @-@ star in the hand of the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ kas@@ ary of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; when they address your speech , they have won &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that it wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted out of Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book , but if they should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ rum which collap@@ ses like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ posed , as everything in the exhibition , through to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , who formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford because of kill@@ ings
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which are sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
on Monday we were issued on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ self ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) War@@ ren because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau because of their alleged involvement in the Cook County of Cook County .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
one of the police authority of the Chicago release of Chicago release that the glue on 27 July was discovered .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several violations on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained at the place of the action for dead , and det@@ ective examine the embro@@ ider@@ y as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of micro @-@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ans , vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self was now in favour and excluded from the participation of the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ator authorities in any way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want he to himself .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , he demanding the susp@@ ects strongly to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a concept of her residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that was said in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ ws and war@@ ms were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motiv@@ ations , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage in fulfilling the criteria of the passenger plan , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing about concern for Russia . &quot;
everything has been announced all will be implemented .
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list referred to by the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged nation@@ als in Russian exercise must publicly accept . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; We carry out the test because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has prov@@ oked a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that exists . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian Center R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov was added to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; said S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada in Russia .
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the captain of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups which will help your company not to become next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers are unable to process the process . &quot;
&quot; there were simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on wa@@ xing to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of staff commitment , they allow companies to provide surveys , special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers allow to deal with C @-@ Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure commitment . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said , that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows which units have most complaints and which managers have low interest results - so you can drill out why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have to be the next one who has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since then a former employee published a blog post by which those who spoke to have been punished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is after an overview a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the financial website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour , seeing an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies can send &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report their own behavior .
&quot; and when the main business guide is included , complaints directly to the supervisory board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has gathered Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is ill @-@ treated or un@@ ethical , it may be expensive consequences by consumers boy@@ cott , worker @-@ flight and boxes , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ cent for more than one year is used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their business central . &quot;
&quot; formerly if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to follow complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , can problems that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ selfish practitioner , are identified faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can arrive closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree vision in the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; says Vit@@ rano who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment - legal disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , ethics , values and employee involvement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations through the En@@ ron scandal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology for monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and re@@ charge the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors both supported start @-@ ups .
&quot; the Conver@@ cent was awarded $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures , T@@ ola Capital , which raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more to be expected from their jobs than before .
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when men are happy to be in a company that you feel their voices , and that the work you do is profitable , then they will feel more strongly to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which are both convertible and lin@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve renov@@ ations if their portfolio companies are well underway . companies are running well if employees are campa@@ igning and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise , dedication and commitment to the employee , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
data about the staff &apos;s commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have a expectation that changes on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can be trained and presented . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen itself too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow people will ask yourself , &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t her really heard me ? &quot;
take care of this ?
and whom do you not care about why ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who has now led to monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustrated staff she was able to re@@ organize with the speed of decision @-@ making and quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run it leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will also lose customers . &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ges
it goes on 23 PM as a lot U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ ball@@ ers talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team at campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot@@ ics parts and show the back filled with sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this is an un@@ iting time a lunch break .
&quot; players who are in@@ scri@@ bed on the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the next morning at 6 : 30 to water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mühle , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to ease the burden of players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finals on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three training of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 p.m. to meet the already completed time of the player . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ges were moved to the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood .
&quot; they are to stick in the course of August 18 exercises . at the beginning of the formal play@@ ings , for their start @-@ up against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he added the control changes of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the multiple routes to the player to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they have simply pushed it , they are plac@@ eable , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is already a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been thrown with foot@@ wear , which will already be a protective network behind a tor@@ p@@ posts , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ges players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched that people rent a room there and then set up a exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the Vide@@ ob@@ and from an exercise , it is quite a good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folding applications by third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods , to recognize possible fal@@ cons and to send them to fac@@ ten@@ ders , which may display results of the test exam from the original item . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the major part points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters are going to be punished with wrong stories in May ahead of the presidential elections in May ahead of the presidential elections in May . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told Facebook in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization of which stories of fact de@@ ported third parties are challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; testing &quot; in connection with articles and works on other changes to his News @-@ Fe@@ ed to decrease wrong messages .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was visible in a squee@@ ze music video and was a slip hole in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years turbulent history of its cozy seat at Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and now is an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ar@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful , to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , he says we@@ eping . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; un@@ disturbed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , William Len@@ kie@@ wicz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ year @-@ years who was working for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters always come to smoke , because at that time they had a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he was even involved . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is , so with old pap@@ ists , he is being supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest &quot; ) this is all too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ iled hy@@ bri@@ dal heads in the walls and the bottles had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and talked with landsc@@ aped , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists , who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust first received full access as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ es on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English , cards which , who possessed , &quot; &quot; you might think that country @-@ conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go up ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a wider base in the English history , including &apos;@@ The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , entered this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ fe de of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmer started in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in which he filled his own funeral by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery , which was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seem to be right , always going to be debts and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men lö@@ sten their debt crises by killing rich old women - I imagine it as a pile of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ am experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has joined a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ paraly@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; ah , now I must return with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf envel@@ op@@ ed
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand . &quot;
till Thursday Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team to Nelson Ar@@ tz hold the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August it should be as the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday released page . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we believe that as a bath , we know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; when the action go for more than &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot;
&quot; it is valid to form@@ ulate an ever @-@ to @-@ stand promise , one that the city gives an unmistak@@ able unique site . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a medium @-@ digit amount will be the town of Bad Honnef to cost its new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ings and evaluations in the officers sk@@ ps .
this week is also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is a routine for the Turkish armed forces after the coup .
&quot; the session was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; in discussions under the presidency of the government now , the five vice chan@@ ts as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers participated . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ number . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; general manager of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were set . &quot;
&quot; since the coup , President Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Admir@@ als have been fired . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who should have been involved in the attempt to have been involved in Ankara , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup had Erdo@@ gan the overthrow of a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff there are concerns for an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , wrote in the lifting of the head@@ ache for sol@@ dat@@ s , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ pur@@ ities in the army and the security forces goes on any further . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan , by decree , another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state fire@@ fighters , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan seemed to be the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times of appeal on their role as guardian of the worldly state order .
&quot; after his election on 2002 , Erdo@@ gan declined the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan driving a targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; warned not so @-@ called officers who sought asylum after the coup from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; when this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is a question in the alliance according to the inf@@ estation of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US @-@ immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees , to reduce the legal immigrants of 50,000 a year to reduce stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining permanent working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do this by changing the way to citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; these new Candi@@ date Proc@@ ed@@ ure will speak the candidate who have the English means to assist themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to make track of track record
&quot; over the past months , over the future of the race at the race - now it was going to go quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ o@@ des stretch , on which the tourist railway drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing trip in the long term , after the traffic @-@ Ministry , the traffic conditions of this year will start in the course of this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ g further to order and to san@@ gu@@ ing the country this mainly for tourism connection , &quot; &quot; stated road @-@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l am Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the track he was about 2.5 million Euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country take over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Southern th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as an operator shall be united about the technical details already .
&quot; in this way the roadmap , the vehicles used and quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the racing rigid @-@ shuttle on December 2017 regul@@ ator will be ordered .
the race @-@ shuttle shuttle is one especially among tourists popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and speed@@ sti@@ g .
&quot; over the past months , the course was tested in the course of a pilot project , whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also heavily ra@@ ined in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it cannot be crazy , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ zed professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel . &quot;
&quot; people get fun , but the companies will get lots of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ licate skin that feels warm @-@ feeling - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and thereby select everything from the eye &apos;s color over the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would give a Step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed to robots with a si@@ licate skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they find , such as bulk soli@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of relap@@ se and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible .
&quot; so she likes what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can &quot; &quot; be in the mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects with this climb from sex robots - not least because they will replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties , the play@@ ings on rape when one step up on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , be@@ un@@ quiet one on most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True , the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy was in a vibration with a vibration , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then have no ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex @-@ robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as op@@ tion@@ ale en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most of the men will of course not hold a sex robot , and while the FR@@ R will remember their increasing popularity , they still persist in the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what per@@ me@@ ates out of the edge of the edge , may be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , be very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or offensive until they give the free market permission .
&quot; there is yet a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time wher@@ ein the women &apos;s rights are threatened in the White House , who knows for women to have sexually attacked women . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ terr@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical pictures , the sli@@ pped body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity with actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
they want their inheritance to feel human beings to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot does not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have a mediation or a background story , nothing that could interfere with independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation . &quot;
differently : they are counterf@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ umps big Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the term of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a diver@@ gence of the tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political divisions , who have pol@@ arized the US @-@ voters , also have families in the small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ elected relatives . &quot;
we are all alleged to do all of our filtering bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the Power Tr@@ umps , Family together . &quot;
I chose this because my c@@ ousine is living in Chicago that lives in Chicago for a long time and has been busy with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family who attended this week in New York .
they reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which they fought for decades , suddenly and quite independent on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order for the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls into a further context that it brings considerable risks to itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the lev@@ elling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gross@@ est way that his toll of one day will no longer be ho@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a re@@ inst@@ ant@@ aneous long @-@ time scenario , in the tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of denial . &quot;
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the dog &apos;s preferred version - the dog on the auto@@ cr@@ ach that saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked at ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild crime .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans must only be intellectu@@ ally healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our children to Car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ar of the New York Park@@ Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you do not require caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cris@@ p and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - very dark and the climatic learning music conve@@ ys this in a notable way . &quot;
&quot; so many cl@@ is@@ ers of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream . &quot;
five years later and I still didn &apos;t get over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not in fact a Swiss cottage - the topics @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
&quot; but Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the car@@ us@@ sell , I had given him the full score , but fortunately none of them asked about it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tips of money - this , to buy something over the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow exchange of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation which is not required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ prehen@@ sive gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I tired the experience made her charge my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with breast pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us have left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of schn@@ apps on his hand , which he suffered the prison authorities after a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned to a first death sentence , because of the murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; he was killing ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by passing them several times through a door of the toilet , in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , which hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year @-@ year prison sentence , from which they say , they say too . &quot;
&quot; the National Coalition Authority , said that she will be up to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg is found
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of F@@ unds and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and into the continued schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the kidn@@ apper intimi@@ dation is going to be back to the school , four to the real school . &quot;
Schul@@ tor Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the farmer &apos;s House Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of school@@ ing , the 29 students chose the 29 pupils in the four classes led by Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eagle that grows in the hen erhof , but then it is released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ under Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The eagle in the hen erhof . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken guy got a little eagle .
&quot; but hope to make a chicken from him , the eagle struck up his wings on a high mountain , and de@@ pra@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study by Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ nen danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders to bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young should be different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but are in addition to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every quarter that he feels in his new school .
&quot; there followed the words of acceptance to the colleagues , the former school@@ manager Michael Müller , who again jumps at teaching bro@@ ws , and the par@@ representatives of their representatives . &quot;
&quot; the chi@@ ken@@ ess is now over , declared class instruc@@ tive Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students only very much after two years of lessons , as it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four cl@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
so when children broke great joy .
for the new school year eight former times are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested in Greece because of illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned because of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , with . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of the 1st August , a group of illegal people were arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while the investigation is currently running . &quot;
the Foreign Ministry reported b@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not intended for this purpose . &quot;
the controls are continued during the whole season .
the ministry said that the court can hang a sentence .
software update for diesel cars : what the people affected now have to know
how exactly does the software update will take place ?
must diesel drivers take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are to improve the down@@ grade of cars of the emissions classes € 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from that .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by ACE car Club Europe gives estimates :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only for the vehicles , the Schum@@ mel@@ tdown software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit of its retro@@ fit has arranged the power station ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers announced a high level of implementation in the next months , but it is not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; if in any case be required , this will be done within the frame . &quot;
how long does the re@@ conditioning have to be drawn altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this is due to the commitment from the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , volunte@@ ered to act on the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
re@@ armament could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do motor@@ ists do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE s@@ lick to wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would be re@@ medi@@ ed , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
does a massive price decrease of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving de@@ bot@@ toms are dro@@ pping . &quot;
in rural areas there is so far no impairment for older diesel .
the ACE tra@@ verse with a sale yet to wait .

we make the city life @-@ worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes in R@@ ent in the coming year . &quot;
the place is already written - appropriate applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been established .
and the work is still great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , him , that no application has no application for the requirement . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the time .
&quot; thus , under consideration of the regular cancellation fr@@ ists - still enough time for a review . &quot;
&quot; da Has@@ l@@ ach is based on the Board of Directors as under@@ e building law , the applicant must pre@@ dict the applicant . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; if this is no longer able to fill this , the citizens would have to travel through to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the city &apos;s presence is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reported from a good working atmosphere , as well as good mood between the authority and citizens . &quot;
in more than 30 years some significant projects have gathered together to look back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; we make the city life @-@ value , &quot; he is sure about the construction and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the rainf@@ all around are spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zi@@ g@@ brücke between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; only the latter is to beat around 1.5 million euros with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we make &quot; s properly &quot; , &quot; estimates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all wait great tasks on my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
st@@ amped be for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gardening can be responded to much flexible .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green@@ facilities will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye for what pur@@ ities are approved , empha@@ sizing the ex@@ iting Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; at the end everything goes here with my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in charge of many years : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been around for 15 years now . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to really identify and remain . &quot;
&quot; because continuity is not only important for a good operation , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to confess the Roland W@@ acker should , according to information from the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , should be able to present a closed studies as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor with technical information architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and building law . &quot;
&quot; underground and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , atro@@ cities , management of urban lounge , municipal property , municipal property and under@@ e building law , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : southwest road locked
&quot; according to police , the pre @-@ known perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the field of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the cables . &quot;
these have been so strongly damaged that the rising freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetrators and are looking for the night time after them .
near the scene were observed by witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ oter Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bicycle driver were observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ I , &quot; said O@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch for APA . &quot;
&quot; either , or the perpetrators brought themselves in great danger and also threaten the migr@@ atory traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the delays and expense of the traffic and the cost of the shift in traffic could also be sent to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; altogether , by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were re @-@ fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic could be guided on the south @-@ train station without a disability . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten people were on Friday morning , two of them looked traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains fell out of , but they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 meters of upper lines .
isol@@ ators and Ma@@ sten have also been damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation of intestinal disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could rel@@ ieve the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition in the USA affects some 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are normally advised to rel@@ ieve flesh and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the guiding researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in food , do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are capable to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory intest@@ ine . &quot;
in experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell is found in mice , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial micro@@ bi@@ ome - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us Dis@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han supports tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel if the same system will be wir@@ elessly with humans . &quot;
&quot; the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immun@@ o@@ cell that promotes tolerance than they found out that a group of study belts had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which was separated , but that did not have . &quot;
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal traction .
&quot; the dry of the mice were decorated DNA sequences and were found six species of bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them in the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were re@@ ared into a ster@@ il@@ en environment so that they were missing a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they did not produce these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria depen@@ ded on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transm@@ its small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immun@@ o@@ cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ anth@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of the mice double , the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent , but if the number of cells declined around half . &quot;
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people protect the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i can protect from us in our stomach @-@ intestinal traction .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ ou@@ ter@@ i products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i are developing the cells in humans such as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage , since these cells are controlled inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ic@@ ity can lead to an expansion of these population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , &quot; &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pres@@ eas@@ on game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins and impres@@ sing in the semi @-@ roll , as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira , after expos@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asian tour of the blues , and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .
besides M@@ atic also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadion , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho its start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was still having three other novel@@ ties , but he ins@@ isted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four primary priorities . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if she got four out of four , but they have given themselves great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar of the radar was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was an out@@ fit for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new low @-@ set@@ back for Martin Schulz - Hanover we have a problem
&quot; like the wind , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel , SPD Chief , S &amp; D @-@ Democratic Prime Minister was always a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely there is no stor@@ fire from the party central , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - as the most important wish for the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed dramatically . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House has been watching the events in the SPD governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with objects .
there were low charges .
and one after another .
&quot; the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Nieder@@ sachsen a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and Greens , too . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ality of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the day @-@ day election lost its red @-@ green coalition with it its a @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green President Michael Kellner has called to rep@@ ay its mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear narro@@ wing of the elec@@ torate @-@ will@@ ingly .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Business guide and election place of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; but this must not be true , &quot; &quot; si@@ gh a SPD @-@ election fighter , when on Friday morning , the new hi@@ de@@ message has reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ President of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after the crossing of the green MPs El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own governance . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ers began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades stood at the time . &quot;
&quot; following the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then also - and everything was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the Party . &quot;
&quot; after all , comrades in the weeks after that time went up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next depression came down .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD chief , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did pretty much wrong in the crisis communication , then what one can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for its political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW Affairs and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ esis de@@ vot@@ ees were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps just , Wei@@ l tried to put more and more strongly in the covenant acc@@ ents over the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin also remained hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him because they spoke of course a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; thereby , Wei@@ l meets the internal constraints of the internal constraints , basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz already did not .
&quot; sometimes , comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; your anger focuses on the Greens , and here especially on the down@@ ward parliament@@ arians T@@ west . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets to eat their own career opportunities concerning the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the party left in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ west is not chosen because of their person as a direct can@@ did@@ acy , but of the state of the Lower Sax@@ on Greens to the parliament , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische member have been elected . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l for the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Netherlands as a prime minister in the Parliament &apos;s Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career presents a future CD@@ U parliament@@ arians to the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called for revealing the background .
I want to know whether there has been more or more out@@ going commitments of CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the Local III
who wants to listen to the years in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in delicate .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back to the events so far . &quot;
since 1991 there were in delicate refurb@@ ishment areas .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has still adopted two thirds of the funding . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the grant rise still at 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the former supervis@@ ors are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to further develop the interior development , and not only tap new building areas . &quot;
on April 4th you have received the information provided by the governing Karlsruhe Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation area III .
&quot; the funding will consider 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which were 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest from the municipality . &quot;
how does a san@@ itation now arise ?
&quot; you will continue , investigate , where the &quot; real old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest rates , to san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional limits could then move again . &quot;
the pier appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ country program &quot; Social Town , &quot; as part of which the sanctions would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal cities , improving the living and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be out@@ sour@@ ced , which means a plot of land . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment would finally be determined as a stat@@ ute .
the maintenance period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; however , even until September this year , however , this year would only be conducted , as part of those who receive a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire on the refurb@@ ishment area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tivity should take place as possible , so that the sanctions will be started in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that any Commune had to perform the said pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it &apos;s going to evaluate and decide for the cities of the cities , and decide when re@@ mod@@ elled and to what extent . &quot;
it will then also be registered for the property for the property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again and get a picture of the situation she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed a significant success factor for the project is the participation of the parties involved .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and basic &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; in which there is among other things about the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; may be made available to size , distribution and residents of an apartment . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to fill when operated in the building areas .
&quot; however , to be observed , Got@@ zel pointed out that a made questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures were not conve@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who comes first , ad@@ dition@@ ed first . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to reserve the support for the later &quot; &quot; reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor puts itself a micro@@ chip to come up with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ ghter inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , to open his front door , enter his office and even can start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has performed himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ ans in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles on houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the promotional costs of the White House cost the tax@@ payers
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ el helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event which highlights American production in the last month , takes tax@@ payers to the details of the military , which were left to TI@@ ME Magazin , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Leader of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
&quot; the helicopter was created next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ fts from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 was written on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , Deputy Prime Minister for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the Hel@@ icop@@ ter arrived at 7 p.m. in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long remained before the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure should be delayed out of the White House , due to the limitation of the hours a second team would require for return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight meeting was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the period . &quot;
&quot; from which the TI@@ ME provided , it was not clear whether a second flight student was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could inj@@ ure the determination .
&quot; a question we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impulse for the reform of health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he pushed the efforts to susp@@ end the government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly beneficial for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , to demand their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was done before the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ains about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are shown , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy spokes@@ man of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ crew often lead training tours in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to aver@@ t the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
&quot; as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was subject to training needs for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ payers have not been presented the burden for any other Re@@ qu@@ ites , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not operate Bud@@ get@@ ary desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D supplement for the v@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to the v@@ H @-@ 3D for the v@@ H @-@ 3D but 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
&quot; records of unity see the flight time of the plane , 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Virginia . &quot;
the White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter go far under this rate .
&quot; the costs of tax@@ payers to be set on the basis of estimates for the income distribution is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study of 2015 , the revenues for DO@@ D do not contain the personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ell , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to note that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ cep@@ ted with the helicopter , when he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man account . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and wrote the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

top speed of the Second Tennis Bundesliga occurs at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will be available tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel on the table third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games , even after five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance has received the sense of reality for the reality of the Second Tennis Bundesliga . &quot;

&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially at the rear positions , I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , there are mainly imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their roofs and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets at the Davis Cup .

&quot; this will always be hard for us .
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give max@@ jan@@ four max@@ im .
&quot; at the moment , it is currently creating a member of the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man , coming in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for its first use in this season . &quot;

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump not when he put his signature in the law for the dis@@ ruption of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hal@@ ast , the law to en@@ act , &quot; &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; constitutional rules &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ aded against the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft will be to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the investors of the domestic O@@ MV since then are co @-@ financed by investors of the domestic O@@ MV , which jointly co @-@ financed with other European companies to build the Russian East , Northern Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too soon for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring the sanctions to life even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are standing for the election .
&quot; the press has seen itself , which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really we@@ ave him . &quot;

&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the newest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ den of the Show . &quot;

role back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen assistance
the town organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ garten the clock is re@@ directed .
&quot; on September 1st , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the eating supply in the urban @-@ day care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy leader in the field of youth , this is good news : &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
cooked will continue out of house : a Cat@@ erer taking over this task and delivers fresh cooked cool@@ ed .
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 children &apos;s sites , in 44 the children get a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; over 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; by now , not only children , the 45 week@@ days are looked after , in the K@@ ita to lunch , &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , when children stay up to 14 hours . &quot;
&quot; 46 particip@@ ations have from the 1st September kitchen service : you get war@@ med the angel@@ ed food , supplement them to salad , blan@@ k@@ ost and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food out , rooms , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees will be firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ings as well as seventy @-@ room@@ ed facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement , educational concepts . &quot;
for example it is about healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help eating the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power team is here useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have known a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also task of the kitchen forces - will be completed by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it has also been the charm that it turned out in the cost between equity and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it is called the press . &quot;
and that even though 46 sub @-@ time @-@ forces will be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours fall around 750 people in education area at all not as strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , the United Nations says . &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ sho@@ m , official leader of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are competing in the provinces . three women are can@@ als for the role of the Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday at a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credible if women are fully informed and included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5th .
the Taliban have published threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , for the first time , the elections will be peaceful from a democratically elected government to the next time . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will continue to intensify the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered from a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

men try to rest 13 @-@ year girls to rest
two young men at the age of 19 and 23 years should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year girl .
&quot; according to the information of the police , the men spoke the 13 @-@ year @-@ old men who held up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ strasse , because they wanted to telephone with the phone of the girl . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .

GM@@ B @-@ concerns about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie about the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow .
&quot; GM@@ B Scotland said , the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 people work in the plant , next to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ i said he invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be as first experienced as they would change their activities .
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called to express concerns , that the funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior @-@ Educ@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies for the future of rab@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; for generations , generations of families have worked here and the labour force strongly concentrate on the local community and the major area of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in front of the backdrop of Bre@@ xit , the rising of living costs and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently has a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a speaking in Pla@@ ins said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it since we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees , that we like all companies , who are active in an extremely competition and uncertain economic lim@@ a , our business is continuously checked and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully . should our business procedures change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La League likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not release in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after spending an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to trigger its free@@ ware clause , but have warned Barcelona three years prior to the world incident ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world @-@ ord to more than double of the previous brand , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds back to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the highest paid professional athle@@ te of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out outside , though there is always a source near the Catal@@ ans Provi@@ dence that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
but the football world was warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G President to this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report dis@@ bur@@ dens Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the Final Report for the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ders , spokes@@ person for the Re@@ press Movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated by the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Cardinal R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse . &quot;
&quot; it would serve to the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller und R@@ atz@@ inger would strongly express its deepest regret about its own om@@ is@@ sions , or their back then wrong evaluation of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence at the domain sp@@ lash with &quot; two measures &quot; measured . &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt nobody that must be punished and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts ; however , the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation &quot; , &quot; says the author in Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of lab@@ eling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of all @-@ day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you will be happy to go on to the church , and this is a swe@@ eping fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; beats a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to be done with fre@@ chen children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they exist unfair , current standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse cases , the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; totally to injustice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann who comp@@ lied with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he values the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which is presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clarification of lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sp@@ elled from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ bilities &quot; victims of assault , 67 domain sp@@ ying sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it is possible to cling that by Dom@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment could also be severe for the students . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other allegations , many victims estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even to connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the Final Report on the abuse of the rainbow Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger calls for his opinion un@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the incidents of violence appointed by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; to a lift , many pupils emerge his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , who was hand @-@ hand to the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a domain name musi@@ cally took no top performance . &quot;
how do you describe this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you are doing the trouble and read the whole 440 page long report from front to the back , one has to ask yourself rather , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all found in it . &quot;
he has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from every suspi@@ cion of the Mitt@@ ler@@ - or Mit@@ knowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the violence of poetry at the pres@@ ch@@ ool occurred outside of its efficiency .
&quot; you can pre @-@ throw it at all , from which too late or first lawyers do not have taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the domain of the domain , on which it worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sky &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the wide majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very good witness , &quot; &quot; popular &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to wo@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; that he was not only shared with chairs , and cast the keys and cast on the ground , but also swal@@ lows guys in the hair or ears , he has already given years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and apologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor of salvation , however , must be said that such tut@@ ors in the survey time , the 1960s , and 1970s were widely used , with parents like teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think of each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; also I have experienced this in a se@@ cular school , a state of school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what this is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the power of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule , are of the certainly dre@@ at@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; when one asks oneself , whether it is not more with its familiarity and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI from Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many of the media have just returned to him . &quot;
&quot; on the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still di@@ lig@@ ently off . &quot;
but the truth is : the report dis@@ bur@@ dens Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in connection with the report , we reported a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be placed in the Final Report as well , as in terms of sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to become acquainted with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never sinned myself to speak with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; said a person for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the true problem with educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent from shame .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir leader who would like to become a colleague of the perpetrators , for a professional career . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen student R@@ atz@@ inger role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questionable disciple formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have been timely and the respective perpetrators would have been able to stop .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that there is rested , or clearer or even more likely , than compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , trust instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
that you speak with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the students involved in advance and / or whose environment trusted , could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; so , what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak from every co @-@ learning . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused , not being prevented or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to get his good name in connection with these contradic@@ tory crime , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media was a lot of &quot; violence &quot; eating during the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was pre @-@ cast in the report .
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed up and dec@@ ei@@ ves became a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the midst of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is exactly what is the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , there is therefore clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the g@@ ymnasium of dom@@ inion , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other pre@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers pre @-@ incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir leaders of the dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful inspec@@ tors , the cases in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ w@@ ler teachers were trans@@ duc@@ ted and mal@@ nourished and among them were de@@ fici@@ ent , un@@ attended all at the pres@@ ch@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with that , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain of the domain . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as the most witnesses emphas@@ ise the theme &quot; &quot; Vor@@ school &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in the domain name ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but just not a sa@@ vi@@ ous violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even to connect positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; so , at the most still remains the re@@ bel , looked off . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two time periods where he was reported by the states at the Vor@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish and from the events at a school where he just did not work and he was responsible , and then again and again around 1993 . &quot;
Mi@@ xed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain name council , which the report even re@@ produces . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out to it , &quot; that the inspec@@ tors continue to practice in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the risk of negative press coverage , he received urgent advance . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when testing was banned also in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that they occurred in a legal area , as everyone of us probably still knows . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him , where the affected may be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can not say , he has always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the exam@@ iner was officially officially made in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards on the time of time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk of the &quot; &quot; pit@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger , past this is the danger of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ yst@@ ine has already right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school and violence against inno@@ c@@ els , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all terri@@ bly and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , therefore ear @-@ pe@@ ers and to pull in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment then was banned , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s the picture of his rainbow time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope ? &quot; &quot;
was the topic check@@ wei@@ ghed also in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells of his perspective , as the domain thro@@ ats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not at all that he led to a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but even this must once again be said : without this perfec@@ tionist , without demanding un@@ related discipline , it would hardly ever have been possible from that until then quite nationally @-@ known Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , an institution of world tran@@ scen@@ ding , true cultural leaders in Europe ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons , one does not even make a great singer and every success in which area , however , always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of man have you experienced for the book George R@@ atz@@ inger for the talks to her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and over and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep faithful and heart@@ felt good people , from whom you could not imagine that he could only do a fly @-@ to @-@ fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with , as many former dom@@ es@@ at@@ zen still today , 23 years after his empowerment , he regularly read him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgive him today , that he was once more strict , so are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the domains are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he was always a good , pat@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a stric@@ ter father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respectable person , to which she still look at her today and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and , please , again clear : everything you pro@@ ach to him , are the gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were at the time of the day . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is a prominent , and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intention that stands behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was published just , ent@@ ail him . &quot;
