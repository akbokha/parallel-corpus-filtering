<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards which change your sight to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a greeting, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is excavated."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-gardeners manage the one-edge reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map estuaries promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when landing cards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had to get exciting, because the car-Navi took place instead of a locker road a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical land cards of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of Geoportas Bavaria of the government, are anything but up-to-date - but this is precisely very conclusive."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and villages have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchepts which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great supervisible card, for cities and communities are more detailed maps, so-called urine blades."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerase administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipping the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Customer: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army established Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitioneges with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops passed away with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV drive the project forward, founded the" topographic Bureau "and thus the Bayerische Government administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The case for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison from the morning / today is an example of the state capital, as an example."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has spread in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was shared 21 years after creation of the map, thus 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader in the Bavarian farmer against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the western park is seen, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in written form with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten Flurpieces from the so called" "urine intake" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots occupy there today no more farmers - but small-gardeners of the plant in Sun.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green surface stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 swings of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the jungle leaf one reads in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name" "at Gasteig" "or from the hill" "On the fan" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "."</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse" one was once stacked by people with madness. "</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt on the Auer Lüch.</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard of Gudden, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden, launched the establishment - that psychiatrists, associated with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and for example, for instance, the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the inmates," Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who occupied himself an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, was first place, later on 500 places was expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity will no longer be made - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there is since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-hospital in Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatry in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">At the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt is now meeting young people in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order received the building complex in 1920 and walked it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, we set up the children house" "Casa Don Bosco" "based on the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as the main square, which was named" "Kaufinger alley". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought forward by the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a greetings from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on April 5, 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil law Group published travel insurance for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri's discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory to the state of Missouri, who is going to come into force by the state, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors, and Missourianer to leave for travel through the state as a series of fragmentary, impure-based incidents in the whole state occur and here, it is stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recent S & D Act of Missouri, which makes it people harder to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, prompted the group to give up-to-date, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "they have injuries of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they will be assembled or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group held like racist offenders against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had taken any more during the journey through the state, and taken by Missouri in custody, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent edition of the Office of the General state-General of Missouri, where it is shown that black motorists in the state will last 75 percent more frequently than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring it aside money or they know their relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri promised in 2015 100 of hate, according to the latest figures from the hate-reporting report of the FBI, which the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil LiberUnion (ACLU) had published travel concerns for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration have been adopted, people are committed to protecting people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further edges of the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel statements are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry of other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weiaaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidefence project is a success project and continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given itself a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right digging court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the fisheries bacher CDU are linked together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann has initially placed insights into its operation, in which he employs 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk-kisses and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-milk" "is for him the aging of an alternative marker for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV-chairman of fishing bach, he signed the crossover project as an" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot act on such a steep surface.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, much must be processed with the Motorsense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the elongated operation and posted it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he has no bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the depletion project and is happy to support the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to support the farmers."</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the forestation of the areas could still be taken out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people working in agriculture and therefore think about how to continue their operations," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface area amounts to 40 hectares that can not be found until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded half over the leaders, a district carried out the municipality of Basbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidefence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you make a really good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"even for Peter White, there was also best food products."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscaffgerigeriie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of ordination.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence is the presence of one of the LPR-signed conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the funnel surface may not be missive (Hanging about 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"in 2018, for the fisheries management of Weidezek, 2018 is currently running out of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build slightly 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface corresponds 35 hectares, the cold costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transition is it when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore, the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not take the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators could have made him ynx when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta:" "I don't want to enter a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to that later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is right properly, but as he described it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your fatigue, your arms, / your pressed masses, which are longing for free to breathe, / den miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elful waste" on our screen was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed not to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that she served a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by showing in an used classical image, the female embodiment of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the feminine figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is himself a different name: mother of Exilators.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that the American flame is coming into the world:" "Lady Liberty goes forward."</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the Fackel of the freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Fackel should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something hit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of seeing them as they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch shall not enlighten the path, but the hatred, who is the only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black looted members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds yourself of a time when only two stentions belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member states in the world championship will contribute a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of shottic athletes was selected for London 2017 that will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland" "something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it", "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals for medals there, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was amazing," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were shottable or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real sense, the Eilidh quite naturally caught, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winning at their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" "incredible" "that it is" "incredible" "that it is" "incredible" "in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's country has so far been the best total number of athletes at the World Championship in the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstreak muir runs on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m run, is another flush, which was included in the British Team of Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle reminds himself of her first world Championships, when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannerts chapters says that they are" enormously proud "to the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about team-surrender is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour for me, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and have chosen me, making it something really special for me", "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all those who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise on Pounds."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned about?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it simply will be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics over Facebook: do not throw you a public office if you can't tolerate the healing of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers were hit him because of all, from the internal policies up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shimed in criticism of certain.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought its critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783 Washington said," "the freedom can be taken away - and, dumb and mute, we will be guided as the sheep to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it, more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties had promised him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "Na, and?". ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is an Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitler head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to unite with his voters and play his hailless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of individuals coming to the side of the governors - which is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by employees that are paid by public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post Office, Hogans Speaker's actions in Amelia Chasse, the actions of the governor and argued that the comment of the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hwater filled people, which resonates online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments was respectful, thoughtful, and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest sought the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked to break down."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news," wrote them in the commentary section of the news "" The Post "." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take place at the same theme, then they are regarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors had been referred to as" "concentrated spam attack," "would probably call" "pronunciation". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or a negative comment will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is a lot of cleaners than in former time when one had done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders, to burn or burn demonstrators or protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what exactly happens.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise his Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is despised by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to US-district James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she appointed a voter of her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailbox."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized its position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, complained its ministry, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of expression, opinion between various and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept.</seg>

<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne her bags did not packed and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love me in love and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of the large apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room-estate with a curved layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she asked the architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not only a development, but also a place for the life of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the blanket was not big enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to solve the preset.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were over each other, without having to settle."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms at full height - with lots of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic coupling window of retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored Goldfurniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program."</seg>

<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units space for all the corner and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan of the stahlreinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is obvious, so it when you push the door, very easily gvert."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever usage of space and storage room, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond to negative press sections, especially those with defective leaps, and that he will find out how these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone found the vice-provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-provocation rod in Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap of leaks in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he was expressed in the past, and vowed them in the past."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet with their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa, through which organised crime, corrupted officials and unceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more safe: they should take their children with their office, which were the goal of an attack with granates, or let them leave at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutrale, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"if you ask the reporters, suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abs."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs, politicians, businessmen, businessmen, journalists who are suspected on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there are no more journalists from violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are ever more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 have taken his office at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, its editors and your inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">The greatest mistake is to live and journalist in Mexico and wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which marks his middle-finger with the word" Justice ". two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the journalists discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmare, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a Sonder-Bundesanwald was established to deal with the cases of journalists, these according to the committee to protect journalists was initiated only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders associated with drug trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still persist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforted and even though the terrain is now still traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefits to discuss the security of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we mistrust."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the paper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive it only a few blocks away, until his roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced from his car and 12 times were shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Tweld river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlements of the country, since rivaling factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of vertically, two-story Mausoleen for drugs royal ones who are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'tranquility' if only one cartel control over the coastal enstaat with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, there was the publication of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling carton in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez not to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had released the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues would always be there to be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for the Northwest in 2003 when he joined Riodoce with five colleagues on the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the crawry problem," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it to publish hard accurate studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which no one else had to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for protecting journalists on the persecution of the Mexican drugs history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trading in Sinaloa" is a lifestyle, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You need to take the task that falls as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went before?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun-bird, who cursed like a dockers, the friend, the generous with hugs and ratings, a teacher who knew how to survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite to the office, go to the table and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she ask: was his love of routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions regarding how they can do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you do not like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny and Landecars, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are not considered as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees met by Riodoce were not allowed any mobile phones. days previously, Spyware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-range area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen that the Governor itself considered untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone to the mountain, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has led to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the government spending, which focused on the hometown of the Governors."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was offered as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled almost all the political planes."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors have been accused of impaired cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporters about previous incidents in this eatery, including a one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went a military overfall."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months previously, the readers had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body statur. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to storage room for signs and stickers to protest against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become more powerful, having written in organised protests" SOS Press "on walking distance and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez the authorities to pronounce journalists and let them embrace it because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has since then asked that it is divided once again by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has wounded their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico from organised crime, committed to involved governmental officials and an equal society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco journalist" "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who have been organized with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, Articulo 19" "Articulo 19" "was assigned more than half of the attacks against journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you live, because they want you to watch the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>

<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly directed to drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology, "recorded him as" the said dinous dinosaurs, who ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosauosaurs that lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers, who describe it as" "really remarkable", "</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant nurses the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the place, and decided to see more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) serious Earth clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinzeln a little with the eyes you could almost believe that it has slept," said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of Dinosere.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this crop-eaters, although he is covered with an armor tank, probably threatened by meat, probably threatened by meat."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is used as contrasts, which are also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to soak its enemies, say experts which indicates that it was threatened by larger diners."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosauosaurs family made the headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild beast and studied Borealopelta market mitchelli after the Museumsteer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to expose it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of scales and armaments on his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta by far the animals live above."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of enough pressure by meat freshing dinosaurs was hunted that the evolution favored the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of contemporary animals, which apply the counter-shaded - think of deer, zebras or girt - are much smaller and hurting as loot, which signalizes that this Nodosauosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs have to have been the chalk predators of the chalk time," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including its conserfourth Darminhaltes to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs when he died, turned into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosauosaurs is really remarkable because it remains completely covered with conveyed skin, but also in three dimensions and the original form of the animal keeps", "Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost as exactly as it is in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is in sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, as huge theropoden, carnivorous dinosere, which rose on two legs, the earth went through."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta lived, the paired dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was enshrined after death in the sea, and in mud mumified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the said dinosaur dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips."</seg>

<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this particular specimen are so well received that the skin remains still bumpy tank along the diners cover</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lotto."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that has experienced almost everyone at once: nothing flusingly sits on the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the Schaffner and wakes an improper or irritating the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Card control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon gone.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn are currently creating ticket-card check-out.</seg>

<seg id="1995">"currently, a test is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes to, we extend it out."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it is then expected to be available in Germany early next year," said a railway speaker. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is called the rail card devaluation with no work.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements need to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - what already most of the passengers already do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to purchase it via the app of the railway, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works: one climbs into the train, his ticket is called" My ticket. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">In the test customers then a button for electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train guides get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X has been located on the train and taken the seat seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train companion when driving card control at place Y he knows that there is a passenger with already unworthless online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, continue to continue, remain silent."</seg>

<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often drives railway, knows that besides delays and missed, the ticket controls are among the biggest dietary results."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for often one has himself, but in any case one of the fellow traveller does not need all the documents that you need for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either is missing the credit card or the personal identification, or otherwise a document that you have to predict."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result are endless discussions between migrating leaders and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the part or large room and delays in control of their own tickets and the creativity at the end takes time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">"on 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core."</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street," she called there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on her fened, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly being saved on their Timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year ago, who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., killed live in live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lebloous body that was spread on the road and would stay there four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," "she thought to himself."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was for her and her community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, who cried out, and by a man who said to be Browns Father, who carried a sign with the wording:" Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live-feed in which a policeman is faced with a group of demonstrators with a bellishing dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, escaped a different policeman his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "reminded of their statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and that we are typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shame.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11 am, she fetched her 6-year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestants, of love and loss, the strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a pigrell with her daughter, who brought a flower-dress and a suitable crown to go to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you recall how I have taught, when black people have to fight for the fight to believe in them?" "they remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the lucky enough to give her an experience in which they are personally not experienced a eklatted racism, it is not unlike the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep them away from them."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station when she arrived in Ferguson Road, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was engaged in a campground, as the activists on the possible non-accusation of officer Wilson warmed."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there were Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and hallowed to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly started a new kind of activism for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on Essens justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met in an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came about Ferrell in the meaning:" "do you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from white - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already worked together with the former Co-director, Damon Davis, an artist from the field, known for its activism around Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell's project closer, along with six other locals followed the team of" "Whose Streets?" "in the years after Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">That was the main thing for me as these people are represented because I will be represented.</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah leader, but to a community that comes together," Folayan, she turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of ferells' life as they love themselves and marries their wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be certain vulnerability at this work and in the Menshevik of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells' history has repeated history the role of black bumps women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Tray of Martin in 2012 had shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as sulphul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it is however that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "at the piglets, due to their identity as the heart of the film was chosen."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who spelled this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front front as it was in front of a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is a demonstration for 2 ½ years due to the blockage of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that they call their home: "a mess.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she cloned herself to a singing, and she feels committed to this memory since it was three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, though it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian street, since the first presentation 2009, the population has been put into advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"also on our Facebook-page" "popular and Bitburg" "the subject is discussed."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one thing about the bit-gallery say," This would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real class "(" Anja Becker) "or" That would be real class "(" Anja Becker) "or" That would be real class "(" "Anja Becker)", "or quite simply:" "size wahn!" "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates insisted that a gallery will take more customers into the city, which also attracts the rest of the business, fear the opponents that then blew the pedestrian bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned precisely on the property, on which the peasant market hall is, in the 13 direct market-market-market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction will be a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - with a possibility to go outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping for many years almost weekly in the farmer's hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farms always like to be very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market entry in a Markthalle in the gallery enters the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But that is likely to be low at the new project but not just low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why Commercial Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"if clothing, shoes, drume- or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shop stores here stand empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekly market here, it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered here is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the manufacturer and is very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, Ladenstores are reserved in a shopping basket only by larger companies, because the dorms are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops are almost no longer and what is left of it, then it will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a Markthalle fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - also for duration when the bit-gallery actually occurs sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the specter bit gallery previously to sell all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, also no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, yes, thanks to the wahnsinful many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no room more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant markthalle is made, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">One suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can see - white, black and brown, which are almost invariably identical - that are dependent on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen Tupfern and hair sections that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst gave a 35-year-year arrest warrant, after having found diplomatic messages on the site WikiLeaks publicly."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition which was opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer science and art, as he had been transformed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg was created by the DNA analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning and made from the thirty portraits, as someone could look at the formability of DNA data - the many ways of how it can be interpreted, and the indurated determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly spoken about identification as a woman, it was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations of the espionage Act, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grandeur, black-white Selfie, in the Manning is clearly sitting on a driver's seat, and a platelblonde Perücke carries - with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of its 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their incarcerated Muse were made to unequal brilliance that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they created even one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" "Suppressed Images", "which would foresee a future that would transform the President Chelta's judgement and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven brutal years ago was a welcome kind of happy encounter."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat lowly and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid divisions, which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen out of a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written by his superior testimony (the" i "in their family name called" "i" "in their family name, called" "the" "in their family name, called on with one heart) an end to the" automatic defragmentation whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall her mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thoughtfully of Cs and gs and As is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"showing Dewey-Hagborg, hoping to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nustiotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), like amazingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it, is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned comic novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a release-star in the hand of the disciplinarkasary of the United States such as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they address your speech, they have won" "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that it wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be foreseen in the comic book, but if they should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by their own genomic simulacrum which collapses like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposed, as everything in the exhibition, through to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic Haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, who formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also hidden behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2228">"now, as the company Convercent uses, can problems that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unselfish practitioner, are identified faster and addressed."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can arrive closer to this holistic, 360-degree vision in the experience of employment," "says Vitrano who manages the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday."</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment - legal disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">"company began to take ethics, ethics, values and employee involvement in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations through the Enron scandal, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it lasted until the" Social Media came to their right, "that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online."</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors both supported start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">"the Convercent was awarded $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures, Tola Capital, which raised the entire capital to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>

<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more to be expected from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">"in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets."</seg>

<seg id="2245">Data about the staff's commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it can have a expectation that changes on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, these disappointments can be trained and presented."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past the little Scotney Castle was visible in a squeeze music video and was a slip hole in 1970-he and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years turbulent history of its cozy seat at Bewl River valley in Kent and now is an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mopararigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful, to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years, he says weeping."</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'undisturbed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney - Isaac Lenkiewicz, William Lenkiewicz, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb on the side of a letter, which was written by a double-car in the 1700-year-years who was working for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always come to smoke, because at that time they had a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he was even involved."</seg>

<seg id="2302">"for someone who is, so with old papists, he is being supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and almost four months in a castle (" To be honest ") this is all too nice to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian" "new" "castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the moniled hybridal heads in the walls and the bottles had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, and talked with landscaped, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists, who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night drank" whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust first received full access as the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, wires on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English, cards which, who possessed," "you might think that country-conflict would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let everything go up!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a wider base in the English history, including'The Labourer ', which leaves a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion, the 1380 in the castle, entered this book with the title 'Knife de of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the farmer started in this area and I thought, an uprising was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are connected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it cannot be crazy, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotik) (FRR) report a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritized professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people get fun, but the companies will get lots of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuds have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicate skin that feels warm-feeling - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs," and thereby select everything from the eye's color over the form of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still disturbing, since many robots have the" personalities "that would give a Stepford-wife progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuds have developed to robots with a silicate skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they find, such as bulk solids."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of relapse and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and they don't like what you do not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed on conversation, or it can" "be in the mood!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects with this climb from sex robots - not least because they will replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties, the playings on rape when one step up on Frigid (is here: conflicting) Farrah, beunquiet one on most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True, the Roxxxy was in a vibration with a vibration, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then have no roxxxy?" is it called on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just another sex."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as optionale encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most of the men will of course not hold a sex robot, and while the FRR will remember their increasing popularity, they still persist in the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates out of the edge of the edge, may be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, be very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until they give the free market permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is yet a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time wherein the women's rights are threatened in the White House, who knows for women to have sexually attacked women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the slipped body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity with actual women as realistic as technically possible (although also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">They want their inheritance to feel human beings to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robot does not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they do not have a mediation or a background story, nothing that could interfere with independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subjugation."</seg>

<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and harvest, there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of trump-elected relatives."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House is everyone who knows it, including the Republican kinship, with which they fought for decades, suddenly and quite independent on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"in order for the dining table, this certainly is a good thing, but it falls into a further context that it brings considerable risks to itself."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the levelling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the grossest way that his toll of one day will no longer be hooked."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is still a reinstantaneous long-time scenario, in the trump Republicans of the right wing" normalized "that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of denial."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation of intestinal disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition in the USA affects some 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are normally advised to relieve flesh and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the guiding researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, which are capable to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice, which carry a specific bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial microbiome - Lactobacillus Disteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at tryptophan supports tolerant, less inflammatory bowel if the same system will be wirelessly with humans."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immunocell that promotes tolerance than they found out that a group of study belts had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which was separated, but that did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal traction.</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the dry of the mice were decorated DNA sequences and were found six species of bacterial species that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were reared into a sterilen environment so that they were missing a intestinal microbiom, and they did not produce these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria depended on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transmits small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immunocells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan Metabolism, known as Indol-3-anthology."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the forage of the mice double, the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent, but if the number of cells declined around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people protect the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri can protect from us in our stomach-intestinal traction.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-outeri products from L. reuteri are developing the cells in humans such as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, since these cells are controlled inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptopicity can lead to an expansion of these population."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the decision of the White House, a navel helicopter to fly to the South Lawn for an event which highlights American production in the last month, takes taxpayers to the details of the military, which were left to TIME Magazin, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky vH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July at the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Leader of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter was created next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklifts from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed at the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit, which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I only wanted to be aware that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility, the commander of the HMX-1 was written on the eve of the event of his superiors, Deputy Prime Minister for aviation."</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the Helicopter arrived at 7 p.m. in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long remained before the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure should be delayed out of the White House, due to the limitation of the hours a second team would require for return flight."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight meeting was during the event at the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the period."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from which the TIME provided, it was not clear whether a second flight student was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act provides state-of-the-art property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could injure the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked, was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "said the deputy commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impulse for the reform of health reform that was going on in the Senate, and he pushed the efforts to suspend the government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the plane, which is known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly beneficial for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">President are obligated to use them for the journey.</seg>

<seg id="2742">"a spokesman of Sikorsky said, the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not operate Budgetary designations for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to Standentarifen of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017, the DOD supplement for the vH-3D amounts to the vH-3D for the vH-3D but 24.380 USD per flight."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"records of unity see the flight time of the plane, 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Virginia."</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter go far under this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the costs of taxpayers to be set on the basis of estimates for the income distribution is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study of 2015, the revenues for DOD do not contain the personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spell, the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I go out that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tireless.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to note that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump intercepted with the helicopter, when he entered his round about the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fireman account."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and wrote the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2886">"it may well be good after the accident, that the Merano-drivers did not notice the accident at all."</seg>
<seg id="2887">"the police ask the police for all the witnesses of the preload, as well as the driver of the causal experience, taking place at tel. 05761 / 92060 to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report disburdens Pope Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The Final Report for the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissenders, spokesperson for the Repress Movement" We are Church, "stated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Benedict XVI, an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve to the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller und Ratzinger would strongly express its deepest regret about its own omissions, or their back then wrong evaluation of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano" "criticized that in reporting on violence at the domain splash with" two measures "measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt nobody that must be punished and shameful acts; however, the" degree medial manipulation "," says the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethic Committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of labeling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of all-day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it for normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" you will be happy to go on to the church, and this is a sweeping fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" beats a very normal pedagogical means "" to be done with frechen children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they exist unfair, current standards on earlier decades, because the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports about the abuse cases, the Pope Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann who complied with Ratzinger the reminder band" My brother of Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take George Ratzinger in protection," says Hemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he values the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which is presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification of lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were spelled from 1945 to the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibilities" victims of assault, 67 domain spying sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it is possible to cling that by Domcapellmeister R. in many cases forms physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment could also be severe for the students."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even to connect positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann, why the Final Report on the abuse of the rainbow Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger calls for his opinion unloaded."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of violence appointed by the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to a lift, many pupils emerge his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who was hand-hand to the Öfteren, when a domain name musically took no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you describe this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you are doing the trouble and read the whole 440 page long report from front to the back, one has to ask yourself rather, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all found in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted from every suspicion of the Mittler- or Mitknowing in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of poetry at the preschool occurred outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can pre-throw it at all, from which too late or first lawyers do not have taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domain of the domain, on which it worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally -" "salvation", "" "sky" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the wide majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents a very good witness," "popular", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent", "" "competent"</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about its perfectionist and its high emotionality, which also led to woutches."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he was not only shared with chairs, and cast the keys and cast on the ground, but also swallows guys in the hair or ears, he has already given years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honor of salvation, however, must be said that such tutors in the survey time, the 1960s, and 1970s were widely used, with parents like teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think of each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"also I have experienced this in a secular school, a state of school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what this is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the power of violence at the preschschule, are of the certainly dreatars."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"when one asks oneself, whether it is not more with its familiarity and role as the brother of Benedict XVI from Benedict XVI, that many of the media have just returned to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"on the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still diligently off."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report disburdens Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, we reported a lot about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"Georg Ratzinger will also be placed in the Final Report as well, as in terms of sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to become acquainted with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never sinned myself to speak with my father or mother," "said a person for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with educating sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent from shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would like to become a colleague of the perpetrators, for a professional career."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable disciple formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have been timely and the respective perpetrators would have been able to stop.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that there is rested, or clearer or even more likely, than compared to their parents, internats, trust instructors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" that the students involved in advance and / or whose environment trusted, could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"so, what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak from every co-learning."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused, not being prevented or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to get his good name in connection with these contradictory crime, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "violence" eating during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was pre-cast in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed up and deceives became a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what is the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there is therefore clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of dominion, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other prediers."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers pre-incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leaders of the domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful inspectors, the cases in which Knaben of sawler teachers were transducted and malnourished and among them were deficient, unattended all at the preschschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with that, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain of the domain."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as the most witnesses emphasise the theme" "Vorschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain name?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but just not a savious violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even to connect positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at the most still remains the rebel, looked off."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two time periods where he was reported by the states at the Vorschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish and from the events at a school where he just did not work and he was responsible, and then again and again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Mixed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain name council, which the report even reproduces."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out to it," that the inspectors continue to practice in the pre-school. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the risk of negative press coverage, he received urgent advance."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when testing was banned also in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that they occurred in a legal area, as everyone of us probably still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him, where the affected may be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can not say, he has always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the examiner was officially officially made in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards on the time of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk of the" "pitstrick of Anachronism", "thus the danger, past this is the danger of today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The intercystine has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school and violence against innocels, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terribly and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his funds for disciplining and punishment, therefore ear-peers and to pull in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment then was banned, he has also kept strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what's the picture of his rainbow time, Georg Ratzinger has played in the talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope? ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic checkweighed also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, as the domain throats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not at all that he led to a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must once again be said: without this perfectionist, without demanding unrelated discipline, it would hardly ever have been possible from that until then quite nationally-known Regensburger Domspatzen, an institution of world transcending, true cultural leaders in Europe (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons, one does not even make a great singer and every success in which area, however, always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man have you experienced for the book George Ratzinger for the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and over and over again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faithful and heartfelt good people, from whom you could not imagine that he could only do a fly-to-fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with, as many former domesatzen still today, 23 years after his empowerment, he regularly read him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgive him today, that he was once more strict, so are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he was always a good, patterous teacher - a stricter father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which she still look at her today and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and, please, again clear: everything you proach to him, are the guardians that were at the time of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is a prominent, and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intention that stands behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was published just, entail him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the attacks, a 93-year-old man, who acquired great service and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen to leave finally in peace."</seg>
