Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
this clearly was clear to Hollywood Star in an interview .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or live from the outside label , which often have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather sn@@ apshots . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is regarded as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the best spends the act@@ ress for her time at home , m TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , is it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the whit@@ ut , she is asking the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we women have to not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new movie &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child game &quot; is An@@ iston as a single mother of two sons .

Golden Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a bit variety with some colleagues on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses were reminded of their fes@@ tivities , they j@@ umped into the fast g@@ allo@@ p home in the fast g@@ allo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and in this way the horse@@ men ended up again then again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament si@@ ege - again close to horses .
&quot; he left himself with his family on the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t get time for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was really convincing .
the German sports help ran@@ ged the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gala with the Golden Sports pyramid .
on awards it is not a sympathetic athle@@ te .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ et@@ akers , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already served him .
the 18th is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is awarded not only for spor@@ tive successes but also for socially commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been working for Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro immediately .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time master master was recorded on Saturday in the Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
&quot; the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ sters Hart@@ mut Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Ru@@ ner Eber@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the j@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ crafted Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ e society emigr@@ ated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ az@@ za price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger lasted far to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ umps economic compared : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential statements are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
who has the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubts rather small and warns that as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wool the economy to death in death and to regulate death he says .
&quot; he himself would be completely different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return to regulations , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
Clinton against it says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil ; he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money .
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say nearly wor@@ t@@ equal . &quot;
the democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; so , you could still have partial internal discussions . &quot;
&quot; clearly , the differences in the energy and climate policies are clear . &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ power plants and re@@ drive the coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas that wants to announce the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; Clinton on the other hand wants to expand and encourage renewable energy with its investment programme , &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only at the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreements , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US does not want to isol@@ ate international trade by international trade - but simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; the should then be paid better , calls for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wages .
she wants to increase her on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump in this question wants , is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him before , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every little woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women , who flee alone , almost for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby who is at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother lay down on the top plate .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene affects normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the department of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and among other things , deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are stra@@ ined .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has taken care of the furnishings along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s women &apos;s aid .
&quot; un@@ long ago , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not excessive to say : every woman who arrives here has taken on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are being pursued politically because they torture torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ eless@@ ness to Europe , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; in women there were other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ als secretly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , constraints , honorary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tractor for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , the women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferi@@ or and worse if mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in Munich to the north , traumati@@ zed them . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary created . &quot;
many women were so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust , talking about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not help you know , it will need more accommodations just for them . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area , some answer with no . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken around there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments .
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , only found women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common accommodation units or own houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if privacy or men and women are accommodated together , it may be - constant - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women easily , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women of this protection might be felt , one can read the urge that there is in Munich on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has been talking about , we have a long queu@@ ed list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant Stri@@ ped : demands for new work@@ flow measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; representative of the Assist@@ ants have called on their trade union to cont@@ end new employment measures with their disputes on a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council as early as early September .
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there would be Minister @-@ dreamed , to address the concerns about the contract . &quot;
assistance and medical students have agreed in July on the rejection of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained silent about problems , which resulted in the contract . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and demands official new negotiations on all aspects . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government today , the J@@ DC Board has placed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to escal@@ ate a fast program escal@@ ators , starting in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to this year , that at the end of the year , assistant practitioners of the year six@@ sm@@ al coinci@@ ded , the first overall incidents in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the vote on the ref@@ usal of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , who were still taking place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance and medical students , with that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of outdoor later@@ als &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart to the St. Petersburg Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace &apos;s palace in reception , I cannot resist the expression that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ ur@@ ry sm@@ ur@@ ry and shining a little bit of heat , even for its backward conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but can even improve .
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never happen something bad .
his enthusiasm seemed to be more of the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
rather the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his con@@ fession : the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ ated .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara to please Russia in their backs .
&quot; it was even greater , since it was committed by a alleged friend . &quot;
building the veins will be re@@ building difficult when not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ resolved attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed to carry out the Turks for all that blame .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an ap@@ ology from the President Erdo@@ gan which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are clearly on hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan requires first and foremost all the friends he can get after he dis@@ missed the last month at a curved coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number has gone back by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ seasonal an@@ storm of the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week forecast , the state television fores@@ ees fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demographic sti pointed out the following way : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an extra political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because its response to the tried @-@ to @-@ use of power has been seen as a weak response .
&quot; in addition , the continued Gro@@ ll about the sn@@ acking @-@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is to pull out the cool mood and l@@ essen the relation of Turkey to the West . &quot;
Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty for sure that he asked for the tried state of state aid to the elected government .
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a sense of understanding , even deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible to represent Russia and Turkey , as a analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of external later@@ als &quot; &quot; : two countries that are rejected and badly treated by the West and now fade away . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace stand , but where Russia and Turkey support antagon@@ isms . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions , both presidents spoke at the press conference , that they could not even comprehend the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey for@@ mi@@ ed it deliberately to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where to find a common den@@ omin@@ ator to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given the potential for a perfection , the NATO member Turkey of the Russian martial jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of heads at least come back to one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank Council , R@@ BS shall be reduced more to a back@@ office role according to the Board President of the Bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the global ambitions of the bank were connected .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself when she had almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved .
&quot; at this time , brand str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; has used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial marks . &quot;
&quot; it supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be employed to our Invest@@ ors &apos; brand , as well as the brand where our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now , that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be entirely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be six Nations sponsor@@ ing no longer and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop on the bank of the brands , as we have asked ourselves to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board President . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and brought these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will be many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can return these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;

&quot; he placed on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ etr@@ ack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ god , Pat Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy about it in New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the j@@ ubil@@ ation when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4.@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ er@@ ful career .
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern era and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is its tactical intel@@ lect , which makes it different from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans for years for this sport . &quot;

&quot; from flying finishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British flat for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wr@@ acking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ rich Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his branches , and to return to his bri@@ gh@@ test . &quot;
and he still has a long time not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russia Putin boo@@ sted Staff by Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made un@@ expect@@ edly his rod leader Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest associate of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has been arranged by his duties as the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s was appointed as his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the renowned National Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy of Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later called on protocol and director of the government member . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think that the government is the most important task of the government , to support your activity as a stat@@ ute in terms of implementation and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV transm@@ itter on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow Myst@@ eri@@ ous .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest conspir@@ ators Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet Intelligence that K@@ GB .
&quot; as a rod , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Staff chief is back on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is what nobody knows .
but the official claim - that a man who was once more directed to the Russian environmental policy - came to a great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , Ivan@@ ov said , Ivan@@ ov said , Ivan@@ ov said , Ivan@@ ov said , Ivan@@ ov said that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was deputy prime minister and Minister of Defense . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) was the president of the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin , he called off in power as Putin called he Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had to violate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken from another , closer allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he was re @-@ president for three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry cross@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the north deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ roads with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four resolutions of the &quot; cover blo@@ wer , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons concrete , as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ sei@@ le . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister , Keit@@ h Brown stat@@ oned the construction site today visited a visit today and was one of the first to went on the bridge from the country . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ roads .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering structure of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the delay between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the whole bridge finished in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks is now in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , meaning that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure has been a significant milestone in each Br@@ ücken@@ project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure of trend @-@ setting high@@ - and deep @-@ construction is . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street stops , and its connection with the right in the expansion of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 millimeters .
this was a massive one and at the same time very delicate work .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 meters long is , ca . 6,000 tons and at a slope of approx . 3 % had to be drawn up . &quot;
&quot; delicate , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny , on each side they bore only a few mil@@ lim@@ etres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men still have &quot; happiness to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness nor being alive &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown down by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck a Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around herself and made us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have taken the boat out of their range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bo@@ je without b@@ ail@@ out there . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coast of the coast and were brought back to the life@@ station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water were lucky to be un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot @-@ engine had an emergency one , however , however , when the bo@@ wels of the Bo@@ ots were bound by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has wondered about these men today .
difficult hurt - man sti@@ cking to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , cut off the alcoholic , the clothing of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he added twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and by the body .
the police could take the do@@ ings .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old clothes were destroyed of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
these aler@@ ts as well as his sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner out of the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life of the man .
&quot; when the two women joined the apartment , the two @-@ year @-@ old one of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Greens mean : investors are going to be much stronger in the duty of the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 @-@ cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next R@@ ats@@ creen . &quot;
but arguments is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Greens : who wants to build on urban areas , in future , 20 percent of all apartments must be dealt with as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also occur in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big dispute in the Town Hall is however , thus Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban residential building program , which will cost millions and will still be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , thus Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few provisions as possible .
the left will still have hardness conditions for investors .
&quot; regardless of it , thus Brat@@ mann , make a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation in the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; the action concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we get the specialists .
&quot; yet the program is not entirely up @-@ to @-@ date : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; how do you change the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , promoting the promotion over the next few years ? &quot;
only up to 2020 will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , the planning @-@ policy spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the town . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back to the pricing again . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
on one stroke will be able to solve the problem .
for the end of the Western city run by the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the pricing for affordable housing there .
only : these are the owners who do not want construction companies .
&quot; after all , the number of social housing in the West town is again dramatically increased , one can be removed from the target of the so @-@ called through@@ mixing . &quot;
there will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Greens expect that there will be even more exercise in the discussion .
&quot; group leader , Chairman Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must have with the boat . &quot;
these have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; for Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and get more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters of the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop@@ culture sank interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players with their smartphones go outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons who are following a GPS and once found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , closed to W@@ ahn and sprang out for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person has returned every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , a app for Apple Watch that followed 3@@ 5.000 users , the Washington Post reported recently that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of subsequent people , each day , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped . &quot;
the company does not know who plays this Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the rough data on performance .
&quot; many public awareness campa@@ igning on health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; to get involved &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and every day to be active on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring and come from people who look el@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who is regularly driving sports , reduces its chances to be ill to cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonder@@ full at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there are also m@@ u@@ rous playing , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
and yes . someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drift sports as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its attraction and the use will be eliminated with time .
&quot; due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people at the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ it@@ ress kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ voy Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro 2016 during the single majority of women at the Olympic Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American singer , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth , while they solidi@@ fy their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey in this moment was an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has won over the last three years , dominates the last three years , 15 World medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton told by her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected a last test in Brazil , a competition which did not go so much between the rest and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American dairy Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace themselves after they have won gold and silver at the Olympic Summer 2015 at Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday , ... &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while she served at the farewell ceremony of the reti@@ ring of reti@@ re , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; although it ins@@ isted during their long way@@ side to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of its soil exercises - which includes their typical Tum@@ my Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , which was adopted by their grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing flu@@ ent to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became the power . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2013 , she has won no longer competition competition since the summer 2013 , a triumph@@ ant series that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ af@@ ina led by two screen@@ ings , dec@@ ayed the image . &quot;
pig @-@ beams and bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es the world championship holds - lau@@ ghed .
they returned again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ beam - and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her gently as she anticipated her En@@ der@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that it once was described in their collective book . &quot;
&quot; the Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze aille went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , which is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her mineral exercise , she cast the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ fires , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared without doubt . &quot;

police : 3 victims of mass incident in the car have shot in the car
&quot; according to the police report , published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girls have shot up in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of mass attack , while sitting in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ted in a drive , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator eight shots from a hand@@ fire @-@ weapon , while on the passenger side of the car stood and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the triple murder had not been the result of a prey , since the att@@ acker did not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the re@@ fr@@ enz@@ y re@@ directed the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , predominantly in Hisp@@ anic dormit@@ ories of four months in nine attacks seven persons were killed and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , has been hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died on the spot . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
the authorities published also a police report on the sli@@ des@@ y that was raised to an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and that it came out that it was the work of the series .
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ sen , and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 years love Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of its anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy was nothing knew . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time came home , my first thought , I did not make this . &quot;
I don &apos;t make this .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one let yourself be left , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund never will recognize it under certain circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institu@@ tion@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a salary .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor sc@@ ram@@ bling up to his third year and he cannot talk .
but he is doing slow progress .
he can run and cycling with support .
he loves it also with his two brothers to play and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the pron@@ unciation , which has become Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; Please tell me something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him character in &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical speech -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as mascul@@ inity or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of using the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know it really .
I haven &apos;t asked about the prognosis for a long time because I did not expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ d@@ ment gives rise to b@@ umps in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
fierce rainf@@ all and large @-@ surface floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to rest on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the move pp@@ is flooded , with large @-@ surface floods after extreme rainf@@ all , reported the National Wetter@@ dienst . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared with that state officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and help the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ation of the Govern@@ ors , divided that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multiplied . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said , that the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a has been calling for ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service allowed to fall in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain .
&quot; in the South of Alab@@ ama , a fleet was used on Friday , while it ra@@ ined in the area in the area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will reach all probability over the weekend record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be flooded in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ ward flood flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these are slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 the highest level , who ever was recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still stra@@ ined people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the South@@ west of Mississippi River .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water is removed from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet from his home overnight . &quot;
he said that him had a further step@@ son who lives near to dwell .
&quot; we are awakened and the water finished and left in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a high stand of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members were able to have all the disabilities and he would be the only ones who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that not@@ hel@@ fer would have saved all three in a great military truck , and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods had extended &quot; rapidly , &quot; as there was still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions in consideration . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer held near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground through the rainf@@ all since Wednesday was considerably accomplished .
the authorities believed that severe rainf@@ alls and street as@@ hes the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and classes in five schools .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a bei@@ ro in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 survived houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which now both were flooded .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets who were stra@@ ined from the floods , to the floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency arrivals have been appointed to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two d@@ wind@@ ling streets were closed due to the flood and sand so@@ ckets for the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in addition , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continues on the golf course . &quot;
&quot; according to his details , a handful of houses on Thursday should be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but on Friday have not been registered . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived sli@@ des@@ y in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave us the grandparents that Brown suffered several weak@@ ening injuries , including in the rounds , leg , arm and tum@@ my , but that he was with his transport to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was sculp@@ ted by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe .
the state of the boy was classified as a critical hospital in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter with that it is expected to be back again .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front @-@ seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year old , which is found in a critical state , reported on the transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not in the car and the police are determined , whether under one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be found . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a crus@@ fire between multiple sho@@ oters .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for storm we@@ eds , which were res@@ cu@@ ed back to different storm arch@@ ers , s@@ wir@@ es the fact . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a question of lasting struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walking , were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; in this way it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police officers , p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there came to no arrest , and the police are scrut@@ ini@@ zed according to reports according to reports . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl was taken by a clo@@ wer at the arm when they played in front of the West O@@ ak Lane in front of her house . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a suspi@@ cion .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I took place under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ ic office and this for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been at every summer olymp@@ ic since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is , round , makes every proud . &quot;
this team has finally reflected the United States .
it has been the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ o was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ erin .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this indicates strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics winning and America was che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , yet master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ in@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American singer , who won gold for women in an individual multi @-@ campaign event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but you cannot see cycle classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it to the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; you are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ors will have only four tur@@ ner@@ ers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ning a more expensive sport is and Tur@@ ner will be maintained primarily in private turn@@ around , which are maintained for training , furniture , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and that is for families a real and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired to the communities of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to provide a performance and more easily accessible training . &quot;
I founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have trained free and affordable tur@@ quoise in Harlem for about 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand into Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality turbines , which earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; turbine develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline , and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of these crew , who bring thousands of young girls who are interested in turmoil and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Mann@@ it@@ gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant practitioners would like to organize other strikes after they rejected Hun@@ ting Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through acceptance of a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ alities of British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 3@@ 7@@ ,000 assistants who voted on a choice , refused him . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans revealed to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS had ordered itself in a &quot; &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay to the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
the first assistant artists should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend contributions to improve the maintenance of un@@ certain@@ ties .
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the President of the BM@@ A Kom@@ mit@@ aries shared last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; Assist@@ ants received last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; assistance professionals at the proposed contract &quot; &quot; at the proposed agreement , particularly that it is to deal with the current occupancy crisis and administered them to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for only eight weeks , who remain still staying until the first group of doctors were under the new contract , progress will have to be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A efforts by the BM@@ A to solve any disputes caused by the government to participate in the government and sometimes silence on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise , the Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t , only last month , that his door would always be off@@ beat . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t has to act now to raise the penetration and address the worries of the assistance professionals .
&quot; should he do this , so have made it clear to the Assist@@ ants that they are ready to carry out further work procedures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a push of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to cover doctors on the strike post@@ p@@ ette . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through the acceptance of the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ alities of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better vo@@ icing for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant who are subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistant to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labor amp@@ ires do not reach nothing of the little ones , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing care and their families only worry , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the com@@ promises of the assistant who spoke with the Ministry of Health and other ministries , which responded positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and of the wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as un@@ posting , flexibility in training , training sessions and gender equality in medicine - a sign of the employer , Health Education England and Health Department concerning the observ@@ ance of the agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart @-@ related patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after the authorities have been recommended to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the ag@@ inn@@ ed medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the Reg@@ ul@@ ators of the N@@ HS suggested four years for a long time to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the Reg@@ ul@@ ators of the N@@ HS suggested four years for a long time to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year , and a quarter of which suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations of accum@@ ulations in the arteries that are har@@ row .
&quot; when the Bel@@ ag breaks apart , it can cause a blood flow that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood @-@ inn@@ sel trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood stream and flow blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca , is reduced by the British company Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cells un@@ probable . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tion of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with an twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Care Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ a@@ str@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in the reduction of further heart attack and perc@@ ussion with people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to expand the treatment options available to thousands of people , which can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the management design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor &apos;s culture can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year on dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report , due to corruption from the office . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ts has led to that far @-@ proliferation electoral was kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities such as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member of Sir Eric Pick@@ les shall refer to the police , electoral and Rath@@ geber , to have evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now a antagon@@ rup@@ tible , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to protect , dis@@ connected voters outside of electoral voters to protect their voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a statement to themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes before , do not remove ink on the finger of a person when they give their choice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal facilities and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ partments or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against election but should also protect the municipal government before the broader corruption and financial crisis culture , which goes with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral campaign as a result of the east of London .
last year decided a special court that the official Mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was supposed to become the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man has per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; &quot; and that he would have expressed his critics with Rass@@ is@@ sm@@ al and Islam@@ ophobia accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ im@@ ous duty of Moslems to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which a person chooses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there would be a proof of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself an alar@@ ming stamp - in the older members of Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the fo@@ als to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of a number of ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in particular , in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ yr@@ ish background . &quot;
&quot; there was concerns that ... state institutions would have ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; super@@ sensitive li@@ abilities regarding eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists are op@@ tionally edit to stop &quot; &quot; harvest harvesting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May is also required for tougher registration over that the electoral directory is used for im@@ migr@@ atory and social fraud purposes .
consider options in consideration to ask voters before choosing the choice .
&quot; not to remove ink on the finger of a person , once they have given their voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
systematic review on the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit limit to an automatic mailbox .
prohibition that political activ@@ ates complete stamp elections and envel@@ opes of the stamp elections .
the police give authority to set up p@@ ies for electoral stations .
a legislative change that facilitates an indictment for intimi@@ dation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Economics Act 1983 ) .
photography offered in electoral stations .
requirement that only English in the constitu@@ ents may be used ( except for Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the staff will push the rule that voters go alone into the electoral plan . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets no spell was placed . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has l@@ acked Lut@@ le@@ man and his deputy for a li@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
it was due to a number of reasons for sufficient reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critici@@ zed the un@@ effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the Elec@@ toral College of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears the mother of the parliaments a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered spread of constitu@@ ency and denial of some authorities threatening this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double @-@ Magazine and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week about the French cyclists of Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band who turned out to be impressive col@@ der in the Du@@ gin of Cambridge .
&quot; but the twenty @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to give gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one can give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , created at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ oni@@ ans who have more than just a certain similarity with wood . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates double @-@ in on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people on the internet pointed out how to be a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave to hear that he has already been to hear since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I do not see a great similarity , except the facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I probably do that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 this year will undoubtedly have the focus : the open similarity between Britain &apos;s far @-@ jum@@ pers Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ress Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes shall be able to go through a col@@ on for the Cub@@ an American singer @-@ American singer . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ ni@@ pped skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the act@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , during the American Nathan Adrian Adrian of fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others are similar similarities to others
theory added to the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter almost identical . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was used on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that she was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment of time to apologi@@ ze for the comment I told after the women &apos;s swimming staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , to apologi@@ ze , he said . &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark be@@ un@@ disturbed about woman who tried in the heart of the store
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered them as they saw in it , drawn them out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious wife had tried the ling@@ erie , she moved back and left business without doing anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the selling surface , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the board , drawn up their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little discreet place to do it - it simply stood there , nau@@ ghty like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ red , when they turned the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not please , as they put them into the shelf again . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that her nothing fell to come back and went out .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to bother that they are watching someone watching - or thinking about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants , which they had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have brought , the staff tries to draw the garments out of sale , after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants , and find out that another woman she had and returned , and they were not washed . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you .
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to get around with armed rob@@ bers near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate for your predat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; if you turn to you from the back then you should turn out to be the first , so you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon between your front @-@ arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the bar and rot@@ ate you , while the att@@ acker caught up with pain , the weapon made out of his hands . hit him with the run and move back@@ wards while she will judge the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; when approaching the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift simultaneously the weight of the weapon and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then rot@@ ate the weapon from his handle , before moving back@@ wards and direct the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ power .
but remember that there is a smoking at the safest way to over@@ head your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
travel@@ er Ian Wright det@@ ects his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went its immune system and thro@@ li@@ ef@@ le@@ x of a serious examination - by imposing some of the dirty and disgu@@ sting places of Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel agency Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ aded his course on a Euro Sch@@ ein , a ro@@ cking at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ure on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink or a public telephone in Russia to proof the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
in front of each object he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to be in .
&quot; but the experiment , which was identified under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; some surprising results were brought to day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the flush kno@@ b has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact it is in a kitchen rin@@ se more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left behind , what he woke up , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was well known to test the resili@@ ence of his Dar@@ ms , travelled through the world and had an amazing as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to sink of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health affects and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sle@@ e@@ water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his call .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its test coating showed a l@@ umin@@ om@@ eters of over 4000 units .
compared to this the lam@@ umin@@ om@@ eters is fresh @-@ fired hands less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused , after their lam@@ bs over 4000 units was , while freshly curved hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &quot; &quot; Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing bad thing than that !
&quot; I will not show anything here , because it is in@@ doors here . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company desig@@ nat@@ es Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says , &quot; We really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probiot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by doing so that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian calling . &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of the gut and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala that led the direction of the film added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have made some of the things I have made him to le@@ ak , just like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things when it was easier to bring Ian to bringing it up and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we have recorded some of these dirty goodies . &quot;
&quot; in any survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents in the year 2015 associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products , which include mass@@ acres re@@ bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver &apos;s social life in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ cide family left its social apartment after del@@ aying , with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they were terror@@ ising their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were rolled out from their estate , shocking enco@@ ded employees found the property in a mis@@ par@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls of cl@@ assy holes on , wood di@@ ties have been demol@@ ished , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been restruc@@ tured and it is thought that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment no longer has been repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that had added the family to intimi@@ date the family , intimi@@ dation of people , drug abuse , drugs , and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was placed on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
in some rooms of the house that will be demol@@ ished under circumstances the old trash was found
&quot; they were tra@@ ded in the property , in which in the past drugs were tra@@ ded , the wood di@@ ties were raised . &quot;
neighbours said that she saw her on the street and had to be called the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes them and their partner this week rolled by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
the dolphins have been che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors that said that her life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They sh@@ aded by anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we are saying the police here are incredible .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not usual !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been assigned to the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the over@@ ly @-@ left side of the joint house of garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant fo@@ amed all responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ usion always is the last step to take into consideration the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behavior had been extremely difficult to watch for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the municipality who have been courageous to us and have given us the information to have done . &quot;
I hope that this development is giving some neighbors comfort and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were living at different times in the house but that they were all about 20 .
a dirty mattress that put in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ e@@ ering on the ground
workers of the household management are now to garbage to garbage cans that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid on the house and found via 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ants and cash in height of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a money after her ple@@ aded guilty of the owner of a class B in Handels@@ ab@@ err@@ ation .
she claimed that money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was he who came to life in 2013 when a car accident .
&quot; after being without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will appoint tenants which will not stick to the house@@ keeping
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , told that it was a clear warning to the other tenants which do not stick to the house@@ order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they were able to behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those affected by such behaviour . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; Sun@@ an@@ be@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of her life &quot;

this was the moment in which frightened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ ected jet cras@@ hes over a full beach .
dramatic video records showed how the military plane was almost near to sun@@ k on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the holiday@@ makers on account , when they were understand@@ ably started to make concerns about the noise of D@@ üs@@ ent@@ wear , without seeing what happened through clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers to post@@ p@@ one the dramatic Fly By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would collapse . &quot;
&quot; N@@ uno arrogan@@ ce added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep flew away
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep had to fly that this is the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the speaker said that the Jet told slightly lower than usual in the area , however , ins@@ isted the air forces that the security at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; surface fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese celebration , in which four people came to death in the island Madeira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions - strong fog and br@@ aces , so much had to fly , which restric@@ ts its point of view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boats had to be identified as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans step down in the du@@ el to the Spanish Super@@ cup , against the FC Sevilla , the set@@ game rises three days later at the Camp No@@ u . &quot;
the dou@@ ble@@ winner needs to eat in the har@@ dy C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe &apos;s league among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar who will refer to the olymp@@ ic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre @-@ Andre @-@ Andre gen is also missing .
&quot; the German lap@@ ses in the training of a changing dust in the knee , with what the disposable demand at Bar@@ ca at least is clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen &apos;s Ste@@ el@@ ands in Barcelona have been around the status as number one for two years .
&quot; Coach Luis Enri@@ que said so far to a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , for this but T@@ er Ste@@ gen is in most of the other applications . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is a doubt about the fitness state of the crew , who on Saturday in a test play of Liverpool with 0 : 4 is humili@@ ated . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the rehearsal room against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. are not yet really convincing .
&quot; Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat for an extension in the European Super@@ cup against real Madrid , and strives for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is now 11 successful by the record &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; in this application . &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis @-@ Olympics .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated its Land@@ mark on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a single @-@ sided Final with Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.@@ 4 ) .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ xed Mi@@ xed .
the two Chinese have managed to get into the final play and made the title among each other .
thus it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would get a single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches in itself . &quot;
they had withdrawn on the Tri@@ bun@@ es and left their pi@@ ge@@ ons in fair competition alone on each other .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finals I play for me , &quot; &quot; had Z@@ hang fol@@ ly said . &quot;
after the scores of gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ ant .
Ma was really struggling with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the record and left to Z@@ hang on there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superiority of Ma was not developed by the superiority of Ma .
&quot; however , nevertheless , enough breath @-@ change were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ xed Mi@@ xed was winning the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .

Donald Tr@@ ump spati@@ ally ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in the traditional conservative states of their majority . &quot;
presidential sk@@ ate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the normally large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ li@@ on@@ bear something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals from the race , now the doubt grow on his success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took again his known media outlets . &quot;
Republi@@ can High @-@ bur@@ ying
Utah is normally a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA out of June , Tr@@ ump and his acqu@@ ires from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equal . &quot;
&quot; other institutes do see Tr@@ ump , but not by the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC answered tr@@ ump to the question , how he wanted to stop the advance back to the Clin@@ ton again : &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him in the end for the sake of political correctness , whether in order , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press reporting , the party will have threatened dro@@ pping funds for the support of his election , it should not be able to present better change levels . &quot;
&quot; instead of whose plans , the candidates of Re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress are stronger under arms . &quot;
Olympia : Dre@@ ister scam at D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission to the case .
&quot; Kenya &apos;s Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ sters threatened after the second D@@ oping @-@ affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
after a brief check @-@ in in the Olympic village Kenya has sent a coach to the home of Kenya .
&quot; the International Olympic Committee shared with , as soon as a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ Commission set up , in order to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ally told that the former Spr@@ inter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a urine @-@ rehearsal under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I have issued . &quot;
this was reported by the Team@@ guide K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the event in order to include its own investigations , distributed a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , it was called a IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has been printed as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample given and signed &quot; , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of the athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I was 2015 in Beijing World Cup over 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan funeral Michael Rot@@ me had been removed from the Rio @-@ Games .
he is to be informed against money @-@ payments of his country over offensive testing .
&quot; according to media reports , he should have been arrested on his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C by the IO@@ C for several periods of time .
&quot; during the announcement of the IO@@ C issued by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 D@@ oping @-@ target controls before the Rio @-@ Games has been pointed out , that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functional control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks prior to Olympia start .
&quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing compliant with the rules of the W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a number of TV reports the ARD has been raised again and again that in Kenya dop@@ ing means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the sports race .
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had placed it in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; this could be proven that in this sport area and systematically , it was systematically established . &quot;
Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ le@@ es were then excluded from the summer .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; the Shakespeare @-@ Year presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musical captured Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
in orchestr@@ al the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ dered Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins Music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older @-@ born Mary in this staging .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y to her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also naive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor to work with her .
it is an enormous man @-@ minded person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is at all very important ! &quot;
for the American director Philip World . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have gone to the refugees , at that time the pup@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
they are the same issues and they are as much more meaningful as then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London Schul@@ m@@ maid , who joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria . &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA , one of three British school@@ mates who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly , reports in Syria . &quot;

S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died after her family after her family to leave the war @-@ exploited country and return to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that are related to the risks involved in a war area - to prevent people ever to make this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA and two other school@@ mates from the East London rose to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married a ISIS @-@ fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton is nominated for the Supreme Court for the Supreme Court . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans in the Senate have blocked confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .

Turkey : Kurdish Community expects mass @-@ cur@@ ators
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says the li@@ aison of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
the Kurdish community Germany counts in short term with ten thousands of protection seeking from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; &quot; believe the association &apos;s leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh demonstration of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup , the Kurdish community Germany expects mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with ten thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime fighting the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the governor Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had passed short @-@ strongh@@ olds with Stra@@ fac@@ tions in months , they are 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the put@@ sch put@@ sch were still se@@ cular and op@@ opposition ethnic Turks .
many will start anew in Europe if they are further sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it may not be that a state , who is taking up refugees in the own country , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ ous cities . &quot;
&quot; with that Erdo@@ gan , raising the out@@ ward ru@@ ck to the remaining Kurds increase . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , Christian @-@ Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also called CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot;
&quot; the association called for the federal government to be &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
even in Germany a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
for the first time I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the flight of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the Brand@@ mark@@ ers as Gü@@ len @-@ followers destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks asked the biggest group of the asylum eligible for asylum in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as a result of day 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus barely 29 percent of all have been entitled to be accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , do not find the war , poverty or fu@@ tiv@@ eless@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by the state side , individually per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go , where it hur@@ ts &quot;
&quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign , and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westphalia may not vote the day of the day . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the day @-@ day choice will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sword Parliament already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for da@@ wning as far as so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land days . &quot;
the locals to be convinced by the constitu@@ ents are on vacation .
&quot; most of the tourists who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not indigenous , so are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; these practical problems occur : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters up , air balloon infl@@ ating , fl@@ yers , and at the end of the voices are only lab@@ eling . &quot;
&quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again gone over by the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting how strong no@@ un@@ ing Af@@ D inter@@ cuts and what remains at the end of the end .
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Leader , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his grandfather . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it also did his legendary wor@@ e predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise Gu@@ ering has got a sea @-@ old feet and gives the chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame for the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D .
&quot; their refugee policy , ye &quot; We create this &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which probably will cost him out the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the Minister of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you &apos;re at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she invited twice chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel in the north @-@ direction ; Merkel Parliam@@ entary Group is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more Nor@@ dr@@ h@@ ein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a shame to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CD@@ U leaves largely on the usual constitu@@ tions on market locations and shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so does Kok@@ ert , play only one &quot; minor role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the union has noted that you have the base away on the land , that they must be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Greens , in the wilderness of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U Elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert to his co @-@ fighters , however , is also self @-@ prop@@ elled : &quot; you need to go where there is a way to go where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is much at stake , cel@@ ing his SPD now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
in the election of 2011 the SPD had become clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should create the leap in the day of land . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need , and put their electoral campaigns in the internet . &quot;
&quot; online @-@ election &quot; , &quot; it is called the Landes@@ leader Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green election warri@@ ors on trace search for native stimul@@ ators among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the leading can@@ did@@ ine , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it also beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : private facilities are suffering from blocking
&quot; on the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ ated , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for those who begin who begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end up against 8 o &apos;clock , there are still praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no endor@@ sement .
&quot; the job@@ site could be ready at the time @-@ end of the half @-@ time planning to the south , until the end of October everything should be done . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ obj@@ ections will also be praised for the construction work , such as if it comes to setting up comfort trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was pushed back on Monday to the south and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been restored , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 back on both sides .
the ou@@ tre@@ ach traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the responsible management of the rehabilitation responsible for the rehabilitation manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Wag@@ on road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , port street and past@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many slo@@ gans were sought and rather their Nav@@ i familiar with the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that man@@ cher truck in residential areas is French .
&quot; as the speed restrictions are not respected , the community urged to increase the measurement of measurement from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exagger@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made himself location over the situation . &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the pace with 77 hundred kilometres in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has continued , it was more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , now the street is open again . &quot;
business@@ men do not have to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 re@@ pro@@ ach has led to them for sales revenue , each one that is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are affected . &quot;
&quot; he who has no less to do with the end customer , so for other companies , for whom there is hardly any consequences for re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z is talking about a &quot; &quot; most light decline &quot; , &quot; but also a that of course , is lacking &quot; the drives . &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the hosts have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; it was missing the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; sales at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Stre@@ et@@ aker have thrown its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot;
half of his employees have to release .
&quot; if I had had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dis@@ missed , politics would have reacted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt referred to a request of G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference , the restaurant benef@@ itted otherwise from the advantages of location at the B 27 Now they also have the disadvantages , which carry out through the re@@ result . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land @-@ circles where so much is dealt with .
&quot; with all K@@ ats , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that its restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; finally , family @-@ operation since 17@@ 15 is located here , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less common , due to complicated transport , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t go down , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; that his tribal climate after the end of the san@@ itation comes back , it has no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 building to his customer &apos;s impact on the greatest crisis which has experienced its guest house in its long history . &quot;
six months of construction work has been brutal .
&quot; in the name of the terrorist attack , on the behalf of the terrorist attack . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ance status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ enable partners say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are to be the &quot; &quot; coalition partner &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
you do not require anyone .
&quot; others , further points would first discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also have participation in doing so .
&quot; but as an internal Minister he was located at results and on a &quot; &quot; conc@@ ise consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , he has sent a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced that a new safety authority is to take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany has to put several EU guidelines on passenger data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities just does not come surprising .
&quot; partly to the part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was a second call for proposals that have not been doing so far with the SPD : he wants sympathy for terrorist groups , and jihadists with double citizenship the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still hold this for reasonable and demanding nothing , what we have no chance at the co @-@ ali@@ tion@@ ists . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partially in themselves : he plans to move forward @-@ de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities for detention of people before deportation .
refugees who will be targeted into the country before their smartphones are to check @-@ in and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
&quot; for temporary asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse still worse than so far - such that the crimes commit or their papers are aware of their identity to face their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legally hom@@ ey .
man@@ ches also works un@@ parall@@ eled and leaves questions open .
and at some points - with the un@@ equal treatment of thought @-@ out for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be put into account that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees .
many people in the face of the high refugee are worried about security .
&quot; and things that are deeply occupied , were now not cl@@ amped in electoral times . &quot;
the inner safety has been enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
and yes there are electoral campaigns .
union and SPD are therefore increasingly becoming a position on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; first a gar@@ ment dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the res@@ ellers also calls a Bur@@ ka ban and a retreat from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère ti@@ ts even here to conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a departure of the double pass , he gets nothing . &quot;
we saw the discussion in Germany .
re@@ plen@@ ish that is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , has only to be shown . &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD is still trying to act on the subject of inner security .
&quot; party Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled only a careful talk to talk and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
even Volkswagen &apos;s lim@@ b comes across .
&quot; despite diesel technology , the pay@@ load is growing worldwide . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not run in all markets around . &quot;
in retrosp@@ ect there is a concept for a term .
Volkswagen starts in the second half @-@ year period .
&quot; in the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest motorway can be seen in the previous year despite the diesel technology thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ going markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW mainly in Western Europe , and with it the total sale , as that is listed in D@@ ax listed companies . &quot;
&quot; global brand VW in July , with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market , Germany pen@@ ises the deliveries to nearly a Six@@ th . &quot;
br@@ anding Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; moreover , in some core markets , it has been given a purchase process in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; besides the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ited from the EU in Turkey , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ tor initially escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
large steel for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the mainly affected house level of Nieder@@ sachsen is still further from the diesel scandal through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , there is only an exit minus of 0.@@ 9 per cent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
consolidated Fred Kap@@ pler managed from January to July further a sales spl@@ us .
&quot; 1,3 per cent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this period , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW around 2.5 million cars calls for re@@ armament to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of re@@ armament , VW , that the renovation of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ armament of vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the motorway place the customer after the re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate from a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in a company trip . &quot;
reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for continuous diesel models . &quot;
this had confirmed the past Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
the road Ministry was confirmed that this meeting was present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfill the requirements of my investig@@ ational Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this will not be accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the re@@ armament do not take place and all the typ@@ ho@@ bic vehicle levels have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not as it was in a business trip . &quot;
&quot; on the wide term &apos; warranty &apos; , Volkswagen the possibility that customers should come for example a half year after retro@@ fitting around a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage is nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also , even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage which has nothing to do with the absur@@ dity , with regard to possible warran@@ ties , as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW don &apos;t use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is required by rich austerity in the future of criminal off@@ ences - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; President Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers , which park 40 million euros on tox@@ ins or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German association German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : normal Spar@@ er must not fear , to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; deposit banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.@@ 4 per cent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private - and corporate clients , for deposits over 100,000 Euro to po@@ ro@@ - or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost 400 Euros in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he had been blown away for 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not dec@@ eler@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and will cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; the banker said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put up for any million 4000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; after all , he will give the cost to the pays principle . &quot;
&quot; the cash just lie in the saf@@ ari of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve experienced four exagger@@ ations , I don &apos;t even have the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the bank stood . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and are rarely on other assets .
only a few wander@@ ing to other banks .
the cooperative association of Bavaria explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , whether &quot; &quot; business @-@ economically permanently is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or instructions . &quot;
&quot; with criminal off@@ ences for deposits over three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger made the country with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , the main shareholder of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect to pay for private clients up to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is far from banks and savings banks too strong . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see give it a cliff , which is equipped from the property . &quot;
this can become a problem for a small bank if they hat@@ ched for free money .
&quot; the 1911 @-@ based cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ likes , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; currently , the cooperative association Bavaria is currently not known for any further banks that charge a replacement for in@@ soles of individuals , &quot; said Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; the threshold , to neg@@ atives to go against the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is tough , and it is dro@@ pping the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany are not fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does actually buy sound @-@ plates ?
lonely men of middle ages love plates .
&quot; before calling for the comment to over@@ saw it , in order to over@@ saw it under the alias of non @-@ aging old men &apos;s disease , this statement leads from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most pronounced re@@ development of sound plates not to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des through hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older plate cle@@ ars keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I lie in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , just before I ste@@ ward off my hands and say something certain as : &quot; &quot; so , let us look at a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos slowly takes place at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of special record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera , asking the camera off for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight young men , a woman probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound@@ ing records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by him at home ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records which he did not afford to buy and again buy items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 1960s , early 70@@ ies who appeared out when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records , are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who will have heard about the com@@ eback , and caused to see their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been removed so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who sold their plates sold to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to get back their plates again , he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the record @-@ change of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of trusted gram@@ pl@@ atten@@ ds , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a plate pile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people purchased last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % own a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
at this time of the news report I would probably be very worried while being pet@@ ri@@ fied by a pile of wick@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy of the Revi@@ vals &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; someone recently arrived here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely going to happen . &quot;
&quot; more produced , less musi@@ cally @-@ cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; we have people , who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only come slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ stop , which has devoted the sound plates almost a whole floor has a b@@ ump public , when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos , teen@@ ager and women middle aged . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz cycles out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them sees sometimes lonely , but na@@ ating mental trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be determined if one stands next to someone 30 seconds in addition . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variation of the plates for sale . &quot;
it is rather a window @-@ inherited than a major purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of plates ... it is driving with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a store , which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban out@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I would like to give the An@@ ans hotel to mu@@ stern , I watch a group of young teen@@ ager , which group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think of buying a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; to the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my descendants have taken the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors &quot; s and record female women who exist in reality , record business and in Online@@ for@@ en . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; you will not spend their Thursday tomorrow with the B@@ um@@ ble through records from Ber@@ wick Street and the leaf by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year old moder@@ ator , which rises over the shoulders nothing ah@@ nen@@ ess of the men of middle @-@ aged . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week , the government should argue that the state should export , 72 pro@@ vision@@ ing shops to sell , hair@@ dressing services offer or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture , argued that these places should be crus@@ hed because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ ans have to adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tempor@@ aries of the especially effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic real En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to sandy bridges with temporary arm@@ chair , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit can be observed there . &quot;
&quot; however , a continuous mobil@@ er can however be too dangerous or consuming . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps on uninterrupted measurement operation five days , the case data is transferred via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple marks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limit as well as transit files after time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ driving condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with tags . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply folded , he is lowered by mess@@ aging , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and incidentally , also sh@@ out safe out@@ si@@ eve disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the leaves from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; also foreign authorities with the new technique : rejuven@@ ated France has prevented France 100 pieces as a Georgian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain fet@@ ched silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold wins
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by arrived on Thursday evening to a rup@@ tly stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten up here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
&quot; Fi@@ ji inv@@ aded a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , rep@@ ay , line @-@ run , and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic wa@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was ens@@ hr@@ ined by the not too bad Tro@@ st@@ preis of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they were really proud of their efforts at this tournament in which they were New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
but regardless of that Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a Br@@ ite morning will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind itself .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this work@@ book will we@@ ave , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderfully and let the attacks GB@@ s out of fun abor@@ tion .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
&quot; with even four minutes of season , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right corner which he um@@ bled . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a dre@@ amy t@@ aming of Mitchell stopped the mountain of husband Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch @-@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u black@@ out by further weak T@@ ackl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while the UK is still available . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to half @-@ time through and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for four minutes , what was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favour of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans s@@ angen , flags and danced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff , the Fi@@ j@@ is um@@ arm@@ oured and GB ki@@ cked out in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain urged South Africa in a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - British transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot work and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kled of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fighting with the cancer of the trainer for ru@@ si@@ pe inspired
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than in these games and that is what kind of hot .
&quot; from the first rowing back to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she ru@@ ined for the second Olympics in a row that was first women in the history of British sport that put such a scale . &quot;
&quot; its dominance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ loaded use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athle@@ te who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the nature of the tri@@ mming . &quot;
behind every gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ ful hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no one of the most not@@ ep@@ tive than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said that he risky .
&quot; I had brass cancer , the oper@@ able and that did they do . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads throughout . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment early 2014 , outside the season , what the interruption was to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so it had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ min@@ ability of the victory , their first thought of Williams came to talk a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much that means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would not be any one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could have no better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have stopped , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver were too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very much in the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it really is important to not get caught up .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking out to make something Tol@@ les .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have put a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London , it took some six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years intended for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of some time in the original one in a contribution by the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken defended the two @-@ association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ s @-@ group &quot; &quot; Bav@@ ern@@ far as exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the two @-@ association office , was 28 years as managing director . &quot;

&quot; its tasks have been very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and initiation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the acquisition of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the new fountain ( in 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the bat@@ ches of water lines . &quot;
there have been no dead@@ lock and you have added new innovations because water lives be@@ de@@ ing and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised i@@ dol , reliable , and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart bloo@@ di@@ t for its water purpose , and he has lived the water @-@ purpose governing the water system , as if it were his own company . &quot;
a few weeks ago he was allowed to present the V@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rate group in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received very much appreciation and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ one praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best waterfalls and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as highlights from his point of view he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re @-@ struc@@ turing of the two @-@ dimensional association .
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use of the tube at the col@@ der near a 3rd of January . &quot;
here at minus 17 degrees the whole night has been working so that the villages with water could be supplied with water .
&quot; also , the supply of Neu@@ brunn is only to be maintained , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt , filled with h@@ oses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who follow the follow @-@ up of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the kr@@ isen@@ beut@@ led and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains at extra cost in million@@ aires .
financial bur@@ dens that threaten the industry from the oil @-@ driven promotion are from the table .
&quot; it abi@@ des in the liberation of renewable energy supply in the components for so @-@ called self @-@ energy production in the German steel industry , Federal Ministry of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the West German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we were able to finally reach the tough negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned , initially planned , the steel producer , the gases from the Ho@@ ho@@ fen to generate electricity for its own consumption , to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; the steel industry , according to the German industry , added additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certificate from the EU Commission to talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators will be replaced in the steel works , an EEG system of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission to self @-@ flow .
the status quo of the current regulation will be largely fixed .
special meaning have the successful effort from Gabriel to the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the first step . &quot;
&quot; further need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the reform of the emissions law system climate and employment targets are considering &quot; &quot; IG Metall boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a substantial price pressure from the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year further exac@@ erb@@ ated the situation than the world &apos;s largest black@@ out China threw in light on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel roll@@ ments .
in the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
&quot; to a show for a show on import steel effect , on the other hand the economic prospects of China have turned up . &quot;
unclear how sustainable the price re@@ conditioning is unclear .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained cautious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry reacted to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p did not want to exclude in the last also closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; it produced with 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the economic association steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the multitude went back to the second month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the production is reduced by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in order . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing good luck &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she defeated music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old she sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a sample , it feels balanced , cheerful and total life , says it . &quot;
she does something good at her with her health and her mind .
&quot; for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German seniors . &quot;
&quot; most of the seniors singing in the choir , and sharing with like @-@ minded joy in the music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular inter@@ connection , seniors can build and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because they often solve social and familiar structures at the age , a choir then is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : to speak and organize themselves to the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
because exercising seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever asks his lungs regularly , even in everyday life is not so fast from the d@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even though it is about obtaining the sound of voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz is said by the federal work of the elderly organizations . &quot;
&quot; during the older generations the common S@@ ingen had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; l@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs with older people w@@ ro@@ ught many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; by Li@@ ed@@ ly@@ te and especially melodies , people themselves deny themselves &quot; denied people &quot; for a long time . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head is also required for a special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on yourself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is growing by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : if I am long for something , I will better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he likes to have little talent , tra@@ ys L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; yes not only - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who stops , when a sound is next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone sings out of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a seniors , you can easily connect . &quot;
many towns also offer views of choirs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic chor@@ us , can contact the church or the Church . &quot;
many senior choirs can be found via the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the inter@@ ne@@ f@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; who would like to sing , should be connected to a choir , let H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul is doing good and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for each age .
cats react sensitive as cr@@ ater on cri@@ es of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover which effect the herds of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the building had not been cold even the males not cold - but they always kept themselves the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal of cat bab@@ ys at the bro@@ ws of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to foli@@ age of kittens , which are in great need , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater also react to the herds of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the building of less and strongly imp@@ acted young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already figured out that the duration and sound height of the kittens would be different with the urgency of their help . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult k@@ aters and eight kis@@ ses were observed from the animal management of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; you have been playing for a Ru@@ fe of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the root box and separated from mother and si@@ blings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens , which were additionally elevated . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for so@@ wing power@@ fully .
&quot; all females , even those who have not had their own offspring , reacted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker when this Ru@@ fe has played the very rainy kit@@ ties .
this ability may be linked or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have at all reacted , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined several times in people experiencing the reactions of women and men to baby noises . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women are more sensitive on infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes place with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ mu@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the one @-@ old football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ mu@@ r an arrest warrant has been en@@ acted .
he was accused to be a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , a key football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ eling of Arch@@ at@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as is said .
&quot; even in the suspension of the exceptional situation after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ hes should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
there will be no content before the football one .
against the earlier Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
&quot; according to this , a member of a terrorist group is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ch@@ r should be followers of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who , from the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , for the coup attempt to be held responsible . &quot;
&quot; although the first for 90 days is still considered an emergency state , nor until October , it actually did not affect the life of most Turks but as good as any effects . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ orph@@ ans &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdo@@ gan was declared on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole land - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; particularly fans of the worker @-@ club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the president . &quot;
&quot; but considering the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experience in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart is proposed for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; it will be taken to arrive again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
its sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the cont@@ ests of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as a Top@@ ic of his association .
in the end game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he generated the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent manner and backed up his team the podium .
&quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; the dis@@ missed season for the record masters was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; also plays out in the Europa League early . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to gain something .
&quot; that we have managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master visits the game was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who covered with 26 seasonal de@@ posit@@ ors as Southern @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ gen , the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return on the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; on the occasion of the AC @-@ Florence under contract and the first @-@ time Gom@@ ez , after the coup , did not come back to the coup because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped the &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; club chief Fi@@ ghting Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; for this , the falls would have to be ready to ren@@ oun@@ ce around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros of vin@@ tages , which makes it clear : &quot; its salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tik @-@ sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio around medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is determined according to the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping @-@ lock her starting @-@ right before the games , was p@@ inn@@ ed at its start ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ it@@ less p@@ fe@@ ti@@ ghten and bu@@ ck@@ led . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scene : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and was prov@@ oked with her performance .
&quot; as a firm , she won &apos;t get gold , the audience got out of a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm . &quot;
but there are many more athletes who go to the start despite D@@ oping past during the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest comb@@ ative of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic @-@ season and si@@ eben@@ fold world had to sit in 2010 a six month lock after it was detected the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had strong tooth pain , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championships was tested in 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic bes@@ ought the bl@@ ur@@ ly intake and was locked six months .
the four most common lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ride ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Games and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months locked . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , praying Mer@@ tre@@ k . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m from the fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes , have been detected so many medals . &quot;
so lost Ti@@ ch@@ on his World Cup titles from 2005 nine years later after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 for testosterone abuse .
&quot; the also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he was taken back on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court . &quot;
&quot; with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , it lies on the rank two of the world tran@@ sit@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world heritage and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old world championship in terms of taking a negotiated dietary supplement , the sper@@ re of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell m@@ ite , and ran on July 13th . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Days in breach - Sever@@ al T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand standing with the woman in Thailand , told the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered ker@@ f@@ aded and had been treated in the hospital , but this time has already been left again . &quot;
she planned her home for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ de , also an Austrian national citizen , is not yet unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department stand in close contact with local authorities , so schn@@ apps . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Thailand change in death and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Lower countries and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday early then went two explo@@ sives , according to the authorities another person was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb attack .
&quot; in the detection near of the holidays , popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong was injured by the police statements . &quot;
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country then another bomb that was fatal .
&quot; according to the authorities in one flower , the spr@@ int was gone into the air before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police in the air . &quot;
finally de@@ on@@ ations were demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ ar on the southeast coast several injured .
&quot; if one go out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bombar@@ d@@ att@@ att@@ ate wear the same manuscript , &quot; said Army @-@ General Dan@@ ai said Ms meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ av@@ ee &apos;s Friday early before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to speak to possible motives - probably , however , it is a question of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognize a sample that is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of a local separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police on the other hand explained the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of oppos@@ ers of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; over the past few days , authorities have been given secrecy about im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still , what group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police pointed out its officials throughout the country to increase security around important governmental buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bombs of bombs , but they usually do not focus against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in lies a palace that was used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the Ministry of Bom@@ ben@@ explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommended on its homepage , to contribute to the instructions of the Thai Security authorities . &quot;
&quot; for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ola and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security and Muslim populations , not necessary travel to these provinces is eliminated . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday lasted a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
the military influence the military influence also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bombs were a attempt to stand chaos , while the country towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest , keeps itself good , the kingdom has returned to stability and order again . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on to the military in the far south of the country in the far south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok the event had been killed in a show on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is to be taken into account of the Federal Constitutional Court for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several countries , the constitu@@ ents in the covenant have taken the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; for aspirations against the liber@@ ating democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said constitutional Chairman Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , im@@ migrant Islamic faith or the Middle East will diff@@ usion the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we observe the movement now . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; constitutional Con@@ duc@@ tors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority is closely coordinated with the state offices .
&quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally trying extremis@@ ts to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremism . &quot;
this is not any kind of publicity for your own cause .
the propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are very suscep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , it had given reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; for Af@@ D @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; to constitutional protection , the possible contacts of this kind will only be relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist , changes its target and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; so , whether such individuals have controlled influence over the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in extreme crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this connection not yet from new right terrorism . &quot;
but in recent years we have noticed that there can be right @-@ going structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Group .
&quot; it can be quite noticeable that further justi@@ fiable groups or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremism . &quot;
&quot; however , a clear or Europe @-@ wide control of justification but not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate concerned themselves that many persu@@ asions went to the account of people who had not stepped into the right scene before . &quot;
this is worrying .
&quot; many of the fact susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum @-@ revenues were not known as criminals , politically motivated criminal law or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people therefore have committed crimes that were perhaps right with right wing , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left which , however , were radic@@ alised through far @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it

this shows the courageous appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center schw@@ amm of the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers made from Ethiopia , so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the excerpt was chosen .
in social networks Hab@@ it became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and scored the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just sports figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is taking part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special citizen from the international swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ merged countries better .
&quot; since in Ethiopia , most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te just wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; fast , the first nickname made the lap . &quot;
some media signed it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in relation to a &quot; &quot; wellbeing &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no role . &quot;
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically became M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
at that time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ ed building increased in Schmidt with it that all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities with a very low waste water handle , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis , for instance , it would affect a necessary repairs of several thousand Euro . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ e@@ water in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to its age of age and repar@@ ation period , were not least due to their age of age and repar@@ ation expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for World Championships , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt ins@@ isted that in the wast@@ e@@ water system Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged due to any damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk World Heritage Site , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be outdated to nearly 20 years of operation and an additional aer@@ ob@@ um possibility to be able to keep in line with the water legal specifications in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; to this extraordinary expenditure , the advanced expenses have been advanced and maintenance costs , which are accordingly to be taken into account in the new cal@@ am@@ ation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which can still be significantly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; Stein@@ häuser made clear that at low waste water in the three installations , the expenses for the operation and sub@@ content . &quot;
&quot; in this case , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the wast@@ e@@ water investments in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious according to stone houses , especially since one would not be able to expand the supply area of the water @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these systems , because it is concerned about de@@ deficit institutions . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 was per cent on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.@@ 2 % .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 , 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.1 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation of July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods are observed : food and non alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine conditions ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as asi@@ an caricature critic@@ ises
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter Ani@@ me is inspired but some observers say it is uns@@ ensi@@ tive towards races .
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users who change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , stand@@ ardis@@ ed tools that generate more than 30 million aids per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps arrive to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have moved in the past criticism in which they have been accused that the app Black@@ face bla@@ ze or white skin would lead to beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week some utensils hit a filter that gave them a filter , false teeth and re@@ ared che@@ eks , some critics had a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ atic - &quot; yellow @-@ sighted . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebellion were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not as caricature of Asian .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , the rac@@ is@@ m@@ atism have experienced , reminded the filter of hur@@ ting cl@@ is@@ che@@ es . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ we@@ et has been widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and to be said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter @-@ creation of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not b@@ umpy , but that the yel@@ lowing was drawn into the ab@@ err@@ ation extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural team .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats a big audience of young people - who are in the race di@@ ens@@ er than their older counterparts - could rather be expected to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters is created that such matters remain un@@ noticed , as it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u , who works as a product man@@ ag@@ erin and engineer for medium to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , for others to do the same . &quot;
she said in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that predat@@ or @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the her@@ edi@@ ction practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the great part white only male &apos;s leadership and ended their appearance with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; the Chinese Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but they are not in positions where they are safe or feeling good to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a speaker the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible for under@@ lining population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
&quot; military intelligence information on ISIS , displays the Committee of Congress &quot;
military Command changed the United States Central Command to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual states on site as it announced the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Republi@@ que , secret service representative and the Wehr@@ macht , reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analyses , which reported how pre@@ set their estim@@ ations to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news service information , which were typically decreased by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , periodic@@ ally reported a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism and were all positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering , when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can@@ ese member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management error in Cent@@ Com are up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report gives detailed profound problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence to change that government tips on Obama statements submitted , it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from its predec@@ essors , also known as analysts or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known publicly that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the following recording reports to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them was played that analysts are concerned with the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation is continued .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports have been underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the news service sector , published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com has provided an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of commen@@ cement services on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; provided the &quot; &quot; stran@@ gely &quot; &quot; commander in the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; delayed the publication of following reports reports , &quot; rep@@ lic@@ ated the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave over@@ ly little room for so@@ fter views . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no references to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts , with regard to a certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported from investigations by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which have been received after complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man on the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence had no reports of Congress while the investigations of the general spec@@ tor would be still going on . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have absolutely diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Defense Department would welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have taken effect on the issue of a successful air@@ campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have rejected the question of how far President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ orable military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret formations over the Islamic state remind of constraints of more than ten years , as the then government under George W. Bush saw against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation in Iraq , and have little time on it , to reflect on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate government attacks against the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ vision@@ ing refin@@ eries had been put into operation since these pro@@ vision@@ ing refin@@ eries had to sell in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times was reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of the women having a show@@ down with Great Britain
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also shot the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India , that the American players had won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever did . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , they know , however , : American competitions are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition , and are in their group with the Brit@@ inside on the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet again on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which of both within their group of six teams each will gain the first and second place . &quot;
the first place will leave the strong hol@@ dings a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; like always the game going on Saturday , the American sisters triggered a surprising vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ al by their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 places on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she played a ho@@ ckey girl in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the ca@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an English , Trainer of the National Team , began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we have the rest of the completely around .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
&quot; India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter to put the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; you completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ ke , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate around the American men to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the Tor@@ ture of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that had previously missed a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
&quot; wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and in@@ escap@@ ably , a rapid season between competition and pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a fl@@ atter , stretching from wr@@ aps to the Tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you cannot turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ app@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is at the Olympic Games for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with congratulations , would have been able to have been sent to Prime Time , built through sponsors and feel free advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fe@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not commonly recognized : air gun shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest and may it have long reign .
&quot; but when I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then leave me the attention of the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , it was the last 16 years that many , I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA was sent to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athle@@ te until 2012 , who made it up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women &apos;s women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more suitable for a Clo@@ wn@@ s@@ school more suitable for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only one er@@ ased enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never @-@ going clouds - but also the Grazie of gym and diving , the two sports that unites it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( spin , yeast and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; they will be evaluated according to the official Olympics in terms of execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic V@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists have to continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes until the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they chase not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transfer also another height of height : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pose@@ ful quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator with tears . &quot;
&quot; but it is also what I myself , when looking at these games , can be ti@@ ring . &quot;
the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
moving forward is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ un@@ t off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessness as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the destination , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine the ends as part of a afternoon @-@ block from 2 days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie promise they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness gains can be achieved only through the anxiety and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long a fo@@ e of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators to demand the political changes in Ethiopia on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in sc@@ uss@@ sion .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last few months , protests against the government and the country had become more and more areas . &quot;
last week rus@@ hed thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses gave witnesses that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot on land of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in the run @-@ run videos on the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year , how security people show young people with st@@ aves , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is more than Nigeria the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; the American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ian to fight terrorist attacks across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy was expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ul@@ ler@@ ene in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly over@@ threw the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents have been sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or in the desert of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the spice grip in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a further critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle to these jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liberation front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ des , which in recent years have been forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and could armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of em@@ bit@@ ation after years of the we@@ ather@@ ing has now explo@@ ded under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as more smart phones have always been more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in Prot@@ est , does many people still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies which will hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians made that she met so as prot@@ rac@@ ted .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons of prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and business , while the Oro@@ mos are exploited , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests occurred in the areas of Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigers , which constitute around 6 percent of the population and those in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics are dominant . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as tactical genius , a man who could think about the corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly dis@@ credited in this , early signs of dissatisfaction to perceive and use special , to edit opponents and to make it un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this fundamental sense , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian of new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ careful reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr Hai@@ le@@ nav@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the control of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , that Ethiopia was experienced for such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands against elections were seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following blade , many prot@@ esters were killed , although there were less than in the past months , and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia guide for their visionary infrastructure planning , like the new pend@@ ul@@ um , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters attacked prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ischen city , by Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred against the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ym flights over the neigh@@ b@@ oured Somalia , even though she recently worked out that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to be collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ at@@ hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy who surround his campaign by taking his several repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fying clari@@ fying new questions concerning the communication skills of the re@@ public@@ ans of the re@@ public@@ ans whether he will be able to communicate clearly and communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings together his fellow @-@ wing , who strive to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the actual position , statements that he couldn &apos;t have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after having made the acceptance of an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning t@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was unlike the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of interviews said , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator , Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to weaken the statement by taking it from it , that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , he wanted to know the Republi@@ can presidential race of nothing of it . &quot;
the final storm of criticism pointed down to Mr. Tr@@ ump down while he is trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of random change values on the business situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has put sar@@ cas@@ m already in its defense .
&quot; at the end of July he made strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians should free@@ ze Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mails , but he later said &quot; &quot; Of course I said this sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a still relative note because its re@@ frac@@ tional values have gone back . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a lead with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologi@@ ze for its pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but as it stands stronger in the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze his loyal co @-@ party , to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps of most prominent people , gave themselves great effort to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was interviewed to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense it is true that Obama ISIS an almost unknown , small organisation , he called her back@@ bone , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government used under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister , ISIS allowed to spread out , spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words , and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he ha@@ iled the &quot; poor , j@@ un@@ uch , &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; they cannot ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ology as only a further proof he would be in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; once distributed over the price from the market , café is back in Green@@ point back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ big@@ es Café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , for but 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was ur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b put in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous it as the last loss in a distorted city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ von wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ ed ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and the company of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a client offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held much at . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same Esp@@ res@@ som@@ asch@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ies like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are nat@@ ories of nature .
the café serves no beer any more ; there are fresh juice .
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he has noticed a st@@ acking current of old tribal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed aside by awards from Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira there was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the way to him . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee grin@@ der , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b , which fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch@@ clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with Sp@@ eck , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t be Gro@@ ll that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the col@@ der coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go back to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has made the menu into the Polish Republic , and Rodri@@ guez said that he pre@@ fers to expose her soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site has also further advantages .
an ancient Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café has expan@@ sion@@ ed on a linear building .
there is a new ver@@ b for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tribal and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
&quot; as the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the participation of the loc@@ als and the cut@@ ters felt a new coffee like a home coming home . &quot;
&quot; I had to say that , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a gour@@ mets President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland waterfalls .
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ ato Sauce , potato p@@ um@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of food solidarity with common people , &quot; &quot; Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man talks in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when she met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ak@@ y Imb@@ iss in Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cream with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato and vegetable @-@ mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ch@@ ats ordered , this found the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a bit of fine which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ ers to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ e gr@@ ste .
&quot; it has to be laid in the stomach such as B@@ lei , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , a all @-@ you can @-@ can @-@ buffet @-@ buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ded for male Fel@@ dar@@ s and it was served fresh baked past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans which took place during the first World War food in star@@ ving European food . &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; draws the ways in which the country was surrounded by , no more the shr@@ lar@@ ry country . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense topic , &quot; explained Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary was the new bud@@ get@@ ary so@@ wn : mysterious food such as loaves and cas@@ ser@@ tations became to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ olle as &quot; &quot; wonderful nature , eating remains re@@ reliable , &quot; &quot; mer@@ cen@@ ary Zi@@ egel@@ man , as chefs un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients could hide under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry .
&quot; meat , which was for years the center of the American cuisine , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar compounds have been tried out , since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing grati@@ fication had to prevail before taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , we prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular supplement on the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , drives budget economic , including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by being published by adding recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household women &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizen , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ cake attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm@@ houses of his kitchen , spe@@ ers like the millions of men of the world , to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost g@@ il@@ ded dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was lovely real@@ ity .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute his stomach with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the an@@ alogy described in a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the dri@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is focused on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food . &quot;
the couple had been better understood during writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother in law - for example how they could not throw off food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; she did people actually sick .
there was the wind@@ case .
&quot; after the plates were ev@@ apor@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they removed and Co@@ e a dessert which they had cooked at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roo@@ sev@@ elt , ate at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes name a name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no curved Sah@@ ne , just pl@@ ums , somewhat flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone was a bit reluc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e fet@@ ched a night@@ stand for three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of jag@@ ged wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he cr@@ acked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a well @-@ bom@@ bed attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which , according to the picture @-@ newspaper so far , nearly 6@@ 0.000 people saved the life . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 volunteers expose their own life to play , to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to afford the first aid in the war @-@ area . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Society that shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a pur@@ ge from the ruins of a house went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians for shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he has never seen himself , said loud image : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I can save lives , I think that God is in me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the final bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have thrown four fac@@ ili@@ bombs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , the image cited his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea by an investigation on board the S@@ anna panel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms well with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ y only get started with 150 years .
&quot; besi@@ eged of the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to , acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal on s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and this maximum speed is half as fast as a ro@@ be . &quot;
&quot; this one of the long @-@ term lifestyle , however , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from an Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life span , which means a world @-@ ch@@ ord for spinal cord . &quot;
admittedly the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long been that Greenland of Greenland is st@@ agn@@ ant .
only missing the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ y are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ic@@ meer in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface only in winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , researchers know according to little ones . &quot;
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ emp@@ o measures it , as it exp@@ elled six animals from the Spitz@@ bergen six animals with a transm@@ itter . &quot;
&quot; loot still make this shar@@ ks , nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a ro@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young ic@@ orn . &quot;
possibly they hunt asleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ e@@ eres and are looking for car@@ c@@ asses which are from higher water layers to down .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as a con@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 inches long , while the largest 50@@ 2 inches measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lens of shar@@ ks . &quot;
this centre of eye lens has already been created before the birth of the shar@@ ks that the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
&quot; after the early 1960s , their birth should lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are scattered . &quot;
&quot; in the length of 220 centimeters in length , the third @-@ smallest animal contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ y had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens with cosmic radiation , which arises in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 , during the record @-@ Ha@@ i with 50@@ 2 centimeters , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters even 3@@ 92 years old might be . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland , Greenland only then desc@@ grew , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign the length of an age . &quot;
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters , probably on the threshold to the genital mature and his age with 156 years , Greenland is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this might be the case for vert@@ ebr@@ ates currently world @-@ ord .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; even the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck , a 120 year old har@@ po@@ kes pointed , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
due to low temperatures it is often running the organism of the animals living there on austerity .
so they are more mature later - and al@@ igning slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal can handle heat . &quot;
heat loss from one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building in the double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the com@@ der@@ at is focused on the main meeting in the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel took up the Communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the rejuven@@ ated proven residential building can begin . &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg its best opportunities to attract from London abandoned jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ iting from the Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence fel@@ ine financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money @-@ houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
so far it is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport to date in the UK .
the use of just large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ Association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; comp@@ lies with 10000 new jobs in the Main River five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities as European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , however , is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg , in Luxembourg , have a great fund , but did it as well as Dublin in the infrastructure worse . &quot;
Frankfurt was significantly easier to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city is expanding the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , M@@ alls are also spending 50 percent higher than the Main River . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt has a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company &apos;s consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is at No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 , Dublin to No.@@ 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um important financial center in Europe to mean the economic researchers .
&quot; for this also the correlation of forces : in London worked in accordance with the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives right costs from the Hepatitis C patent with Mer@@ ck
an American in@@ verter ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc claim has been entitled to a refund of the legal costs which you have created from the hep@@ atic C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

&quot; in a cr@@ ush , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false phrases and instruc@@ tors in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax entries , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man and his lawyers have seen a tax examination of the tax authorities as a reason for his denial . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons Elec@@ tions in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Presidential did@@ acy of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advisor , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not finished . &quot;
&quot; cover critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential Presidential did@@ acy of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already noted that its ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organizations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and released a video on the internet in the high priest Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump demand its tax statement .
on Thursday she talked about the topic during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
he refused to do what every other Presidential did@@ acy has done in recent decades and to publish its tax statements . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; Poli@@ tico reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times held a number of tax hav@@ ens and tax consultants , the information that may be still the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ control must become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alists is here to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their taxes . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said , he was also subjected to a tax examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ ics campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid for an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combination of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax statement of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income , compared , unlike the majority of all Americans . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ iles Berlin Hotel because Israeli re@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media record after he pointed out that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , since there &apos;s Arabic guests called for a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , where he wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find out Israel on the country &apos;s country list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after explaining , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ ok him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel presented said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , sol@@ dering in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have requested that the election is deleted , the acceptance of Lan@@ z@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant , called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were ex@@ tant and over@@ thrown by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this in Germany has carried out exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident sol@@ ves a fairly big resonance on the internet in which the people called for a scandal .
some sub@@ merged the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel that had given it to the alleged requirements of Arab guests .
&quot; ashamed you &quot; , &quot; it was referred to in a different post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; Israel did not include into the Schnell@@ list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotel . &quot;
it adds that the coun@@ tdown has now been added .
police supports Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a &amp; rubber @-@ ra@@ ils against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students gather along Thursday in the Brazilian city Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers try to cover the students , which resulted in the police of rubber bul@@ lets and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation across the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ant participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators walked in masses on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff that had been ab@@ duc@@ ted by a v@@ ot@@ um of the Senate to their deportation from the office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly desc@@ ends to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; the abolition of sanctions grew by the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade mark between Moscow and Tehran at 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in foreign companies in the country has increased greatly , the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade @-@ building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he recognised that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amoun@@ ted $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the trade down@@ turn has been reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan dates back to this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year there was the Russian foreign representatives of around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , in Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers are broken in Russia from the last year , he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that hopes to change it . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses searched : drink k@@ em@@ ar@@ kt in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a predat@@ ory falls on the drink of RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under pre @-@ yiel@@ ding a sho@@ al weapon demanded three dark cl@@ ots , who had r@@ ored their faces from the staff of the drink then first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police does not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small . &quot;
the drink of the drink is directly accessible from the parking lot of the RE@@ WE market .
&quot; the perpetrators must be ri@@ pped after the attack towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Path and from which opposite to the parking area in the lake &apos;s parking ground with the silver @-@ colored car , may be found in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who has made observations about the time ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the predat@@ ory of the predat@@ ors , should be deb@@ ated in the police . &quot;

&quot; in the quiet open @-@ line Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was included during the first school week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the program .
for a one went to Bret@@ ts with a visit to the stro@@ z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other , to J@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s leading monastery in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip was leading to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group drove much about everyday life and the food of the kis@@ ses .
&quot; on the hot days you can enjoy the group at the Tie@@ fen@@ see in Mi@@ bron@@ n , which was built for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; culinary children and car@@ et@@ akers were pampered with their self prepared body@@ suit like the acid sp@@ ar , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful jewelry pieces made of beads and stones created or made of wood a Roman mill @-@ game made . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims for the gate of the mercy
the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the sea @-@ unit E@@ Q@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages has been tac@@ kled .
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next wake @-@ up of all min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in expected two years to bridge , the Upper @-@ round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgri@@ ma@@ ges have been checked and it was finally decided in this year for the Bishop &apos;s town of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ gate , opened to the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year , which was offered a special pilgri@@ m goal during this year . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is made from peti@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ rooms arose on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman stands , and so the pilgrimage has been approached away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day trips were divided in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writers . &quot;
&quot; but on the way , the Min@@ is on dirt cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches again and again R@@ ast to sing together a song from stand@@ ardis@@ ed pilgrims Li@@ ed@@ he@@ el . &quot;
for the nights were always available for the nights of the local parish .
&quot; at the Et@@ app@@ enzi@@ ed Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty , hearty , and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day it passed over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags after the end of St. Peter , one entered the stage to St. Peter , which had the stren@@ uous path , however , had to climbed up about 500 metres in heat at first and then again . &quot;
the served reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on the beach .
after the morning impul@@ s on the fourth pilgrimage in the imposing monastery of St. Peter went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ cap to Freiburg .
&quot; clearly reli@@ eved and happy met the Min@@ is on the late afternoon in Münster , and steps up the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse here God was than@@ ked .
in the evening trade fair in Münster the Min@@ utes were greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the worship service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the Hoch@@ altar .
the next day there was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ge metropolis .
afternoon went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms at home as a Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the male team Sprint in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the an@@ ker@@ chief , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young squ@@ ad made up his legend , when he was stor@@ med home to win a victory of the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed four years ago a shocking victory while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympics .
&quot; she repeated the trick , after she in March at the rail World Championship in London despite the back of the back , Ho@@ ys were just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retired created a gap that was trying to close K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man when they stayed in when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that has now developed .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner set out over four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner finished in the qualifying round a olymp@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the standard people the New Zealand triumph@@ s in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was shortly back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy shift made a large part of the transformation , with the execution in a higher course , to slow it down and to allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; in the final , we set up a olymp@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the Triumph 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave us hints that he fell on the way after a weak start .
he later moved this statement later and there was no objection to England Riv@@ als .
this time there was no such problem at this time .
&quot; note : &quot; &quot; it feels like London with the entire GB flags on the Tri@@ bun@@ es like London . &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have been so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if that is a bar@@ ometer for our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days at Vel@@ o@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the area of the possibility that he repeatedly repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; this would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , which was also born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a explo@@ iting of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the band of the Ho@@ y immediately .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes the next in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ Event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ all@@ est competition of the day , but there was other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ ke , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
&quot; the world ch@@ ord , which won in London gold at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22 42 ) will take place today on the second day of competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus . &quot;
&quot; he had disputed yesterday with respon@@ dents before the qualification , when he called for him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ended , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world era in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team is leaving its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a flock to medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were down .
&quot; it played in the background as the resignation of the Technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the middle of Sex@@ ual and har@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees itself the first evening of competition in Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , who at the perfect moment has reached its culmin@@ ation again . &quot;
future of melting by Port@@ land due to the abolition of the energy market
&quot; the future of the aluminum system of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , because the plant operators announce the energy supply contract and thus deliver all supply agreements , such as the supplier energy industry . &quot;
&quot; this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years of current sub@@ missions runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect , could be at risk at a conclu@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domain effects as the melting of around 10 percent of the total electricity generation is consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ ing , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which serves the big aluminum system with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , told that three more owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese companies CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L will assume that the system will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting shell , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said , that the &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; contracts were supposed to come into force starting from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice so they will end 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L will assume that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
&quot; all the potential effects on the revenue at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong schedules , for wholesale prices . &quot;
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the contracts in its year @-@ down amoun@@ ted to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to cancel the Treaties , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate or to ensure the power supply to the melting . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who was supposed to have entered into effect from November this year , even though an explanation is guilty , why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic relations of the industry before possible closing of the Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ ing in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land spoke about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the pier of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ded back highly than the message with the show Jen@@ ners came out at the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding on the mis@@ conception seems to ride out at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the new issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e foli@@ age .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their free time it is to be seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; common centers , more than 16@@ 0.000 people from now on &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid of the country , more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s clear@@ est centres , are issued annually by the municipal centers , while the industry has already taken on the effects of further mi@@ tigation transactions on already over@@ la@@ sty transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who do not have any means for un@@ just del@@ e@@ ations and similar ones - in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ priced , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these jurisdictions will lose further 30 percent of its Federal resources . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council , revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only become worse without the abolition of the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ land Common centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; folks who leave violent relations , leave people with uns@@ ur@@ able and pressing debt , families who were released by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the German government will cut by 30 percent , which means that thousands of helpl@@ ess people will be forced from Queensland , with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General@@ ate General and Federal Minister of Minister of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its commitment to raise funds for legal support on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer @-@ communities , as well as that the government invested Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work . &quot;

the incident described in a indictment that was submitted on Wednesday in the state of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i was submitted to a former software program for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave to , for months to have waited , that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the government parties and CD@@ U are significant . &quot;
&quot; this took representative surveys of the opinion research , IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government of government could rise in north , this is not possible after the re@@ frac@@ turing in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue to set up the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD of 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent rus@@ hed to 24 percent prior to five years . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is therefore only just before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the Left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the day of land . &quot;
&quot; in spite of easier losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again in the sword day . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent in the day of land .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD of the survey came to only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they therefore sm@@ iled behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; the Af@@ D would be present for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives , 14 percent . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return on a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in contem@@ plate : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came across the market .
the successor today dominate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the unit wei@@ ghed almost a half kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
on the contrary it was quite knock .
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would take place today for about two sel@@ fish@@ ings with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone &apos;s time of the internet era . &quot;
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had previously announced the product a few months before at CeBIT at CeBIT in Hanover , Germany as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser if also qu@@ int@@ end slowly .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found themselves .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. approximately 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the cell as@@ parag@@ us of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
the market today vendors who got all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always online , which is today for very many people everyday . &quot;
2015 there have been almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold were approximately 1.4 billion devices , made on Samsung and Apple alone , alone 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
worldwide sales with devices is about 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the paid app provider and tele@@ communication companies come from . &quot;
all around the smartphone has now developed an entire industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came in early 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and a Internet communication , all per touch @-@ screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; today , the iPhone started by Apple , is still the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night . &quot;
&quot; eventually it disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
they now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention is a matter of course .
&quot; in the cut @-@ cut , each of the Germans now looks at his mobile phone today . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to get the smartphone even times , &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the olymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring you into our local municipalities and throughout London but throughout the country &apos;s renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , it presented the greatest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as at that time in 2012 , when we operate a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will come again by offering new opportunities for or@@ ts@@ resident and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we will already set up 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of expansion He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ el on the world stage .
the doubts had wrong and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to over@@ lap but He@@ a@@ throw answers every asked question .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for a single infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and leaving an understanding of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as in the whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been elected a £ 11 billion infrastructure investments in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , was built up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented tre@@ ach@@ ers of the world . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third tre@@ ach@@ ute which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to draw this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future trade , and create an understanding of skills and employment to be proud of the England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ er &quot; with regard to display block@@ ers &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with Online@@ advertising money according to one of the software manufacturers try to deal with experiments , display block@@ ers , a &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be displaying results on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ post , in which it claimed users to update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that its Des@@ k@@ top@@ page would change the co@@ ding regarding its advertising to make it adver@@ ts to recognize that part of the page advertising is to be difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that there is a new way to cope with the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and @-@ H@@ er @-@ struggle has been underway between the inv@@ ading open source community and the tran@@ sit@@ ers already since the invention of scor@@ ching &quot; &quot; adver@@ ts &quot; &quot; is possible that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest companies in the struggle has been abandoned , a strong indi@@ z is to become a strong indi@@ z , such as worrying adver@@ ts for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people ad t@@ lock@@ ers , almost four times a lot of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users access on Facebook about their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertising 84 percent of advertising takes fac@@ et &apos;s Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on desktop PCs that has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so Facebook investing the investment of such a step as a re@@ warding . &quot;
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that it would be an &quot; indicator of the &quot; ad @-@ fer@@ enz@@ ent@@ ool &quot; to have more control over it on them .
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook agreed that Ad@@ block new filters would be worrying , because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we concentrated instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway over@@ ride
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday when a suspected su@@ icide was over@@ flowing by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars said the police in V@@ aud .
&quot; it is obvious that there is a sweat at the age of 49 , which was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , to go over , to kill themselves . &quot;
it still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police , who , as well as any witness of the incident , asks to report to . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; log@@ istic &quot; step in such a situation , the Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter of Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve was shared . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedest@@ rians run in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the trans@@ lu@@ cent kill@@ ings was acqu@@ itted after having survived a man and killed that in August 2014 there was a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- which had responded to an emergency , -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report on the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate models , the Venus was probably once ind@@ ented . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble the climate of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have picked up with their hot , water @-@ loose surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once in similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously explained that the slow upheav@@ al of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ utch @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also lit up the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be protected from darker times . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent higher .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation expon@@ ates the slow upheav@@ al of the Venus its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of most of the sun heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planetary research . &quot;
&quot; although she was once probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
their oceans dis@@ car@@ ded and its water vap@@ or was burned out of the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained at carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy takes back as a trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in the Colorado and led to a lower co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and convinced that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as Chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in Colorado , with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; over the course of the summer long , I thought much about how I could improve the team to give him more depth , this requires it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination for decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , the Roy announced on 23 May 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; we all appreciate what he did for our organisation , and wish him the best for the future . &quot;
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Jack Adam Awards as the best coach of the League .
&quot; he carried out the association at 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last few years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches reported in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference to return five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ Workers resume talks again , strike strike out of
&quot; the work@@ ings with regard to the remun@@ eration of Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ worker will be exposed , while all the armed parties are suspended for a new discussion at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service providers wood Group became spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea carried out by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ite and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present struggle , &quot; it is said in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some full @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to address the problems new . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage rates of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shortened this year to its contracts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
ratings by the company follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the enterprise gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alised its business activities as a result of its meg@@ at@@ mos@@ pher@@ es with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are located due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , economic situation that had intensified through the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament member of Dave Anderson met with workers leaders in the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the biggest issues of work , which have been found in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea with an average of some $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ sh has helped astronom@@ ers , to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates amongst the stars of the star tre@@ ads . &quot;
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers why stars rot@@ ate at different cat@@ ches and in what context are the rotation areas with the planetary development .
&quot; we hope that we experience the same of our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ day of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster which have emerged from around 125 million years ago now reach the adult .
they are now turning on the fastest .
top rates of peak rates meet these gri@@ pping stars large amounts of star @-@ winds .
&quot; as this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star age , its red @-@ rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each one @-@ star by recognis@@ ing the time between the show of a recognizable star fle@@ x@@ ies -- like sun@@ spots -- see .
the latest catalogue of red rates points out that massive stars revol@@ ves slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dances , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ds turn smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ dog of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars slow down their rot@@ ations and say their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in best days from base to base .
&quot; following his emotional feedback , the 41 years old professional on the 12th of August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays will take a last time the tri@@ but@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ dbye &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the League in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature among a tenth of year was given him 27 million US dollars since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be in the future as a consultant and youth coach - with full content . &quot;
as player paid it a Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some milestones . &quot;
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays point only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not yet accepted for the 41 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; in the field was so controversial , its appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was given to have taken death in 2009 , between 2001 and 2003 stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked in the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; biogas scandal &quot; &quot; until the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be main @-@ suspi@@ cion for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida powerful means .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing probe must not start weight @-@ the@@ ad Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing .
a caught Ath@@ ali@@ an would have won almost a medal .
in front of the seventh day day the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; the Chinese wh@@ ites in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical funeral of athle@@ tics , these messages come to the accident . &quot;
at Ch@@ en had already been proven the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday used as a mas@@ quer@@ ading means for dop@@ ing sub@@ versions .
the International Sport Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze . &quot;
the Friday would have to participate in the curtains over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing requested at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation among the studies , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of Sports and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history no longer is the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ itation of athletes , with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ ed the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , thus the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; be inno@@ cent , &quot; the only declaration could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the glue . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act in the prescribed substance by the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians President Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov was immediately made with criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ an word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
in this way all wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ters may not take part in the chronic @-@ offering nation in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; was known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days prior to the an@@ abolic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
&quot; both deny the intake , however both may not start in the class until 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ sters , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further difficult blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , including the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya , in Rio numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the previous los@@ ers in China had also taken care of the earlier disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the French@@ man of Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun yang p@@ ink@@ ing@@ li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot;
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and respect for dop@@ ing , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ onships positively on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ eck her ran@@ som
programmers of Er@@ compres@@ sing Mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
&quot; according to a recent survey of Mal@@ ware resistance specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies have been at least once in the past twelve months , partially several times victims of an attack with black@@ smith software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware of a ran@@ som@@ ware . &quot;
40 percent of victims paid willing to use the perpetrators required by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ press software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they are successful there , it falls significantly higher than for private users . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to be sent to advertising .
then discovered the perpetrators of black@@ press@@ software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private uses were the goal , but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months of start@@ ling quickly . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it seeks targeted files such as Word@@ , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ press . &quot;
&quot; to get the final code code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where for private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is tac@@ kled . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business completely , in case of a case people were aware of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you thus promotes only the problem &quot; , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , will receive their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators . &quot;
the h@@ acker again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a current study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the commercial areas and contact with the black@@ outs and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct accessible support websites , or de@@ code free of charge files . &quot;
&quot; and become private @-@ workers after payments of a few hundred euros , companies must have partly tough negotiate and five @-@ digit sums pay to return their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk of profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , security experts of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; perhaps more likely , it is however , that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ smith .
&quot; the previous Mal@@ ware kits created by the Mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ smith are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so , one log@@ ins in one of the forums in the underground , the set of a crime and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per user @-@ made computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then bear sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful encouragement , the perpetrators with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pri@@ ori@@ cul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damages potential is higher depending on the type of data that is still a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators would be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the Internet . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they could get used with the Internet verb@@ ati@@ es Thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the Fre@@ isch@@ ers of such a decreased heating could be quite a ran@@ som at all times . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators then block the heating into a factory rather than the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware may also be an issue in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday du@@ sty
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little bit of UV , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; it sounds pretty crowded , but the HR @-@ V , that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , it does not work closely at any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit side falls something out . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; it is not only a trunk area of 4@@ 53 l at high and 10@@ 26 l at the disposal , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bank leave such as Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well ventil@@ ated , however the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide ranges of speed .
&quot; however , he is likely to do something qui@@ eter . &quot;
encouraging is the day @-@ to @-@ day consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ time drive is not offered .
the chassis is balanced ; a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment can be found in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
&quot; among the security systems , the City @-@ not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works until 32 ) , the coll@@ isions war@@ n@@ system and the sp@@ ur@@ hal@@ te@@ ass@@ istent . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions war@@ ner sometimes , because in the ran@@ kings , many obstacles are assessed as &quot; her@@ ding objects . &quot; &quot;
&quot; very reliable , the remote @-@ light works . &quot;
and the intelligent tempor@@ al drives responds to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ sm@@ s when required the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly awk@@ ward .
the around 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel engines are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 down@@ gas .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday @-@ du@@ sty car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on flight bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; for a liability is conceivable only in danger that are typical of the air transport , argu@@ ably the upper national Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the overthrow of a knee era .
&quot; however , the accident could happen everywhere - it handles to be a general risk , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to no damage to the man .
disease : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their journey , tourists will only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in which the case was a family on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ ei@@ ur@@ lau@@ bs hard on diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
it spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that supposedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey had been faul@@ tless - and mour@@ ned against the organizer .
in court the applicant had no success .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact def@@ ective .
&quot; however , the promot@@ er first took place shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff . &quot;
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contam@@ in@@ ants were found .
&quot; the condition of several hotel guests - perhaps by infection by infection , belonging to one another - belonging to the general risk of life . &quot;
&quot; from 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , following the violence of violence in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state had to stand up and decided to respond to terror at the same time .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we will not give the terrorists to terrorists .
&quot; if pen@@ alties would have to leave the country faster , but the level of safety and strength is also the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère want to reach the implementation of the proposals by the Parliament &apos;s Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ a strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; in the middle @-@ vi@@ ous magnitude of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be back under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is expected to improve the weapon of weapons , that especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed welding for doctors should remain arch@@ ed according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the doctors &quot; to find solutions like the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at some mental symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social care needed . &quot;
teachers would have to better be prepared for the handling of traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister , clearly spoke against action . &quot;
&quot; that was a ear@@ head for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had res@@ igned by the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship previously rejected .
a general ban on the full level of authority he is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you can not ban everything you want , and I rest on the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
you could talk about rules about road traffic or witness to witnesses .
green boss in Simone Peter threw the Minister before he wanted to simul@@ ate with always new anti @-@ terror packaging and scope of action .
&quot; left Party chief Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Spr@@ ü@@ che &quot; &quot; and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the common right bring the people in this country no longer . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway
it is on a regular basis regularly on the road @-@ road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers who are travelling on the ambient road every night in St@@ au , when they drive over the motorway of Ar@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road building road extends to the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the departure of Wes@@ el , road around 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then turn right away from the hammer road on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic shares early , making the total flow of procedures at the busy section of the federal road 51 improved . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district German representation Münster @-@ West .
the chassis on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 7 p.m .
&quot; dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ west path , and sometimes beyond that . &quot;
&quot; for reason , the needle is on the B 51 just before the departure of Wes@@ eler Street . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic only gives one lane about the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built in front of a well @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have yiel@@ ded that the bridge has no longer the required power power to include especially the heavy @-@ load traffic .
&quot; how long this Eng@@ pass and the connected daily St@@ au will not say , the responsible country cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to be reck@@ oned : because the bridge has an official rest until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal body , the inland has deliberately visited the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on to the site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the Verein N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece of &quot; Das invisible house &quot; of the boy theater Münster .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; , &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the staging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit the cultural institutions of cultural institutions in Münster , as part of this year . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria came to Münster and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ chan@@ ger images and video animations , be it possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the Verein N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the Young Theatre are working together in the context of a music @-@ theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years should get the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in singing , dance , dance and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ or@@ r@@ ale language skills are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increasing refugee numbers , the association is counting on many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star sn@@ acking : hope for weather repaired
&quot; the weather was made by the star cluster in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany on Friday , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was bad because of clouds and rain bad for watching the cel@@ estial spectacle , said the president of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we &apos;ll see many star sn@@ apshots on the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the star cluster , it is per@@ missible that belong with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star sn@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; their names have their names , because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , coming up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one passes all around the night , at night you are awake to hours , in the morning long before the wake @-@ up drops no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one with such problems is in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent of their sleep often feel or permanently not reco@@ vering . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes behind them , empha@@ sizing Hans @-@ Günter Weber , pre @-@ board member of the German society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand beneath it is , but the in@@ som@@ one is never , so an inhal@@ ing and sle@@ ep@@ al disorder . &quot;
&quot; just the mature many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member of the German house@@ physician association with practice in the German @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , mental or complicated factors , but also medicines are stuck . &quot;
not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another illness .
&quot; very early , it is very early to wake up with depression often , &quot; says We@@ en@@ dar@@ s . &quot;
and it can be that different factors turn each other .
&quot; who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , guarded all two to three hours and begins to greet , over day @-@ to @-@ day problems and care , gives way of wisdom an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when should one with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not a good sleeps over a period of one month at least three nights per week , and it should be com@@ promised to the doctor , &quot;
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is ab@@ be@@ aten , tired , un@@ loaded , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has vocal fluctu@@ ations or bodily ail@@ ments such as stomach or headaches . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , there are changes in behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and maximum for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there are hardly any problems , Professor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Sle@@ eping Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should consult with sleeping problems at first in case of sleep . &quot;
this can be resolved by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should in the dormit@@ ory , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for example , to study in the dormit@@ ory rates of snor@@ ers , for instance in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory waste , in case of sleep , or when one does not find the cause of a diar@@ rhe@@ a disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the c@@ abling one goes to bed at his normal time .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose , a chest strap and a fig ler on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera features a camera on the ceiling . &quot;
how can the problems be able to handle the problems ?
there are quite a lot of positions that can be put to a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ itations counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not to sleep for long in bed , not to sleep for sleeping , alcohol , and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve at all . &quot;

&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , however , very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that do a great deal and not see it precisely with the topic of dop@@ ing , or even running it . &quot;

he wanted to start a com@@ eback already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .

on the facade of a gray house someone has an ugly ! &quot; sc@@ ared .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ d@@ l , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; like the responsible real estate company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in , however , in recent weeks , however , is preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , in the meantime , the residents have been occupied , but on the ground floor are still areas occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior Hen@@ kel , had a hard approach to the police against the project , called the &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22nd the spaces on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , with 300 police officers , were pat@@ rolling up with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , lock@@ smith parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the un@@ familiar house owner the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Court ruled that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers were moved under the j@@ ubil@@ ant of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; left violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living here since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , which is here three children , especially from the police force . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the household projects they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and pur@@ ges .
&quot; it does not sound according to a pine , who had mostly wanted more pol@@ ze@@ al protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , the Berlin interior of the Berlin interior and the police between houses and their neighbors , does not seem so obvious . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city , and has high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; also houses and the born @-@ born projects have been occupied for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared up at a ver@@ ge with large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people today , who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the part of the city has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and election liner from all over the world : people from the GDR and former houses are occupied by them . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : it recognises the dis@@ ks or freshly gest@@ ed fac@@ ades that were thrown with colors .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours see that as a problem may be , that it is not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily violation , according to poli@@ c@@ emen , according to poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the criminal criminal off@@ ences are made , the ten@@ den@@ zi@@ ell rather the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , cannot be any talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; for as far as violence is concerned , it is in@@ important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who would not have been determined . &quot;
also the famous burning cars make it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street - and stayed .
&quot; that is why it was so important that the inhabitants get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : through sighted new buildings in former buildings that sup@@ press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are finally property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not fail . &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if one never ends anyone ? &quot;
&quot; there is in all sides frustration , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for frozen , angry about colour bombs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house@@ work and the left scene belonged to the pine . &quot;
&quot; who is pulling , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , there can be bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons with first names have asked for , not to be called by their real name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee camps
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the administration of the administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , working group refugees , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else is still missing . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the colleague Award indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that deu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ ghty W@@ oll@@ ard sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; thus , some - less mo@@ ve@@ than rather than on the multitude of desire @-@ wish @-@ areas - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; searched for was an administrative supplier with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an amazing W@@ oll@@ ard sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point for a period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and full @-@ full actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and liability problems . &quot;
soon new containers stand in the washing road
&quot; a heavy problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting non @-@ customs duties , which have been acknowledged . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for connecting systems .
they must accommodate the refugees in your own or rented apartment rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the country to the Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
&quot; so far , it does not work so you are dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments have to be visited , as it is so nice . &quot;
so soon new containers can soon be placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keywords , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , there are internship places , training , school courts , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and helpl@@ ess activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help Haus@@ smann , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity is not only working .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a belonging feeling .
&quot; so , it will need offers like sports , contacts with locals , and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , also , jump here management and volunteers . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it is just taking it and they can make sense to a sense , for example , in a language course . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone , do not need to work and be un@@ selfish , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also a problem , but also says customer honest , &quot; people , with whom nothing goes . &quot; &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two most recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; what some man@@ cher nai@@ v may be . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko can and does not shut it out . &quot;
sensitive are the hel@@ pers but already .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
who would have the fear that the attacks they have complete in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , head and volunteers must hold on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; this question clearly to answer , shy the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not yet arrived where we would like &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher are also already lau@@ ghing up with the previous people .
&quot; this is currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need , you have to help them both women agree . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated because there is no simple answers .
