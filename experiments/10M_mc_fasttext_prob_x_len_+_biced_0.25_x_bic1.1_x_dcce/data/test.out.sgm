<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And in this way the horsemen ended up again then again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tournament siege - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he left himself with his family on the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't get time for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was really convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help ranged the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small Gala with the Golden Sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">On awards it is not a sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesveretakers, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year..."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential statements are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Who has the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubts rather small and warns that as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wool the economy to death in death and to regulate death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be completely different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return to regulations, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform - for private people and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton against it says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil; he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say nearly wortequal."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, you could still have partial internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">"clearly, the differences in the energy and climate policies are clear."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and redrive the coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas that wants to announce the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton on the other hand wants to expand and encourage renewable energy with its investment programme," a country will create the superpower of the clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only at the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreements, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US does not want to isolate international trade by international trade - but simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the should then be paid better, calls for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase her on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump in this question wants, is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rinsed, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him before, so that the budgetary deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women, who flee alone, almost for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby who is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother lay down on the top plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene affects normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the department of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and among other things, deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are strained.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has taken care of the furnishings along with Pro Familia and the Munich's women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">"unlong ago, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not excessive to say: every woman who arrives here has taken on her escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are being pursued politically because they torture torture or death, or because their families send them as hopelessness to Europe," she tells. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there were other reasons for the escape:" many steals secretly, because they do not see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home, they have experience with sexual violence, constraints, honorary morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tractor for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, the women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worse if misused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in Munich to the north, traumatized them."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary created."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust, talking about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not help you know, it will need more accommodations just for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction area, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken around there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, only found women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are some common accommodation units or own houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy or men and women are accommodated together, it may be - constant - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and accessible for women easily, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women of this protection might be felt, one can read the urge that there is in Munich on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since she has been talking about, we have a long queued list," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outdoor laterals"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart to the St. Petersburg Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace's palace in reception, I cannot resist the expression that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smurry smurry and shining a little bit of heat, even for its backward conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but can even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so would never happen something bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to be more of the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable radile showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his confession: the shooting of a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutentated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out and accused Ankara to please Russia in their backs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it was even greater, since it was committed by a alleged friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veins will be rebuilding difficult when not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unresolved attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to carry out the Turks for all that blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from the President Erdogan which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly on hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first and foremost all the friends he can get after he dismissed the last month at a curved coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has gone back by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal anstorm of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week forecast, the state television foresees fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemographic sti pointed out the following way:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an extra political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because its response to the tried-to-use of power has been seen as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued Groll about the snacking-empo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is to pull out the cool mood and lessen the relation of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty for sure that he asked for the tried state of state aid to the elected government.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a sense of understanding, even deeper fear of regimechange."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible to represent Russia and Turkey, as a analyst once described," "Alliance of external laterals" ": two countries that are rejected and badly treated by the West and now fade away."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peace stand, but where Russia and Turkey support antagonisms."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, both presidents spoke at the press conference, that they could not even comprehend the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey formied it deliberately to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfection, the NATO member Turkey of the Russian martial jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of heads at least come back to one another."</seg>

<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV transmitter on Friday with that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow Mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest conspirators Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet Intelligence that KGB.</seg>

<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once more directed to the Russian environmental policy - came to a great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, Ivanov said, Ivanov said, Ivanov said, Ivanov said, Ivanov said that I have asked you at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was deputy prime minister and Minister of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) was the president of the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin, he called off in power as Putin called he Ivanov as one of five people, whom he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had to violate the constitution."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is the first of four resolutions of the" cover blower, "which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons concrete, as well as 46 Schrägseile."</seg>

<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the delay between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the whole bridge finished in their place and the last section of the Decks is now in Rosyth a betongation for the deck, meaning that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors are going to be much stronger in the duty of the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300-cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "action concept" "to the next Ratscreen."</seg>
<seg id="5">But arguments is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we are united with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, in future, 20 percent of all apartments must be dealt with as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also occur in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big dispute in the Town Hall is however, thus Bratmann:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban residential building program, which will cost millions and will still be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, thus Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the factions. ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few provisions as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left will still have hardness conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of it, thus Bratmann, make a sharpening of the situation in the apartment market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the action concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not entirely up-to-date: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"how do you change the loss of further 1,300 cheap apartments, promoting the promotion over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Only up to 2020 will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the planning-policy spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the town."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get back to the pricing again."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one stroke will be able to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the end of the Western city run by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the pricing for affordable housing there.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: these are the owners who do not want construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"after all, the number of social housing in the West town is again dramatically increased, one can be removed from the target of the so-called throughmixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There will no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be even more exercise in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader, Chairman Herlitschke says:" for a wide majority the CDU must have with the boat. "</seg>
<seg id="34">These have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes.</seg>

<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of popculture sank interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players with their smartphones go outside and look for Pokémons who are following a GPS and once found," "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays this Pokémon Go - it just sees the rough data on performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigning on health, people want to take" "30 minutes of time" "to get involved" "from the sofa" "and every day to be active on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring and come from people who look elly."</seg>

<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships.</seg>

<seg id="25">And yes. someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drift sports as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and the use will be eliminated with time.</seg>

<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female Turnero was one Afro-Americanerin.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This indicates strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics winning and America was cheered.</seg>

<seg id="18">"but the reality looks so that Turning a more expensive sport is and Turner will be maintained primarily in private turnaround, which are maintained for training, furniture, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their turner and families). the list can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these verses, the Turner will receive their entire training and that is for families a real and long-term commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, Trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainers of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tower."</seg>

<seg id="4">In front of each object he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to be in.</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was identified under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "some surprising results were brought to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the flush knob has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact it is in a kitchen rinse more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left behind, what he woke up, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was well known to test the resilience of his Darms, travelled through the world and had an amazing as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to sink of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health affects and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sleewater. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test coating showed a luminometers of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this the lamuminometers is fresh-fired hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused, after their lambs over 4000 units was, while freshly curved hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel" "The Lickhiker" "Guide to Inner Strength" "which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I have in a toilet, close. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing bad thing than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not show anything here, because it is indoors here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company designates Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says," We really wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy brainstormings by doing so that we said" Lass us Ian calling. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the gut and how it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala that led the direction of the film added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he would have made some of the things I have made him to leak, just like the ekelective Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things when it was easier to bring Ian to bringing it up and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">"I am glad, that we have recorded some of these dirty goodies."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in any survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents in the year 2015 associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally using products, which include massacres rebacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before calling for the comment to oversaw it, in order to oversaw it under the alias of non-aging old men's disease, this statement leads from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the most pronounced redevelopment of sound plates not to a boom in Millennials, who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but due to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older plate clears keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I lie in the middle of a busy street in Soho, just before I steward off my hands and say something certain as:" "so, let us look at a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos slowly takes place at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of special record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera, asking the camera off for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed by Sister Ray (data number: eight young men, a woman probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sounding records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by him at home), dress the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy records which he did not afford to buy and again buy items that he sold, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 1960s, early 70ies who appeared out when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records, are rather introverted and likes to spend time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink not very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who will have heard about the comeback, and caused to see their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have been removed so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who sold their plates sold to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to get back their plates again, he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the record-change of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to the stability of trusted gramplattends, of objects, the blissful Jugenderinnations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff of a plate pile. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people purchased last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably be very worried while being petrified by a pile of wicksa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42 who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle aged) has noticed a" "trophy of the Revivals". ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently arrived here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead Schallplate, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it is definitely going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more produced, less musically-clamp."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people, who say:" I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who only come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fstop, which has devoted the sound plates almost a whole floor has a bump public, when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos, teenager and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the pre-standing shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizers and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz cycles out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees sometimes lonely, but naating mental traumata are hard to be determined if one stands next to someone 30 seconds in addition."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variation of the plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a window-inherited than a major purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so the collecting of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of plates... it is driving with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a store, which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban outitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I would like to give the Anans hotel to mustern, I watch a group of young teenager, which grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think of buying a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"to the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my descendants have taken the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors" s and record female women who exist in reality, record business and in Onlineforen. "</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"you will not spend their Thursday tomorrow with the Bumble through records from Berwick Street and the leaf by plates, while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year old moderator, which rises over the shoulders nothing ahneness of the men of middle-aged."</seg>

<seg id="4">"thus, immigrant Islamic faith or the Middle East will diffusion the Middle East in extremist way."</seg>
<seg id="5">"therefore, we observe the movement now."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" "identity movement" "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it turns against" Multikulti-Wahn, "" uncontrolled mass immigration "and" loss of one's own identity by alienation. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"constitutional Conductors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identities "already."</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said his authority is closely coordinated with the state offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the" "identity movement" "try to pick up their target group where it stands," "said the Constitutional Court."</seg>
<seg id="11">"generally trying extremists to speak with youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Islamists, as well as right-wing extremism."</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not any kind of publicity for your own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda should address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are very susceptible in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"recently, it had given reports of contacts of the" "identities" "for AfD-politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"to constitutional protection, the possible contacts of this kind will only be relevant to a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the particular party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals, the extremist extremist, changes its target and so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">"so, whether such individuals have controlled influence over the party."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view of the significant increase in extreme crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maate, he would not speak in this connection not yet from new right terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have noticed that there can be right-going structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Free Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it can be quite noticeable that further justifiable groups or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee or attacks from other right-wing extremism."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a clear or Europe-wide control of justification but not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Maate concerned themselves that many persuasions went to the account of people who had not stepped into the right scene before."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the fact suspects in attacks on asylum-revenues were not known as criminals, politically motivated criminal law or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people therefore have committed crimes that were perhaps right with right wing, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or for example CDU, SPD or left which, however, were radicalised through far-right mood."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Republique, secret service representative and the Wehrmacht, reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analyses, which reported how preset their estimations to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"news service information, which were typically decreased by high-level CentCom commanders, periodically reported a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism and were all positive as analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering, when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented, Ken Calvert, Republicanese member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The management error in CentCom are up to the top point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report gives detailed profound problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence to change that government tips on Obama statements submitted, it shows how analysts looked at the pressure from its predecessors, also known as analysts or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom was publicly known publicly that a military reconquest Mossuls can begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress from Kansas, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tops of Central Command changed the following recording reports to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to live after them was played that analysts are concerned with the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation is continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports have been underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"democratic members of the news service sector, published on Thursday their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 the CentCom has provided an overly restricted process for the creation of commencement services on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," provided the "" strangely "" commander in the House of Representatives Adam B. ship, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, such as Mr. ship," delayed the publication of following reports reports, "replicated the morals among analysts and" gave overly little room for softer views. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no references to an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts, with regard to a certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported from investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which have been received after complaints from CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman on the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence had no reports of Congress while the investigations of the general spector would be still going on."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also gave that" experts sometimes have absolutely diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Defense Department would welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"the investigations have taken effect on the issue of a successful aircampaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion, which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense)."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have rejected the question of how far President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honorable military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism regarding the secret formations over the Islamic state remind of constraints of more than ten years, as the then government under George W. Bush saw against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation in Iraq, and have little time on it, to reflect on the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to indicate government attacks against the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisioning refineries had been put into operation since these provisioning refineries had to sell in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="5">"you cannot turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue, without over Simone Biles, Katie Leappy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's warm with congratulations, would have been able to have been sent to Prime Time, built through sponsors and feel free advertising if he would be a swimmers, turner or even feekeepers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not commonly recognized: air gun shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest and may it have long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but when I have modest arguments for my particular darling, then leave me the attention of the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only one erased enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartoon trembling of his never-going clouds - but also the Grazie of gym and diving, the two sports that unites it essentially."</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during clashes with the police in scusssion.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last few months, protests against the government and the country had become more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week rushed thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organizations, the response of the government was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave witnesses that policemen were shot on land of unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the run-run videos on the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year, how security people show young people with staves, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is more than Nigeria the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopian to fight terrorist attacks across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy was expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendullerene in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly overthrew the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents have been silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or in the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground-use to the spice grip in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a further critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a struggle to these jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of Ogades, which in recent years have been forced to exploit the turbulence and could armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of embitation after years of the weathering has now exploded under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as more smart phones have always been more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in Protest, does many people still communicate via internet proxies which will hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians made that she met so as protracted.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons of prospered the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian highlands, in politics and business, while the Oromos are exploited, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests occurred in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigers, which constitute around 6 percent of the population and those in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics are dominant."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as tactical genius, a man who could think about the corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly discredited in this, early signs of dissatisfaction to perceive and use special, to edit opponents and to make it unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this fundamental sense," "Mr Abdi said," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian of new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively uncareful reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr Hailenavam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he did not enjoy the confidence of the control of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, that Ethiopia was experienced for such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections were seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following blade, many protesters were killed, although there were less than in the past months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia guide for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new pendulum, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters attacked protesters in Gondar, a amharischen city, by Tigray guided shops and the hatred against the Tigray is always more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronym flights over the neighboured Somalia, even though she recently worked out that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to be collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin grathike."</seg>

<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was unlike the previous day when Mr. Trump in a series of interviews said, he said the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radiomoderator, Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to weaken the statement by taking it from it, that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, he wanted to know the Republican presidential race of nothing of it."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July he made strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians should freeze Mrs. Clinton Emails, but he later said" "Of course I said this sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted a still relative note because its refractional values have gone back."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was released on Friday showed a lead with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for its provocative statements, he frequently accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>

<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps of most prominent people, gave themselves great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was interviewed to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in this sense it is true that Obama ISIS an almost unknown, small organisation, he called her backbone, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government used under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign minister, ISIS allowed to spread out, spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressively."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before, on each of his words, and be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he hailed the" poor, junuch, "TV experts who try to understand and said," they cannot!. "</seg>

<seg id="9">"this one of the long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal" Science "at least from an Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock these life span, which means a world-chord for spinal cord. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly the evolutionary biologist has long been that Greenland of Greenland is stagnant.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-hay are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the icmeer in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of the Greenland-haie, researchers know according to little ones."</seg>

<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt asleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the iceeres and are looking for carcasses which are from higher water layers to down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as a concatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 inches long, while the largest 502 inches measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14-method the lens of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eye lens has already been created before the birth of the sharks that the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after the early 1960s, their birth should lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, large amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are scattered."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of 220 centimeters in length, the third-smallest animal contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all the larger Greenland-hay had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens with cosmic radiation, which arises in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335, during the record-Hai with 502 centimeters, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old might be."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland, Greenland only then descgrew, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign the length of an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably on the threshold to the genital mature and his age with 156 years, Greenland is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this might be the case for vertebrates currently world-ord.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose speck at the neck, a 120 year old harpokes pointed, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures it is often running the organism of the animals living there on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they are more mature later - and aligning slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal can handle heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">Heat loss from one gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the ankerchief, who had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the young squad made up his legend, when he was stormed home to win a victory of the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago a shocking victory while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">"she repeated the trick, after she in March at the rail World Championship in London despite the back of the back, Hoys were just a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver's Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired created a gap that was trying to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they stayed in when they saw potential in the villi that has now developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner set out over four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner finished in the qualifying round a olymparekord, but in the standard people the New Zealand triumphs in the first round."</seg>

<seg id="12">"Hinder was shortly back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>

<seg id="14">"Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes on the podium."</seg>

<seg id="17">"in the final, we set up a olymparekord and defeated the world champion."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the Triumph 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys gave us hints that he fell on the way after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later moved this statement later and there was no objection to England Rivals.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one passes all around the night, at night you are awake to hours, in the morning long before the wake-up drops no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one with such problems is in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep and more than ten per cent of their sleep often feel or permanently not recovering."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many causes behind them, emphasizing Hans-Günter Weber, pre-board member of the German society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand beneath it is, but the insomone is never, so an inhaling and sleepal disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just the mature many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German housephysician association with practice in the German-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, mental or complicated factors, but also medicines are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early, it is very early to wake up with depression often," says Weendars. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors turn each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who for example has a slipped disk, can be bad, guarded all two to three hours and begins to greet, over day-to-day problems and care, gives way of wisdom an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not a good sleeps over a period of one month at least three nights per week, and it should be compromised to the doctor,"</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is abbeaten, tired, unloaded, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has vocal fluctuations or bodily ailments such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, there are changes in behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional cases and maximum for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany there are hardly any problems, Professor Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleeping Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should consult with sleeping problems at first in case of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be resolved by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should in the dormitory, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, to study in the dormitory rates of snorers, for instance in case of snoring with respiratory waste, in case of sleep, or when one does not find the cause of a diarrhea disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose, a chest strap and a fig ler on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera features a camera on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the problems be able to handle the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions that can be put to a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weitations counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not to sleep for long in bed, not to sleep for sleeping, alcohol, and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is not conducive at all."</seg>

<seg id="6">"reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime, the residents have been occupied, but on the ground floor are still areas occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior Henkel, had a hard approach to the police against the project, called the" "No-Go Zone" "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after June 22nd the spaces on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, were patrolling up with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, locksmith parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with number 94."</seg>

<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers were moved under the jubilant of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living here since 1999, and Jana *, which is here three children, especially from the police force."</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the household projects they share the concern for rising rents and purges.</seg>

<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009."</seg>

<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words" "leftist violence". ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee camps</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, it is a social worker on site."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee commissioned for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the administration of the administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact person for all players: refugees, working group refugees, administrations, authorities and who else is still missing."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the colleague Award indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that deuschle now is, the eighty Wollard sau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"thus, some - less movethan rather than on the multitude of desire-wish-areas - meant, as the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for was an administrative supplier with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an amazing Wollard sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point for a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honors and full-full actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and liability problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a heavy problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting non-customs duties, which have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting systems.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in your own or rented apartment rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the country to the Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so you are dependent on private apartments, so Deuterle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments have to be visited, as it is so nice."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers can soon be placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keywords, Regine customer and Annika deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, there are internship places, training, school courts, one-Euro-jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help Haussmann, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity is not only working.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a solid structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a belonging feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, it will need offers like sports, contacts with locals, and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, also, jump here management and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it is just taking it and they can make sense to a sense, for example, in a language course."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach anyone, do not need to work and be unselfish, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also a problem, but also says customer honest," people, with whom nothing goes. "" the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two most recent incidents fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer clearly," "what some mancher naiv may be." a Restrisiko can and does not shut it out. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive are the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">Who would have the fear that the attacks they have complete in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, head and volunteers must hold on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question clearly to answer, shy the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we would like" "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher are also already laughing up with the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"this is currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"however, if people are in need, you have to help them both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated because there is no simple answers.</seg>
