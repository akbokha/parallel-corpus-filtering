Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as a destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; but on meeting this , however , it is also a question of conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stra@@ ined for years .
Washington den@@ otes the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Netanyahu lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; through the deal &apos;s promoted deal for Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu held the invitation of the Republi@@ can , in front of the US Congress a controversial speech , held partly as an affair against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked about with Obama , a meeting had opposed this reference to the time im@@ pending election in Israel . &quot;
in a notation conf@@ esses Professor of his girlfriend to have shot
&quot; in an Not@@ call , Professor Sh@@ annon was told with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ al voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and had to have had his office coming to his house . &quot;
&quot; represented was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited is , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that ever loved me . this was according to the authorities of the letter in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no notice that represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , subject to 300 miles at the school ground , where he shot a popular history of history for the Delta State , E@@ constituted Schmidt , at the door to his office , and killed . &quot;
Delta State State University Political Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ es employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he had made a fatal emergency call upon that time afterwards .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb re@@ took into life with the police when the police took him .
&quot; one day after g@@ im@@ ing in the university , the students and teachers get forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what was motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details that were published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as what students and collaborators experienced him , said , helped create an image by a talented , but potentially difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their classes .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have any history of violence or crime . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned himself in a written book written by him , where he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both were under@@ mined in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher has 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who was praised , said , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , as if something were wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that lamb told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
&quot; represented before , the Delta State University had asked for a protective reason for health reasons and said he was just some kind of health problem . &quot;
this year he applied only two online courses .
&quot; recent amendments to the university &apos;s employment policies , meant that the promotion , had worked so hard for him to make an automatic way to an employment as a Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; university &apos;s former president William La@@ For@@ ge , he know nothing of a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
these are questions that cannot be answered anymore .
&quot; after the flight from the campus the police were later crossed by Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as imports . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , he had to be arrested for one .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent &apos;s house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ tes Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb was going to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
represented in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and was responsible for geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he rehear@@ sed fourth in spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ term friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried over a couple of years to teach her guitar game . &quot;
he was then the woman &apos;s warm .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
represented and p@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the Not@@ call said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog called lightning who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that borders on a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en said , they were gone 15 years ago but have stayed friends and had a daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos; Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos; Ste@@ en said he never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; represented a lau@@ re@@ out , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood three years ago both in a summer year . &quot;
later they played together one or the other .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter and sings her own music .
p@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ten@@ ders and sometimes negoti@@ ators at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , said he had discovered and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September last time he had stopped his guitar player and Mund@@ arg@@ iel finished before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was not wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the edge and che@@ ered .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead Professor , led the premiere seminar programme and specialized in American native language and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell , professor at school , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the Stu@@ dents Committee .
&quot; at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ veland on Tuesday evening , about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the church are part of a candle light party . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts Mrs Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the ma@@ vi@@ l ; during the Universal Mor@@ ning Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; says La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans , amoun@@ ted to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police officers , now , that the police had shot that he had shot by his wife , and that the Lamb told him as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to set less labour for the Christmas time

Michael J. Fox jo@@ kes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater wait for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gets slowly to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am making a simul@@ ated pe@@ el and a ar@@ tery length of it , with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;

UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon , imposing his response to Russia &apos;s greater military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of men . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the annual general meeting held in this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and of the Regional powers &quot; shall make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an demanded that five permanent members , when tackling the crisis in Syria , have demonstrated the same solidarity and unity that they proved to be in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 Re@@ frac@@ tional values indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is taking serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( still ) not working . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range and some start to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no claim that Tr@@ ump probably won the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts acc@@ entu@@ ated that during this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain in 2011 and none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have in a general choice to fight .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bus @-@ Super PAC , and the conservative Group Club for Growth recognize now Tr@@ umps stamina and start to release their dollars to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps exposure values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump stopped its can@@ did@@ acy to mid June , demonstrated a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University , that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
to mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers live in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has noted last week that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy to catch up as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they would either be &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if the dump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; 40 percent , who say the same about dump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters tell 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; angry &quot; if everyone is the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans does not see Tr@@ umps temper@@ ament .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and Belgian statements , 52 percent of the real temper@@ ament for president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is true in the first op@@ tic state of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 per cent of re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for an commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to perform effectively and almost six out of 10 Independent says that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they picked up their schol@@ ar @-@ , Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
if they are asked to tell who the GO@@ P @-@ nom@@ ination wins the GO@@ P last week after a survey by CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten end of July you put the money into je@@ b Bush . &quot;
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est Crystal in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans , Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination was against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a wide variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters Tr@@ umps campaign as a chat in view . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans have gathered for another candidates , then Tr@@ ump gets almost everybody . &quot;
some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umps leadership during the anti @-@ step support spread to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ us .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority support is harvested . &quot;
&quot; he has before C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , prior to Walker Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scarce majority by Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have been formed .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that just over half the voters support Tr@@ ump , saying that they have awarded their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much could happen to change , and no one can truly say that change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , the most out competition is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ite , the neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are dou@@ ble@@ at twice as often as Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election out@@ si@@ ders had begun two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; was the immigration script and fishing point in public discourse to 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic out@@ lay of Tr@@ ump &apos;s former Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will hold away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the New @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , 6 out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , there will Donald Tr@@ ump apparently do . &quot;
the frustration for the climb over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
&quot; by Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , comes about half of the aid of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their external status status . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post ; they prefer a political external se@@ ite as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg at Iowa 2 weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Republi@@ can in Congress using 54 per cent &quot; and 21 percent &quot; nuts .
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential parts of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive dwelling @-@ station - with a view over the North Sea .
a one @-@ square meters in the street costs an area of a th@@ read@@ ed house in the 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euro area . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer is limited to objects of nature , it is stated in the study - that is therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study reveals in which particular layers will cost one square meter in most cases .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ living , one of the prize is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ran@@ kings of the most exclusive German residential locations - high @-@ performance premium at square prices .
&quot; there are several tens of thousand Euros - per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot;

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ stra@@ ende thanks to Müller and Go@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ ry Tor@@ ry in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a thank@@ fully called by Thomas Müller on the FC Bayern gives the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start @-@ up of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have prevented FC Bayern in Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel from Piraeus a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the crew of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their night in the Champions League at the Greek record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hottest atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) . earn 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth success in series should be the first step towards the finals on May 28th , 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
Müller received at his 28th reward in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guided visit by the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto which caused an flan@@ k of the world &apos;s thought .
&quot; we won &apos;t be underestimated , &quot; had Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ aj@@ akis k@@ akis , promised A@@ 6@@ 88 The flowers of hot fans - and the Mün@@ chner had thought . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without neglec@@ ting .
&quot; Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the King @-@ Class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 also proud Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; yet Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they were courageous to be courageous , with their offensive efforts , but often in@@ comprehensible to works . &quot;
the attacks came too often by the wr@@ apping of left untreated Douglas Costa which is rarely through the former Braunschweig Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had been lucky from the right more fortunate than struck its side down on the right semi @-@ ground in the left top of the top .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ bo@@ ov@@ sky .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head@@ ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct repe@@ aled the Tor@@ ino Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
&quot; although Bavaria came up to her dom@@ ly play , Pir@@ ates could put in pirates . &quot;
on top of Tor@@ b@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was but Lost .
so about as he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a quadru@@ ple chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat at first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was only given after the audi@@ tor &apos;s green light , Matthias said Sports Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; who wants to make something else of it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also at the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Le@@ w@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) .
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything , thanks to the I@@ f@@ metres , Müller still placed a dr@@ au@@ ght . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ all in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly be@@ amed Bayern @-@ fans in their audience block , apparently , the supporters of hosts were obviously prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went up with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bavaria fan was wounded out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk to lose teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , therefore obli@@ ges not only of the lungs , but also the counter - which is a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : if rep@@ airing the risk is rapid .
smokers have a clearly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is what happens from the long @-@ term study of a scientific research team , including several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ PE ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers should lose the risk of losing their teeth to shed their teeth , around the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ fold . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; causes of f@@ aries are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , emphasises the DI@@ RE@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ising the authors . &quot;
&quot; the link between smoking and dental loss therefore , therefore , go back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ ums . &quot;
not be clarified to what extent smoking will also increase the risk for tooth decay .
&quot; people being heard with smoking , however you could l@@ essen risk however within a short time , the researchers are writing in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard caused by non @-@ smokers &apos;s level , stated Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich by the British University Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must have to convince people of it , non @-@ smoking , the study leader H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ RE@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels , and leads to our findings also to a good gear through to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , the DI@@ RE@@ E is imp@@ acted by 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of dental employment , shared by DI@@ RE@@ E . &quot;
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking is the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study cur@@ ls the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to raise the debate on the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbitration organisations for disputes between concert and states are expected to be replaced by a more transparent system that is significantly more traditional in its operation .
&quot; we want to establish a system that trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström at the performance . &quot;
the Swedish joined the proposal as a European negotiating base in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world will develop over 800 million people . &quot;
plans to re@@ formation the current arbitration proceedings specifically see that the EU states and the US choose to select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they should come to the same share from the EU , the US and by third countries . &quot;
provided for the first time is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against judg@@ ments .
&quot; so far the procedures involved had involved with each other on refer@@ ee , a contradiction against their judg@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it had become obvious that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;

&quot; there , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could also be clarified . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbitration agreement ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all - one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitr@@ ators are critic@@ ised by oppos@@ ers as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ic , about the tax@@ payers &apos; approach to tax@@ payers &apos; national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards could prevail . &quot;
&quot; in first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act reported the proposals made by the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; most importantly , it was intended that it should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ tim@@ ed ( SPD ) drew the plans as much progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered at the reform essential points , the Federal Environment Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel studied in spring with other European trade ministers . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n Deb@@ ate at the Le@@ aders of the Prime Minister
since its choice Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ed is expected in the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour President Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n shall appoint his debut in the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of its six questions shortly after mid@@ day and its performance by the media is likely to be examined close by the media .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly meeting .
he also said that he can ski@@ pped several meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow of the cabin and after his speech at the TU@@ C &apos;s Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour President , in silence at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the National An@@ them , was prov@@ oked by a mem@@ orandum to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , and stands at the center of several front pages @-@ wise . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to sing not the national an@@ them , has attention paid to him &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have put &quot; &quot; in respect of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he told the Labour President , the National An@@ them to sing , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns team &apos;s team , and they call upon differences in business , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliament@@ arian party originally supported him as leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acking within the Labour Market , with Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of wins . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put changes in the whole idea of a general overall .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow - and R@@ ent Minister , that the party &quot; &quot; is very clear &quot; &quot; that the party is only in charge of the governing action to lower the limit of 10,000 £ on 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the fifth Labour Chair who is David Cameron ; since he has been T@@ ory @-@ Chief over the dispute over the dispute over the dispute over the dispute over the dispute over the dispute .
&quot; the Labour President , who promised another policy approach , says he said &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the resolution of the Prime Minister is at confron@@ t@@ atively and that he is not responsible for both stroke and resistance , and instead of focusing on serious problems like poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle has been represented in the shadow - when he does not take part - for example master Cameron on the road abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues may take the word occasionally , and that he John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron want himself to &quot; remove &quot; himself from the politics of the Prime Minister &apos;s style , but a few years later he moved into it that he failed . &quot;

between May and July the earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the same period .
this percentage has been the fastest and received estim@@ ations at the time of an interest in interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar at $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was subject to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro on 1.@@ 44@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after acquisition offer of Rival AB Integr@@ ated .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ dy , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were voted in accordance with encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods at R@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest outlets made all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - would re@@ count growth again .

the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill tells that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; more buying power could mean in the pockets of potential customers .

&quot; since then there has been a gri@@ pe barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile signed the Lebanon in Munich &apos;s patent office .
in place it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the Department .
&quot; how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ y contains , Al@@ ha@@ y will therefore not betra@@ y . &quot;

met@@ cash starts Under@@ standing campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - Ein@@ diar@@ rhe@@ a
met@@ cash tried to protect Ig@@ A sc@@ arf in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a pro @-@ lasting campaign launched in order to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of an 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets , through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ makers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores samples and shop @-@ owner , the cheapest tickets for the South Australian soccer recei@@ pts loyal to customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that met@@ cash will perform further details of his defense strategy on 29 September when wholesale distributor for food , alcohol , and equipment perform at its annual investors . &quot;
there is much at stake since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ ins are generating and higher pay@@ outs as Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A retailer , which accounts for more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets some five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all existing cuts , but mainly independently independent retailer sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley showed that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million can lose sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million as long as by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this pre@@ diction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens in WA 25 in SA and 30 , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and 600 million $ in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business , and the quantities of met@@ cas@@ hs , could cost approximately 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ entrances are the most cov@@ eted . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley takes place that met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and grocery store by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , during a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely van@@ ish within a decade . met@@ cash will likely disappear . &quot;
cash refused to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food outlets , which is about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retailer , has been bi@@ ded by 43 percent since 2012 , which is equivalent to operating debt recovery at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , and invested more than 150 million $ and more than 150 million dollars to improve prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ cent in the improvement of their stores by hundreds of growing fresh foods and provide better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ cas@@ hs Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tions and charging re@@ development programs will be generated and hopes that major dealers in 2017 will return to growth in four years for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is sponsored by the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm about his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves more praise to the President of the Australian tennis courts , Steve He@@ aly rather praise as a critique of his / her own behavior . &quot;
&quot; co @-@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; which was always described as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA with the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery Quali@@ fication game in Cincinnati soon after she had to be co @-@ akis , and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated from the refer@@ ee twice , where Harrison had to hit K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I was to beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was seen last , how he struck a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a var@@ ic@@ f was stub@@ born after Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly def@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the teenage is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ att@@ um , in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic at the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am pretty much stronger , is the fact that in my opinion O@@ asi was a bit moved into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken as a but@@ cher in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et with herself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has extremely well beha@@ ved in the US @-@ Open circumstances , with Harrison , and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around you , and I think he was dealt with a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very rough 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he is not working properly with the other players , he is well trained , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature new guy , and I think he deserves to be judged after his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important case decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &apos; joint decision &apos; as the right thing for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ term solid component in the Team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is focusing completely on the competition , rather than all the controversy ro@@ un@@ dish &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick felt very quickly the ascent , which he gets rid of , but to make him understand the consequences of his actions . he &apos;s going to be aware of it , and he &apos;s best for the team , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; European refugee crisis : Hungary explains , concludes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the public lasting and ri@@ eg@@ ated the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all firm who tried to move illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed on the limit , as hundreds of migrants were killed in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land of accum@@ ul@@ ating and Serbian officials with re@@ pri@@ mor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the people who had escaped from violence , burned down a land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents , and were buried there . &quot;
but fruit rose up .
&quot; as a police @-@ helicopter on them , consecr@@ ated the migrants &quot; Public to see the limit ! &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ en insul@@ ts against Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some reported from protest food and water .
&quot; Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister , stated that &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; migrants would be sent back to Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral of col@@ lateral .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were re@@ alis@@ able in over@@ l@@ apping Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that in the final month or by the end of the year - an agreement would prove that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to take a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not focus on an early action between Brussels or her neighbors .
&quot; the emergency ran@@ ged on Tuesday in two southern regions gave more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could accelerate streets and asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said , that his country also made the construction of an bar@@ bed @-@ dra@@ h@@ tz@@ es along his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after there was a fence at the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ers in the competitions start to create the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in the past few months , Hungary has become a significant Eng@@ pass from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for a significant Eng@@ or and an entry point into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , ins@@ isted that most incoming economic migrants are based on seeking a better life , and not war @-@ populations , which have the claim to protection , a view that leads strongly in contradiction to other EU states , among them , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws conducted by midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall , leaving the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay pen@@ alties for do@@ cking persons . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explained the emergency , &quot; said government agencies Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military still , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border an armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already viewed . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 other were already penetr@@ ated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damage to the fence , they are now har@@ med into police actions , and are accused of criminal off@@ ences to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are making the fence quick to fix .
&quot; Hungarian officials made two of the seven Grenz@@ en@@ ades with Serbia , after crossing a train @-@ wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed @-@ dra@@ kes to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people , and thrust out a number of people to get involved there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to come in , but thousands stopped outside . &quot;
another group of migrants was blocking the most important highway of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .

&quot; Clinton has now backed 47 percent of democratic voters among the elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not told the Presidential regime , receives support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters tell that their opinion is fixed , what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ ics supporters are more constant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ news survey Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups , while in addition some gains generated . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great competitive edge of women and moder@@ ates , but these signs have been reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support for the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is only able to return here with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ics benefit in democratic voters under the age of 50 has become fle@@ eting , and they and His are now at the same level . &quot;
Clinton is still a big advantage in the older voters .
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ way lead with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives have been saying they would support with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some Provi@@ dence , as well as 15 percent , they would only support because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger at those who currently did not support Clinton at the present time - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; during 48 percent of democratic voters of the elections say that Clinton is supporting Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters this over their leading edge , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ tons suppor@@ ter are asked in an open question why , she &apos;s the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time , that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
from Clin@@ tons supporters also will also mention its association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and the voters are also being quoted .
&quot; since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office to the exam , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the elections , who would be the second choice for the Party , is Bi@@ den at the forefront . &quot;
&quot; von Clin@@ ics followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decision decides not to nom@@ inate the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons lead up before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bees on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate for the best opportunities to win the vote ; however , this number dropped from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; beer is a second with this measurement , but the percentage which sees it as the &quot; re @-@ bar@@ est , &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , democr@@ at voters call questions about the voters . &quot;
&quot; much like last month , no single democr@@ at candidate or potentially eller candidate for these voters of the term as unacceptable are not acceptable . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics , for voters of the elections of their party . &quot;
&quot; ambig@@ u@@ ities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ds , as honest and trustworthy , and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; the bi@@ ds cuts to the three candidates at the best of honesty , while Clin@@ ics &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton be honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 % ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
around all this measurements a quarter of democratic voters do not think of S@@ anders about a quarter of the democratic voters .
&quot; since questions about Hill@@ ary &apos;s life will be submitted to Hill@@ ary &apos;s use of an individual e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their statement while only about a third is satisfied .
&quot; the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem was coming to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans told that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no effect on her general opinions by Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mostly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy it is still considered to be a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for a honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the voting equity far beyond the constitu@@ encies considered to be honest and cannot be trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes at leadership .
&quot; of the six older candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority looks more like honest , but like Car@@ son , many of them have no opinion of him . &quot;
the fault rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters among the elections is 6 percent@@ ages .
Ben Car@@ son moves to b@@ ump in national survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; in the last two candidates half of the support of the voters in the new survey has lost , and others lose hold of support . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in great number . the support is growing by 23 % in the last convertible survey conducted in front of Fox News Deb@@ ates last month to 27 % in survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sh@@ aded in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received at demographic groups and tr@@ ump into Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ himself , is defeated with Wis@@ dom into the Governor Scott Walker , fallen at the deepest , and in this last month , due to 10 % support last month . &quot;
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush and former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are up to 6 % in the third place .
the fault mar@@ ge in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c pol@@ l announced last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the pol@@ ls - he resi@@ des in 19 % support at the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one of the last week , Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump some side @-@ si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son used to be apologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ umps faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump am last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only at distance , reaches for bath@@ ers already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bathroom in North or Baltic is likely to be a nice pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some things do not go into the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; the Mediterranean temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East , it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degree , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes down to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood to be charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; nearly two years , after a student during a student ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder will be filed against five people . &quot;
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g took a brutal attack in September 2013 and hesit@@ ated to hospital the police in September 2013 .
&quot; officials had said , he had been tam@@ pered with a thirty @-@ pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained finally about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI Brotherhood do not sm@@ ack the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g is power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; they had however the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , its symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , told Poli@@ ti@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members began to hide their banks and set the good of the Brotherhood basically about the Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Political referred to . &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning to his wounds .
&quot; after an auto@@ cr@@ in@@ report , Den@@ g repeated a mu@@ te power inj@@ ector injury to the head , torso and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ ites of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year to the ship , &quot; &quot; Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ h family represents , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step of public authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members because of the third gra@@ der for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with prophets and education of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make the persons responsible for the people , but if there is an organization who has - officially or in@@ officially - also sanc@@ tioned it , we will also call them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a inser@@ tion increase comes , and the house will end up destroying , ren@@ ding ren@@ ders will rise , and the economy will deri@@ ve into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long that it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the story for the economy offers only a low guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve to lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; as representatives of the U.S. central bank have given rise to that investors do not really focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
in fact multiple variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants however state that the whole excitement of an inser@@ tion was possibly exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is to be interpreted as a signal for the end of an era of &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Economics at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at low level , in order to se@@ is@@ mic Scho@@ ck , to guide the many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical trend based on historical trends just how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the acceptance of inser@@ ts can make things volati@@ le for a while volati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is hit , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that governments might reflect 12 to 24 months after the first increase again , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens to Z@@ inser@@ ters of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is now predicted in the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the path to the inser@@ tion , fairly flat in the last six days according to an analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chef system @-@ strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares in height rate will appear later during the increases cycle and the return on the return with it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but Z@@ inser@@ ts promote it often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
&quot; extremely remark@@ ably , is that GDP &apos;s GDP near his lowest point will be at a permit increase by F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank in 118 Z@@ inser@@ tions , amoun@@ ted to 118 contrac@@ tions since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent in 2015 , only few that this will last , and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ts resulting in such a frag@@ mentary economical backdrop could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants expressed the whole year on a lowering of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading could only be a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all earnings from 1950 to this date have been expanded throughout in a super @-@ cycle with increasing the momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in the watched phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been awaiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this was so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also volati@@ le , since the market increases an inser@@ tion and the pattern is rather similar as it is on the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect at bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
&quot; by bonds , the ren@@ unciation appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle is occurring . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the height cycle , the accum@@ ul@@ ators fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
the strateg@@ ists from Charles sw@@ ab believe that the increase at the interest rates will result in bringing Ren@@ ov@@ ens closer between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ uation of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ ver@@ z@@ ins@@ ular bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; we are still careful , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st for pigs , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , means Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations already . &quot;
&quot; aside from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the Er@@ ur@@ sk@@ ve is fl@@ atter , l@@ apping has increased and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; moreover , companies that benefit the larger share of their operations in the United States will benefit from , if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are worse , as an rising of dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond very positive , three months after an initial company with an initial performance , said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with asser@@ ted balance sheet according to each of the inser@@ ts expands in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; company with high capital ren@@ ders and low volati@@ lity in its shares , their counterparts are also covered with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
it is also benef@@ iting that consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising dollars as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; austerity could see profits through higher yields , even though experts are different opinions about how fast they are going to take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender on account of his &quot; defence
he ar@@ gues that it is not to be distinguished by commercial ri@@ vals .
he also studied at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just the Br@@ its im@@ it@@ ated
&quot; parliament Col@@ lins Dam@@ ien attacked the mission to The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , holding a leader in member , and increases new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private ters . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly cannot be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 does seem - I don &apos;t want to use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also zi@@ pped at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples of which you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn any differently about classical music anywhere . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is un@@ matched .
&quot; and on the engagement of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I also think , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that the audience would be harder to get involved in the audience , when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , the media and sport on fire were used to step up the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ ien @-@ members Dam@@ ien @-@ MP Dam@@ ien , attacked The Voice to - the musical talent @-@ show of the BBC , bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for valued at 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see , why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall ins@@ isted that BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; had a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a &quot; &quot; entertainment series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , he refused to exclude the order of other series by The Voice in the future or giving money for other sub @-@ paying formats for other sub @-@ quality formats . &quot;
&quot; Internet re@@ posit@@ ors went up in August at the slo@@ west and Black Friday , can be responsible for it &quot;
seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
last month the lowest result existed since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
online sales increase 3 years ago through the use of mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November broke out the issues
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping is curved , and many of the world &apos;s main shopping streets were transformed in gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; but experts say that there are now signs that the online turnover is stag@@ nat@@ ing , after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be seeing that new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , Andy has developed &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , &quot; editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ Governance system . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales started three years ago , as a buyer , starting with their mobile phones . &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as home on the sofa .
&quot; but now this is com@@ mu@@ te , and we may experience that growth decreases . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a cause of revenues of revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyer will hold their purchases before this event , which is held on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers websites . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which buyers could hold off on bar@@ gain , buyers of whether or not to stop shopping . &quot;
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Consor@@ tium found out of just 5 £ spending a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are carried out via web shops . &quot;
at the same time buy more than one quarter of people clothing and shoes online instead of living in the inner city .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is about
&quot; British to employ increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen in Eastern Europe has increased behind
&quot; this leads to some 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at arti@@ sans , &quot;
&quot; at the same time , king@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales departments are far @-@ reaching by King@@ fis@@ her : &quot;
&quot; von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is said that British to carry out their j@@ amm@@ ers and brush for the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans , who put work in their homes and put them down in place . &quot;
&quot; if you are skill@@ ful to deal with a hammer or a brush to stra@@ it from walls , you seem to have to become a minority . &quot;
&quot; because British will employ increasingly arti@@ sans to perform pet jobs in their homes , thus the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Véronique Lau@@ ry , new business@@ man from King@@ fis@@ her , who possesses building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , had the services to offer ni@@ gh in the meantime outdated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are directed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to spend more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are met in the shop . &quot;
&quot; in the moment , the men are weighing . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , showing more than female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; It is still working a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
we have to de@@ duce this more towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women attended the leading company in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , also represented their top team to reflect on a equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied precisely 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial status . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for the board of directors .
King@@ fis@@ her mel@@ ted a decline in half @-@ year &apos;s profit and the transfer after the Group ow@@ es the costs of the shut@@ down of the stores .

at the Landes@@ Court Kla@@ gen@@ furt am Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vi@@ em@@ e@@ isters A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and collection inter@@ rog@@ ation .
the accused has not known himself guilty .
one of them was charged with abuse of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of the accus@@ ation in May of law .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the pre @-@ state attorney , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ investigations that accused persons used in 2006 to 2011 was disp@@ osed of by club accounts , which they disp@@ osed into their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damages he had with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sport function@@ aries are also charged due to financial regimes .
&quot; this fact exp@@ ired , by the chairman of the Scot@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; as a pro@@ li@@ ment of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence show that at no time the association was an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports@@ men have only been applied for transform@@ ers and campa@@ igning for it from 1982 to 2011 and carried out the sport club during which they carried out a lot of time and money in 2001 - the Pas@@ va amoun@@ ted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( about 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were standing before the situation : do we go on or block the club , &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in Br@@ ot@@ al bulk soli@@ ds of the financial institution . &quot;
he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants who then decided to take this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have called money all the way our life insurance as security goes in the bank , &quot; he said upon the withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed with the association , you can freely manage the money , it must not be taken any debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , furthermore , - in case of the financial - success the payout of the conversion is retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one gained a part of the allowance , which was only years later , since 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account , it was paid . &quot;
&quot; therefore also seemed like a package and not detailed checked reviews , explained the ex @-@ owner explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and austerity books initiated the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot;
why the non @-@ payments were not revealed in detail in detail the judge asked the judge .
&quot; the association did not interest themselves in detail for financial hard@@ ship , importantly the answer would be , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; once in 2011 against the full investig@@ ations for abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; that had been returned , the accused said . &quot;
&quot; this securities account was carried out on the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to whose statement the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; wanted the judge in know . &quot;
I did not know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have wanted anything about this money , the pro@@ secutor placed in the room . &quot;
&quot; the compl@@ ained may have been informed , right @-@ made of the function@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage done ? . wanted judgment and pro@@ secutor to know .
&quot; then said the first accused , would not be in agreement with this formulation , because the association has never taken any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent salary , he made only o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; on diet , he added to the Club 1,000 euros a month but the actual expense was much higher , he added . &quot;
detailed documents for the early years could not pre@@ tend to the accused .
&quot; these were made correctly according to an operation , in which everything had been assessed as correctly , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second accused .
&quot; all the fac@@ tions are in cash , and by his residence he had to go to the bank to meet in his residence , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard sets other 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition for three years of ongoing recruitment , the computer res@@ ese will be disman@@ tled in cash at the re@@ charge of the company . &quot;
the parking lot of the US @-@ computer box He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) find no end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , US @-@ technology plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its corporate customer space . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the company will be saved to the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.@@ 4 billion ) , the company divided on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion , which will attack the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; for the current three years of cutting @-@ edge 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; HP was employed at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year 2013 / 14 , including around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; after all , the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ shares gave 2.3 percent after . &quot;
the LA@@ P made by the Califor@@ ni@@ an Pal@@ o Alto is currently referring to : so the computer and printer business is still bund@@ led in a new society - separately from the other @-@ key areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both divisions are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; once again , a again disappointing PC @-@ paragraph , as well as a weaker demand from corporate clients , set the second @-@ largest PC @-@ manufacturer according to Len@@ ovo worldwide . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and printing went back by 1 @-@ 1.5 percent in the third quarter of July . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP answers a split and massive parking lot on changes in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and do more and more businesses have done online . &quot;
&quot; Whit@@ mans restructuring plans will see the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs in total . &quot;
conflicts : a majority supports the anti @-@ IS mission mission
but a direct involvement of German soldiers at combat operations in Iraq would have overwhel@@ m@@ ingly hit against rejection by : 54 per cent against it - 35 per cent were agreed .
&quot; all other states fly against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive . &quot;

the decision on interest rates on interest rates for the States bank
&quot; the world observed the world when the U.S. exp@@ o falls on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time nearly a decade or not , interest in interest has been raised . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists were asked by Re@@ uters , found that F@@ ed was going to do this , now the F@@ ed will continue to persist a little longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest has taken to N@@ UL@@ L . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly leave the zero @-@ range and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generating only a small inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook over a global scale . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets , to stop on a raise , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be issued on Thursday at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death sc@@ orer from the Delta State University sent ap@@ ologies for apologi@@ zing
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later turned on his colleagues and killed him , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he could make him &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; on the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities out on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that said , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he had shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; he said the Staff of Not@@ ice , that the police had to send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I poured my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in house , but he &quot; no man dis@@ rupt &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he didn &apos;t give it to him . &quot;
represented was not a statement for his shots .
&quot; when police officers came to the scene , she found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of represented , 45 , which said , &quot; I &apos;m doing so sorry ; I could go back . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after the letter of the note , 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he was his / ane Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before his own life on Monday night when poli@@ cem@@ an took place at poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; university &apos;s former president William La@@ For@@ ge , he know nothing of a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , it was supposed to have believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said NO on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence of a &quot; three @-@ ec@@ ks@@ relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was taken by Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en , who told she was married about seven years as a &quot; good human being . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were gone out 15 years ago , but they stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; Ste@@ en said , he and pro@@ re@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and would be destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss have got her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; p@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ inde@@ ss possessed a dog named Light@@ ning to met for about three years now .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; the police said , he discovered relatives at some point in time to say to them , &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; as the poli@@ c@@ emen set him up on Highway 1 close to Green@@ ville later in that night , his car fled to the side , fled to toe , ran into the woods and kill themselves with a shot . &quot;
&quot; represented in the spring of 2015 , by the Delta State University , he received a doctoral title , as his CV &apos;s website at the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that have lost their happiness
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 it was tried because of drug ownership . &quot;
all of this is for sure its toll .
Euro@@ drawings : Lufthansa is built on the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big group of companies .
&quot; in the year a half billion euros per year , the Lufthansa group wants to save alone with a better organization . &quot;
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 managers will cost the work of the workplace .
&quot; in the program , there is the new negotiation with the pilot trade union . &quot;
the Lufthansa is based on their organizational structure and adds value to the Euro@@ cou@@ ter Euro@@ drawing .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit fee of about EUR 500 million a year out of cost - and redemption , shared the airline by Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa no longer exists in Lufthansa from the Lufthansa in the book . &quot;
the Bil@@ lig@@ ently Euro@@ drawing is that such as possible is developed as independently as possible .
in the team of Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr future Karl Ulrich Sh@@ adt will be responsible for the Euro@@ drawing .
&quot; with the new exhibition highlights Spo@@ hr the importance of Euro@@ Millions , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was of a strong company . &quot;
&quot; under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , the airlines included three quarters of the annual sales of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot @-@ association cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) , the negotiations are scheduled to be resum@@ ed after the suspended strike on this Thursday . &quot;
this shared the union .
the issue of discussions is supposed to be the retirement law firm for pilots .
cock@@ pit wool in one year with a predicted re@@ set result &quot; as soon as possible to portable results .
the conflict between the trade union and the air@@ line led to various strikes .
&quot; the background is next to the &quot; &quot; Transi@@ tional concept &quot; &quot; of Wings . &quot;
it looks that Lufthansa is lag@@ ging in the fight against competitors routes to the Group &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ gl@@ ie Euro@@ drawings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly periods for double frac@@ tion@@ ists
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League @-@ defeat from Manchester to PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
&quot; while doing the left external def@@ ender to tears and will exclude him from playing at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope not that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w had broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field of playing and needed oxygen before being put to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double construction and is located in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; it will then be moved to tomorrow or perhaps one day later , and then operates in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then , plays fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have double problems then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red card , and to escape the war@@ p of a fur . &quot;
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli who arbitr@@ ates the refer@@ ee has not pen@@ ed the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had disappeared .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how cap@@ sul@@ ate I am , my path to recovery now , I &apos;ll come back stronger again . &quot;
&quot; related here : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w , in the defeat at the PS@@ V . &quot;
the German @-@ defence in France has added an extra incentive for the European Championship in France to recover as far as coming June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very terrible injury . &quot;
if a player leaving the place with this sort of injury all is very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg of leg from Mexico against Van Ga@@ als The Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you heard that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
it was impossible for me to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball who had moved to another direction , so it seemed that he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how hard this can be something .
I feel very badly there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also taken to hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ der from Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that will learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost completely . &quot;
&quot; unless , you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who published 1971 @-@ on environmental cl@@ am@@ ble by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , she writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &apos; funny , moving , creative , and having a powerful message , it is a book I enjoy reading my children , because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except the subsequent paragraph - in which Cameron alleged the action of the book , says instead a content of the film version of 2012 re @-@ returns the new characters and details added to the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes to see a real tree by Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , his real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss , and the 1991 died , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that were not yet adequately enough : the text seemed to be present on the website of the Lor@@ ax film , which is produced on the Internet site Th@@ need @-@ Ville , which is produced on the Internet site Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its an prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of the book so little trust . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment goes so little familiar by the wh@@ ist@@ ens@@ ity Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , snow @-@ coloured , &quot; &quot; that speaks on behalf of trees &quot; , &quot; devast@@ ated . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR job was adapted to a hel@@ per when the Lor@@ ax has not read a child in a child for 20 times .
a down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ person said the lyrics would probably have come from Camer@@ ons electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons employees , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion of England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to come across to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you select the cad@@ res the England has chosen the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not shut an ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ looks site is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing structure , and the common spirit is strong ; they will not bear the scars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size on test layer , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; according to this message : Adam ly@@ th fl@@ aps up from the England test ca@@ der , and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to be made up of Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ ana is oriented on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he will hopefully come out further for Yor@@ k@@ shire , a further chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England &apos;s coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t get so good benefits , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test perc@@ mann will receive to expose his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven odds - as Sam Rob@@ son got before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine was in place .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to get home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England was first suspended Jonathan S@@ mol@@ t in the Caribbean -- but this lost opportunity now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales are coming in and he is a drummer whom I highly estimate .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ Player of what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge space that met us very much .
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those received before him , but of course this depends on the team of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , Mo@@ een alongside Cook beat , which would perform an extra @-@ spin dish and four Qui@@ cks would be given up , and I have nothing on it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a drummer cannot beat there and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ erl of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he entered 2001 as Open@@ er .
he has done three hundred R@@ us right away and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited use with him he was very impressed to me as a young man .
&quot; people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and thinking , it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there &apos;s no large number of backup @-@ cl@@ ots that rise up their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions in the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Carolina awar@@ ding , the messenger from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the testing game could be a Master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring an abundance of experience since it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is designed for the international Cri@@ cket contest , as players or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind , even if the news are in line with the previously predicted . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for one @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team @-@ performers will not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as to players will depend on their jobs .
such decisions will not be taken very easily .
Bre@@ xit &apos;s Bre@@ xit &apos;s Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = A@@ void of Great Britain from the EU ) could benefit from an allowance if the economy up to 2017 is in a lu@@ te device
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s uncertain line @-@ up strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the brilliant Jer@@ emy &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour or TU@@ C who fought for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European Diplom@@ atic , said that some member states , so deeply rooted in various crises , as the EU is now and not always taken out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self settled agenda with se@@ greg@@ ated breeding events and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they mostly not want to be filled . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that it does not like it , endangering social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies gain for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes an outside UK inside the EU tent , &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and makes us feel that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials come to a point where they are no matter whether we stay or going . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s careful chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is one ally , but she has left the office for 10 years before it looks bad for her to look bad for her , as he did for the long periods like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ur@@ ant force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left wing . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine that they are getting off a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent the energy from becoming the Bl@@ f@@ ie British to prevent the energy from Scotland &apos;s resignation from the UK - something which they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have to be used .
&quot; therefore may be planning some such ministers even inten@@ tionally not helpful notes , completely at the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s post office campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , it susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; has won nothing of its value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how r@@ umin@@ ni@@ cally the Fle@@ et Street is at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics become the oligarchy of the press @-@ bar@@ one , as they did not support our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember him weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ ban@@ anas ban@@ anas &quot; ban@@ anas in the early 90 &apos;s years . &quot;
&quot; with all his madness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this was part of the med@@ ley of a tax @-@ feared s@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ enden foreigners and the pseudo @-@ cases which most of our major newspapers were . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair is similar to her , but determined that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you sit down better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of getting lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ er than Blair itself , as he questioned Cameron &apos;s refer@@ ee , for Blair had put the principle on the un@@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , who opened him a back@@ door door . &quot;
the press has never drawn him up .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me to waste time - seems to repeat Kin@@ no@@ cks Mur@@ however &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ s , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it can take it , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I want to put it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ti@@ ps traditional mart@@ yrs tendency and the wild their ge@@ o @-@ filters from Tor@@ s@@ Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ly can probably say any to it yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , &quot; but no ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week said , that Cor@@ by@@ s@@ nell John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as the shadow of Hitler was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s , when his old father emigr@@ ated to his labour cabinet , without going to far too far and lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , to remain &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Ben@@ ns , was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , as J@@ C said his Mit@@ stre@@ ites , and Members , after all reports on their class day at Mont@@ ag@@ Day . &quot;
whatever wants to convey the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV round the clock and above all in the ma@@ el@@ strom of Social Media , a brood @-@ place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no open map for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ our@@ y support in the record campaign for self @-@ determination , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think safe so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity to the EU membership - in line with its ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ ulation economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm of the small difference is a fundamental principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; like with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home for their supervis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin political capital are wast@@ ing , - they have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be useless ? &quot;
&quot; the US has already been rather disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government &apos;s power , which at the start of the Monday I was reminded of something of British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
critic@@ ise report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking made from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by writing the evidence presented by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; p@@ he published the &quot; &quot; primary report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; two further researchers are writing in BM@@ J , and have asked whether or not to build the claims on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public is expected to claim that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the post@@ ures and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons that were conven@@ ed to lead a model for a multi@@ disciplinary criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions about the damages of various nicotine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that the meeting of the meeting a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health was to have obtained the manager previously by British American Tob@@ acco tool ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to the public health in a sustainability report , told her . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting means to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the body &apos;s members are not delivered , but these include several known e @-@ cigarettes winners , some of which are also a product funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
tobacco was also participating in the session between the tobacco and the tobacco .
&quot; it follows that the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard proof of most products &quot; in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ endant report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told the asser@@ tion of p@@ he that &quot; no evidence indicates that e @-@ cigarettes could be used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being with sweet , said the claims of BM@@ J had previously responded to . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking .
every second life di@@ ver dies down at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that health risks from e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to it , but that we continue to study the long term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has expressed the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence remains and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0.000 people annually die of an illness with regard to smoking , and smoking the national health system costs two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear precautions that e @-@ cigarettes are not without any risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give East@@ ere , says a former chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop playing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival@@ als would give &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ cast@@ ed fee should only be used to make the type of programs that can not be sent by other UK transm@@ itter .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are likely to place publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to place in harsh times against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor , Tony Hall , said that the company was to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson , that he tried to get in touch with Channel 4 for six years , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve got problems with the idea that BBC programs would be commissioned or sends , which were also clearly shown by not sub@@ ven@@ tion@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ cast@@ ed fee , what I don &apos;t need to stop for a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least give your production to programs that others do not have or give to the order . &quot;
&quot; you send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach as wide support for their future as possible . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it &apos;s nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive control programmes financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , yet put it in both own productions . &quot;
honestly other channels would give their right arm to them .
I am trying to see how this is public @-@ right TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business for series , which led the BBC 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC should work for the hunt for reviews because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on top of the BBC shows that again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , which was supposed to sell the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal sound programs should not compete to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one does not measure their tasks , and they can argue about if they were performing their sacred missions to justify the justification of 4 billion £ round , &quot; well , of course , we have created all of these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them into a window window , in which no one they ever wanted to see . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the broad@@ casting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of you think we &apos;ve got a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who want a lot of money for 150 pounds , ask whether this is true , because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to form , and maintain . &quot;
he said that very few of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said there was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should take a look at the public @-@ law television broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada - and they should take a look in &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that just a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make all available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Wr@@ ite can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified neur@@ ons which can be controlled by bro@@ kers of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they come with sound impulses , which have high frequencies for human hearing , in order to be heard . &quot;
impulses are working through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells which are amended genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ ound @-@ waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers say the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ ue , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day the depths of the brain @-@ brain stimulation could have appeared , an electrical impulse in the brain of men to treat the symptoms of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ ament@@ ous acts usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani made it clear that they had it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves that enter the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the enhanced ultras@@ ound waves work on the structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and in the membran@@ es found by some of the spice cells .
&quot; the sound waves bring the opening of these icon channels , and activate the cells to which they are assigned to , as a report on Nature Communications . &quot;
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ ds the wor@@ ms @-@ controlled Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of its mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als do carry .
&quot; when he turns ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they switch the changed Mot@@ on@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ sh , a groundbreaking tool , the scientist allows , neur@@ ons with impulse of light and turn on . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Get could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that must be sent to a op@@ tic fiber to the desired place in the brain , low rate ultras@@ ound tissue can pass urine and can be sent to the brain from the top to the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make an temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications can concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ in @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight Golden Rules for Life in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , but only at this time I still remember the tense smile that I was anxious - and on the numerous , long @-@ lasting discomfort regarding others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot;
the ind@@ w@@ elling in the dormit@@ ory is sufficient from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ous to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chi@@ cks : people tell where you come , whether and where you choose the Sab@@ bat@@ ter , where you come in terms of cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just an he@@ y@@ var@@ kt Ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others who do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acted the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you might not speak if your lashes was pushed into fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meet points , but they are also the places where people get on and put their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; below : do not remember to capture a relationship with a relationship , &quot;
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted is given a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ space @-@ space @-@ culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this may be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows to tell you , &quot; I like you , and I will , that our friendship goes on , but you have to go away that I have used the energy for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a class@@ mates is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it to him a text message instead .
apro@@ pos si@@ eve : do it .
a guy living in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an invitation was not fir@@ mer door an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start at the height of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie at the height of the back @-@ player , it is dro@@ pping in the doors of 1950 to present themselves with a dish of 1950 ni@@ es , less than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
their room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain and become at the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise associate .
&quot; of course , it depends if you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
bad mixed cl@@ umps from flour , sugar and fat carry out that people can sleep up if you drop .
food to ste@@ al is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea as well ? &quot;
check that with the property owner .
&quot; the chances are good , they say to work themselves , even if they cook within , . &quot;
&quot; when someone is missing your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - however , try to deal with that well @-@ balanced deal as my room@@ mate , which sustain@@ s their milk to pun@@ ish Die@@ b . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise control of people from their sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a continual person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b which are in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it makes them something , drum &amp; bass little qui@@ eter to place , as it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
you reacted to it with still fresh music .
&quot; when they ended up at 5 am , she had to sleep two hours before she died , leaving her own music , closed her door and ended up with her three @-@ hour testing . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be cr@@ ammed and turned out to be a room@@ mate for your future marriage holding in her , re @-@ det@@ ach , and then see them everyday and perhaps see how she draws together all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course the heart goes his own ways - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage , try to talk a little bit of reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment that you notice that someone has the key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary is between an ultim@@ and bullying , when it seems . &quot;
a good stre@@ ak is fun but it only takes moments until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give you by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but neglect never anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water that you then put in the freezer - but push its possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , all@@ ein@@ gs , Ger@@ ing@@ thi@@ ener , &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner builds in the mid@@ que Eck@@ ental Valley terr@@ aced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; therefore , approximately for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only mother and the ear@@ ing@@ thi@@ est . &quot;
&quot; I show how to still build cheap and well still today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur of Markus Gil@@ dner thinks to know how quickly cheaper spaces can be created : it builds in a project terr@@ aced for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the apartment market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass Det@@ ectors in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
because people remain to be a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee flow , we do have a sufficient living room in the next few decades . &quot;
&quot; a unique , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when one puts people in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses built exactly in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each asylum . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a sitting room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be modified according to the particular needs . &quot;
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters living space per house rises to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took lasted .
this is reasonable .
have the components to be complicated to their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : building @-@ legally I carried out my project correctly .
especially difficult it makes the elevated dam @-@ worth special construction and the actu@@ ator regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants of their town@@ house reacted to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were what , they have thrown me , super@@ structures for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but do not ti@@ ghten the competitive fight in affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true yet : we have had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built luxury homes , which can hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
not only refugees but also the only mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ner alone .
I show how to still be cheap and well built today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by typing in to the setting @-@ up app , to type in &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install . &quot;
&quot; some are encountered after the installation on problems , as they receive an error that the &quot; &quot; software upgrade &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
&quot; to deal with the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has more likely to do so through the anticip@@ ation of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth seeing that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a loader , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not allow the update continued , as the phone may switch between half way and result in a break @-@ out of the updates . &quot;

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ center Anton@@ isti@@ ft have been together under the clo@@ el of the social foundation and opened a new position at the Count of St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consultations it is possible to participate in courses also .
the social @-@ foundation takes it down from the mountain to the city center .
&quot; more specifically , to the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot;
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office was recently opened .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive seniors and advice information on issues such as patient insurance or care for health care or nursing care . &quot;
&quot; for years now , we have been firmly established with our out@@ patient care service , that often care members will be left alone . &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; no rarely many benefits of the K@@ assen cannot be avail@@ ed in , because the complexity of the insurance is hardly ever understood , &quot; explained the new households in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , which is responsible for the Anton@@ on@@ st Council , as well as for the celebrations , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultation , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office offers also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
so the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as saddle , memory training , or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior staff and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , screening and Reh@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the seniors and care centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; Eva Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , chair@@ manship of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office in the city center will see both business leaders especially in demographic change .
&quot; after this , such a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure is essential in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wolfgang Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the age of the inauguration ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ &apos;s office im@@ par@@ ate himself at the age : &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able presence . &quot;

males t@@ aps on 17 @-@ year Afgh@@ ans a
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were travelling at foot from Bad So@@ den to go on road . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 years of old Afgh@@ ans , followed by the police for his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the B@@ FT @-@ Gas station .
there were also three persons in the area of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried out the youth up to now , and stroke this with the fist into the face . &quot;
&quot; the victims suffered a nose @-@ away , and ble@@ w heavily out of the nose . &quot;
&quot; when his two friends brought about ha@@ zy and compl@@ aining about the bat , he first ordered by his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the last young man was now brought home .
the perpetrators followed the group with a vehicle up to their apartment and was introduced several times a lot over there .
&quot; when one does not saw the vehicle more , the last one went before the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there he was again attacked by the bat , and another male person . &quot;
taking a sn@@ ap of a stroke can be checked onto the face and the sunset of the victim .
the last had to be brought to hospital for medical care in a hospital .
so far only a v@@ ague description is ahead of .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
&quot; the second guy is to have been approximately 1,@@ 65 meters in size and was dressed with an je@@ ans , and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice of field and invested € 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ chers .
&quot; also , Sam@@ t@@ collaborative masters Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the contrary , have luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller led to the practice of Fel@@ ting ausen on the 1st of October . &quot;
&quot; during UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen in retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing by his successor in the next months with half a site . &quot;
&quot; after a transformation phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros on the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the rock @-@ ups were born years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently took their professional medical education at the Ver@@ dener hospital and commented on the practical orientation of the year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into these practices , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and battle . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller found the idea in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf that put its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years .
he as an advantage see his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the Mü@@ llers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; here the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
currently he is working as a captain servant in Sul@@ ingen . he was also engaged in dialogue at the dialogue of dialogue in 2009 and is engaged in the DR@@ K readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen in 2009 .
&quot; from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ low@@ ausen as a medical specialist , his wife has specialised in UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) to Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to be registered as a household . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term loading and load @-@ EK@@ GS as well as need a consultation room more .
&quot; furthermore , the E@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , the Mü@@ llers are obtained within the framework of a conveyor programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; stressed Sam@@ t@@ Commun@@ to@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients are reported according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , each quarter in the practice of Fel@@ lowship , in North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lowship ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; he also visits a visit to who &apos;s in @-@ house consultations , continues to be seen especially in familiar faces : taking over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of ri@@ f@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with their departure end in A@@ sen@@ dorf termin@@ ated an era , after all the medicine is practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; remember UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness wo@@ e them after the long time .
&quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will surely still see , &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; you add to her husband &quot; &quot; We have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pressed myself down to gardening , now this could be any other way . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple of two grandchildren and travels gladly . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we can leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also driven at our border line , &quot; said Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; still , however , that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can , also &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people are at the forefront here .
&quot; however , it is clear that it would need distinct signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
people must know that we do not accept infinite migration flows even not about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is denied &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia government had to travel towards Austria and Germany to travel both to Slovenia and under circumstances also cor@@ ridors for refugees .
but this was not so the home of the El@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . however .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors be &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia rather becomes the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled . &quot;
&quot; like the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ in that its limits to refugees would not be able to enter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must render its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government , the first refugees needed to travel on Tuesday in the night time , from East Croatian to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to ste@@ er the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could take them up in the nearby ma@@ is@@ fields .
&quot; since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meet a police order with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mostly about Syrians and Afgh@@ an , including numerous women and children . &quot;
even b@@ ail@@ out services and the Red Cross be already in action .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country with some 4000 refugees said , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses made from Pres@@ evo on the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had hitherto brought to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade however , however , appears that people should attack specific routes : &quot; neither we can nor do we want to do it , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports in the morning , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian city of Si@@ d , during the day , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the in@@ mates were gone on travelling all night from the 500 kilometres , along the border with Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said we must go here &quot; , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
thus it could actually come to the west part of the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities of cross @-@ border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had stated that his country has prepared corresponding plans for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees for potential applications . &quot;
&quot; for details , he not called him , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; have extensive possibilities to border control . &quot;
there are strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has since 2007 been one of the following a positive witness to the EU partner since 2007 , as a result of the standard of border controls since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; on a Serbian page , they continue to stick behind the Hungarian border fence , by about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ os that led after R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border passes of Hor@@ os and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g continues to be fully locked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local presence in Hor@@ ends : he kept the debates about ageing routes by refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it is not at present not to be very high productive pay .
one could not say if they would continue their trip via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
accessory rates migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to introduce to the refugees country cards where alternative routes from Croatia are incorporated . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ers was sent in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed at last year &apos;s outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports betrayed results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant concentrated his profit on a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ xing service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning , about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday at present . &quot;
&quot; at this point in the last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share was over 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a prize of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year to earn 20 cent less than in the previous forecast .
analysts anticipated according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view is likely to become effective despite the price increases , an average of 4.0 percent , and on 4 January effective , despite higher access for bo@@ vines from heavy and large par@@ c@@ els collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it still expected the result of the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid yields , if one takes the weaker economic conditions than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment have been announced one day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans to stop 9@@ 0.000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; during the quarter , which ended on August 31st , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million served , six percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research recorded analysts . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six out of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected 12,@@ 23 billion dollars .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has noted the last years in the last years a decline in international pri@@ me@@ val shipping while initi@@ ating sales in its unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales increased at the bo@@ oting of 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
the Express @-@ unit recognized higher revenue due to higher prices while the result declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ ex shares amoun@@ ting to 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;

&quot; warning above them at one end of the wounded , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat sa@@ wing , is a mur@@ derer from the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has held a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US @-@ employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged it was a failed third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , as long as the U.S. economy is ready to become extinct from unprecedented incentive since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data on the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence in global financial markets make the already cautious F@@ ed Representative to intensify this volati@@ lity , due to the lifting of the ram@@ part to federal markets , and whether it is also one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; clearly , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ Company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , the interest rate does not increase , the increased uncertainty around the global market will continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what the financial market secur@@ es itself in itself .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been interviewed by Bloomberg , an inser@@ tion increase this week predicted . &quot;
&quot; however the financial markets expect a waiting by the F@@ ed , with a key indication that shows only a 30 % chance on an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline of the stock market in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the str@@ ate@@ es hit the blow , it promises that another increasing is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average score at 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the campaign was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains a sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief of Chief Research at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when she does , she would have to go far in her statement to put the financial markets so that they would not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that Z@@ inser@@ tion would ease the financial markets because they would resolve the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set around 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ et@@ tish conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ elles had said spring and in early summer , that despite the discomfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the state would be expected . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank into 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that sees the F@@ ed as full employment . &quot;
wage extensions have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although the inflation continued under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can cope with higher interest rates and also needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Macro@@ economics at Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets all over the world ended up in late month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated his currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average was expected in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors were feared that the Chinese economy would sink global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has a little recovered this month , whereas the Dow is nearly 10 % below the figure from May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al influences the most complex calculation , when you should increase the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news concerning the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent few weeks would not be reported , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff . &quot;
he says that she will wait at least one month to try to get the effects better .
&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is nearly no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy &apos;s health is fol@@ ly one of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically in its decision making . &quot;
&quot; but , in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority is become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been huge .
&quot; the mere notice of the former Leit@@ ers Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; tight expansion &quot; &quot; mat@@ tered con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ woven with each other , they can not only monitor the developments at another point but also consult with other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is more art than science , &quot; &quot; says Zach@@ ary kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a history of excessive actions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , En@@ act member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de agreed for a co @-@ acquisition , quote decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its leit@@ z@@ ins at 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions , &quot; despite an impressive impact on the growth of the USA , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives covered these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed was supposed to place aspects of financial stability only during a difficult crisis such as the University College in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the committee on the interest point to the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence do not come near to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly wants not to get into the situation where they are afraid of an inser@@ tion , because the markets should arise , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think they should rush over time . &quot;

parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area and together with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not hard to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
you are welcome to prepare for you a warm welcome not without the commitment of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a number of people who support rather un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
with them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with her 74 rounds she is still taught .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in the asylum @-@ heim street . &quot;
&quot; there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is the very different teaching at a real school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is temp@@ ted to inform women about how important good nutrition is during the breastfeeding period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted with fr@@ ameworks , who are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , those babies give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that higher calcium intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation , the mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet were actually protecting the genes of their babies and protect them from the evolution of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the community of Bern@@ ried approved the award for the 2,3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar fl@@ atten@@ s .
plans for the long @-@ long turn@@ around of athle@@ tics are coming forward for step by step : in the recent community council meeting the written construction was dealt with without a big discussion .
&quot; prior to this , the panel among other things had decided to give an application for a structural &quot; &quot; universal &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; for the &quot; exception , &quot; it was a permit for a special form regarding construction reconstruction . &quot;
&quot; thus , a &quot; saddle d@@ ach with non @-@ cov@@ eted first and roof top is built . &quot;
&quot; the background is the intended use of the roof for solar power : &quot; this is why we get a wonderfully large southern hand , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; went in turn around the pit@@ falls that should be prescribed for energetic reasons - unlike in the construction plan , but under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore needed because the development plan for the expansion plan is not permitted for an &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is usually des@@ perate in the common contracts . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project for the turn@@ around : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ around in the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports .
in the next application stage the construction process for the 18 x 36 metres has now been presented to the land@@ holder to review .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed early - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed to Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) new health director at Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees take from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these were seen the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , which promoted the Coun@@ cils Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board also make a decision on the supervisory board , and the ten@@ dering in the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority sol@@ le with fishermen and re@@ inst@@ ated inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the collaborators , that cannot be offered with g@@ ong@@ au , should be offered to work in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed about their plans .
&quot; triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ ders , who started the medical manager of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private office in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; on the question of who to take the follow @-@ up , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who declared as &quot; Fischer &quot; to the game , who declared himself ready to take over the direction from the 1st of October and to exchange with his team after Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this for all in any case , a &quot; &quot; validation &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the Offer in the area of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ acing and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; for the next two years , fishermen with his team should lead to their team when the Supervisory Board would agree to both houses , until then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ hood , which has still 35 beds , finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg , after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the county had planned this for 2018 if it finished in the ongoing renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; land@@ grab@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ white , which is also Chair of the Supervisory Board , commented out to what the house , which in possession of the federal union , would be used , in the future as accommodation for asylum mo@@ on@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; I finish the close . as it goes with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White does not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ e .
&quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity did not come back , &quot; said fishermen about the qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch who had &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the employees &quot; positively . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a chief specialist for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he had been asked to assume the post of medical director by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues .
&quot; the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again and again recently signed by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are requested today evening ( 20.@@ 15 h ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal the clear favorite , cause for arrogan@@ ce however nobody . &quot;
in the past season the bad@@ ener related to the B@@ HC is a sore defeat and have something to do there .
Jag@@ y@@ fall with two los@@ ers at Pr@@ at@@ au

a suspi@@ cious energy has led the police to the body of the one since Saturday I miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation of the twenty @-@ year @-@ old , the young people killed and their cor@@ pse cast into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one since Saturday I missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz is a non@@ violence broke out .
&quot; the young lady &apos;s sur@@ che was found at Kaiser@@ slau@@ ausen with Kaiser@@ slau@@ tern , as a pro@@ secutor &apos;s office and police arrived on Wednesday . &quot;

the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after visiting a fall established in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen didn &apos;t come as agreed at home .
&quot; when searching for the young woman , the investigation took to personal items of the victim . &quot;
&quot; with surveys in the friendship and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was eventually a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the mut@@ in@@ ic perpetr@@ ator led the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the dead was found . &quot;

refugees need accommodations : study warns in front of apartment buildings
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable place .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is just a challenge .
the distribution battles in the German housing market have long started .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with Anglo @-@ weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , including between 2020 and 400@@ ,000 new units must be built up to 400@@ ,000 new units . &quot;
&quot; to this end , a study comes on behalf of the exile &quot; social &quot; social housing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to compare , this year are finished in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units . &quot;
this is a lack of 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees are no longer committed to their stay in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
&quot; many of them come across to the apartment market , and go into the long queu@@ es up before the flats for rentals . &quot;
&quot; in the last year , however , the first half of the Federal Republic of Germany expects less than half of all asylum seekers for rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the building market lies not only at the increasing numbers of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of the past years .
Germany cuts a residential deficit in front of it which will become bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently missing in the metropolitan areas already around 77@@ ,000 residential units , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , the author of the study . &quot;
many professional appeal therefore stayed in large cities not@@ e@@ aded in the WG rooms .
young adults stayed for the F@@ c@@ te on the apartment market un@@ voluntarily longer in the &quot; &quot; hotel M@@ om &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in the cities the number of square meters per capita in the past years has gone back for the first time .
&quot; to solve the problem , the Coalition &quot; &quot; social structure building &quot; &quot; makes a new start . &quot;
new incentives should boost the social housing construction again .
&quot; this could be abandoned on the Earth &apos;s tax tax , and the basic tax for funded apartments will be exposed . &quot;
&quot; according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ control possibilities are necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee revenue of the state bank Kf@@ W comes in both towns and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start , the amount of around 300 million euros has been spent at the Monday night with 18@@ 4 million . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could be increased . &quot;
refugees have a free movement : Croatia and Slovenia leads to
&quot; after Hungary , practically no more is coming through , more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that pass through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is still dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to reach Slovenia with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian internal Minister , and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet Schengen .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the ser@@ eb@@ isch border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people had come over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian bin@@ der sender , RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary held its border to refugees on the morning day .
&quot; new laws , which occurred on the same day , make the or@@ derly asylum in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees go .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border to the EU neighbouring countries in the morning .
&quot; according to the media , most of the media reports reveal Iran , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus as well as with Ta@@ xen in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after arriving they would have tried walking over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian Ser@@ b border the refugees do not come across to the border fence .
&quot; however , the border stri@@ des other dangers : there are also sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ mining is now to establish a safe passage in that direction . &quot;
after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police had cut out 3@@ 66 people .
just before the door after the Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws contain the overcoming and damage of the Grenz@@ za@@ us as criminal offen@@ se .
in the South @-@ Hungarian city of Sz@@ eged it was therefore 35 m@@ oths .
accounts for five years and deportation from the country under arrest warrant to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; according to the immigrants of the immigration authorities , on Tuesday , on Tuesday , in the new arrivals of the border , he settled on 94 refugees , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants , there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees left there .
&quot; practically , however , no one has got a view to get asylum in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; after ung@@ ar@@ ischer , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after all , the rejected asylum seekers should get there be de@@ ported . &quot;
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there are only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to s@@ nu@@ g@@ gle with it .
they collected the garbage of left some of the tens of thousands of people in the weeks on the road@@ side .
pl@@ aster tracks have been abol@@ ished and one of the in@@ ges@@ tion camp in the border was rebuilt .
the aim of this conversion has nobody to express .
Austria may reach only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has ampli@@ fied its border controls .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants were still in place in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuing journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
almost a smaller groups of refugees met regularly in open @-@ air .
Mayor continued &quot; tran@@ scri@@ bed &quot; on the border
&quot; we were stuck after the bridge fifth on Sunday with the eff@@ ec@@ ers , when suddenly ten people were with travel tra@@ ilers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Town@@ ler . &quot;
tourists ; they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had res@@ igned on Sunday but due to the refugee flow the train traffic with Austria was surprising in the end of the refugee camp . he immediately offered his help and the tran@@ sit@@ ory with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the close trade .
previously we have only verk@@ ö@@ sti@@ gt with J@@ rep@@ el and Be@@ ver@@ ages .
we said the same thing we are bringing them to Pass@@ au .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said Pl@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to hand a generous donation - 100 euros for fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; &quot; so the city ler . &quot;
&quot; the ex@@ tran@@ ged migr@@ ations were migr@@ ated on Sundays from an ICE in a regional step towards Pass@@ au , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was dis@@ continued but still trying the border . &quot;
but the regional train was made off the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ boundary generally is high in the course .
&quot; the bridge @-@ fortified with Bavaria &apos;s neighbours on Sunday , soci@@ able , as previously an arc tour sp@@ it - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now has tens of thousands of thousands of us , a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately to assist in the setting up structures that guarantee humanity , the German Chancellor continued to formally and publicly read the position of the Hungarian government in the nuclear energy of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; Un@@ fortunately , these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the bor@@ der@@ land areas with chaotic states . &quot;
&quot; also the donated will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; hidden country &quot; &quot; that is invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , in view of the continuing refugee streams and a winter season , to produce for us decent states for protection seekers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even bigger one - peace , security and stability in Austria to maintain . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ rad in search of 3@@ 5.000 , winter@@ ing quarters . &quot;
Konrad has to do hands with the refugee propag@@ ation of all hands .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has used the previous powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker to raise quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the initial acceptance center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already given Con@@ rad , in the process . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodations of 20,000 refugees came from Monday to Austria without great turmoil , follow Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; lu@@ cr@@ ative situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad expects Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ry in the he@@ ur@@ age year . &quot;
&quot; in order to fulfill the number , you need to find 3@@ 5.000 accommodation in the coming weeks - 20,000 the countries will be able to make 15,000 , higher the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can make it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the governor .
&quot; one could have secured it , even for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it runs well , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , going to explain how the church will help . &quot;
&quot; we are also committed to great expectations of asylum @-@ ordinator as we do in the OR@@ F @-@ Action &quot; Help , like we . &quot;
private persons are conveniently located on the platform .
&quot; furthermore , one hopes for hotels that are left empty during winter . &quot;
&quot; finally , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of down@@ times , it could not be that quot@@ as sees a certain height of the hand@@ tu@@ i@@ tive holder or size of the upper ones . &quot;
for a refreshment time would have to apply &quot; not@@ standards . &quot;
&quot; that in contrast to the Department of Interior at the accommodation was more successful , &quot; &quot; he was refer@@ enced with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentleman , who is not yet in my face to the face of the fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;

&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no cost , as they said himself . &quot;
your employees want to increase their number to four to four .

Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; not only an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena , and Design Center to find refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not necessary since one cannot accommodate these measures at any time without those measures , said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , further locations are intended for emergency purposes . &quot;
criticism of the city chief is committed to the distribution of refugees within the federal territory .
also other districts must contribute to its contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone with the bay@@ ern Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( VP ) announced the other method of action in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however there now would be the corresponding border controls .
special extracts with refugees after Germany will give it no more to the moment .
but the protection seekers would however be handed to by regular trains to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by other EU member states , P@@ lek@@ inger called for even greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that even Austria leads again to its limits , a logical consequence is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the company is moved to a new company , the rest ( 2@@ 700 @-@ square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the clever heads are our crude leaders - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ firms of the New Advertising and also on which to accum@@ ulate .
from the beginning it wants to cooperate with the new neighbors already from the very beginning - he does a lot of promising : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic promises to be just a question of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.@@ 3 million euros a Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is regulated by Linz AG for 60 years of S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 @-@ square meters area in the building are rented already , for another 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta has wanted to put a dog in a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to put up the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ Market Ark@@ ade , finally , now it has gotten more wax in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; at the Fur@@ la shop in contrast to the business , in which she sells among other cases , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers , now everything is about the hand@@ bag of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allets are now available from 75 euros . &quot;
bigger bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously a number of weeks has been changed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid , if I have to open a store , &quot; says wide . &quot;
&quot; decisive for deciding was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the S@@ ants in the Greater Linz to sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion @-@ interest has been wide from her mother to the cradle .
I &apos;m deaf most if something developed and i can show up new trends at all @-@ time prices .
why as there is so some woman to look at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in tin duty and also the professional wife is not able to answer with the last security .
maybe it is worth it to be a nice bag of every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants will be called An@@ gi@@ ver .
this property also combines man@@ cher even with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
whether he is portra@@ yed out of xen@@ opho@@ bic end@@ lessly ( journalist for the U.S. presidential policy ) - the candidate for the US presidential regime ceas@@ es the campaign fight vigor@@ ously .
and cuts good .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ alz region of K@@ all@@ stadt , where some of the grandparents of the property with finest ard@@ ors are encountered . &quot;
the New Yorker with the barrel refres@@ her is a concept for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ person place is above -@@ zig corners with it related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ all@@ ine Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villagers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow that is thrilling , but in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter nature , they are not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; said Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the striking K@@ all@@ ine hi@@ ker has an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous spra@@ yer , which beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for modest , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would surely be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
so for the king of the heart he did not put it there .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also ten@@ den@@ cial the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big w@@ reck@@ age , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nickname of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the don@@ ors says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the anus .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather emigr@@ ated and opened a pub in the USA to make a pub . &quot;
basic stone of the real estate project was the first real estate @-@ sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy : your desire to return to the country in the long time , sh@@ attered on the Bav@@ arian state , that the Pf@@ alz had belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for the pf@@ alz history and folk songs , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is at contrast to the follow @-@ up statements of the descendants .
the had repeated over @-@ Mexican immigrants in the United States and called the construction of a border wall demanded to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the polar , this is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relationship of Tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born @-@ born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ e@@ zer in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always like a thousand . &quot;
believes he feels that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he is never cared about at K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension vert@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz Heinz felt came to a visit to the Church &apos;s seal that was generally good .
&quot; I cannot conceive of the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ ells it better , if he is not known , for &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot;
&quot; if those at the time of his grandfather had they had as they would have been , they would have never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interest@@ ingly topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ er Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for the Tr@@ ump long interviewed , have seen 12 000 movies , even in the USA awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bav@@ arian Community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;

in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the Alpine Club is responsible for its award .
the &quot; mountain village &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; Seven &apos;s sunrise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in the show show &quot;
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson hurry to the Liber@@ ation of the Liber@@ als in order to report subsequently to the loss of leaders in the Liber@@ als but it has not produced a major shift in the assessment for today &apos;s assessment .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the anim@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was shown in London as part of a week series of international TV broad@@ casts to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; that downside of the uprising seemed to be no part of playing for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise above 39@@ ,000 spectators were able to see among the five capitals , in comparison to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today reported a slight increase in ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in recent months the gap has closed to sunrise .
&quot; in August , today , the average reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 50,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September Sun@@ rise is at average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening in every morning .
the winds of change concern these day@@ care more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ enst@@ ar of many to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recent un@@ wit@@ t@@ ated father , who decides to settle in with his two children at the New Zealand &apos;s shores , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son took a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ te Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed heavily with 1.@@ 136 million spectators , and proposed easily The block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in an evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 h ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe revealed on an average 44@@ 6.000 viewers . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; the first half hour had been reached by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make Nine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at is ultimately going to prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for million dollars that never managed to re@@ boot the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret to reveal ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons rock fields , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may seem ignorant of who wins the Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , finally lan@@ ted at the Sam Wood into The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was wrapped in greatest confidentiality . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not disclose if they are the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons of rock in the day before three two become in@@ accurate , you might accidentally have given a clue to who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood continues to sealed his lips up to the finals on Thursday
&quot; all three women left themselves in a ly@@ ric way why wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed , &quot; If not you , who was to keep Woods last rose ? , &quot; could their responses to be crus@@ hing who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons rock fields and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day on .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s &apos;s energies were spot@@ ted with that I felt quite compatible and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons rock faces . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it is so fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
you feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be very well suited .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that this house was last week to realize that wood &quot; &quot; The One &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realize that it is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m calling on him now , she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose who wood choose sol@@ le , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m. , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were a lot of other teams that sent requests to his impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some trainers would have ex@@ iled Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game as he lost as opposed to the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ts on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula familiar his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a breach of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to be shown to be true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team summ@@ ed by the mill , encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special travel@@ ers Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget its p@@ atz@@ posted catch and get care about the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented with a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first playing field of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Ge@@ ital for his N@@ FL de@@ pot . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the box and told the Australian Radio Duo H@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not launch their N@@ FL career in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that &apos;s a thing that happens now , you just look after the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne signed the l@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin Deb@@ t then in 2007 when a pass took place at his own in @-@ Go@@ al region for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn fin@@ au@@ sur in front of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is not new teachers for the many new students , &quot; We need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the conflict , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise we will receive mis@@ indications in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the old @-@ day group of free voters pers@@ ists until Friday in the Turkish commune .
&quot; actually , very different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominating the Free voters .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is super@@ imposed by the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they gave during the rise of Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not possible , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot;
&quot; after all , asylum seekers want to push the Free voters as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum ; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W Chief critici@@ zed that several federal states not rigor@@ ously rigor@@ ously be : &quot; we bro@@ w federal national standards of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others do not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become stronger . &quot;

but this is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; the F@@ W leader said . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ as@@ tics Asia which want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .

&quot; the &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; is missing from the German energy war that possibly 30 billion euros may be re@@ generated . &quot;
the federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies also recover somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) . &quot;

&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report by the US &quot; Bar@@ ron &quot; had been working towards &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; from the weekend . &quot;

4 people killed after poli@@ c@@ emen group on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four men , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police officers were killed , having been demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;

&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the applied rubber bul@@ lets , of which are known to be killing , but traditionally used as less fatal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the struggle was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ alese protests , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ei@@ di say , that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ ar@@ u who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 law enforcement , have been in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been central to the centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution is since 2008 on the way , but the legis@@ lature had accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;

the figure for around ten to twelve million Euro @-@ expensive projects has been active in the discussion for months .
&quot; severe reaction under the Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ poss@@ eses , who had come into their session , called for the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ bus@@ sin@@ king and board member of the interest of the stakeholders , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge block that overlooks all the other bushes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critics that the transport through the intended size of the system would increase greatly : &quot; all bus cards must come to make this more &quot; , &quot; so Schulz : &quot;

Google will start dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign , which shall help thousands of refugees who over@@ ri@@ dden the thousands of refugees , as they flee from war and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach to informing the donations record on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; to our trip we included many dark railway and bus trips as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants grew up in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately desper@@ ately need help . &quot;
&quot; the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations to provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally accumulated funds up to the value of 5.5 million can be doubled up to about 11 million dollars .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many people escaped from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics can be a weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss may live longer than those who don &apos;t get surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial in the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
weight loss or obesity . use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , Adi@@ posit@@ as operations have proved efficient and efficient , but most studies have been carried out in humans , the disease @-@ obes@@ e with a body size index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that anyone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers obtained from Tai@@ wan@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and can compare to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I , among those who undergo the operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the 5th year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with the one who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately equal at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to a surgical procedure , it sol@@ ves completely at 36 % of the diabe@@ tic disease and partly at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , it was completely dissolved by diabetes only by one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were out of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c who reflects the blood sugar over the years .
ha@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept by 7 per cent in writing .
&quot; after surgery , the average tick @-@ glob@@ in in A@@ 1@@ c level sank from around 9 percent to about 6 percent . &quot;
but in the medical therapy group it remained stable at around 8 percent .
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; is reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not to mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also denied average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and reported more rather a complete change of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival , after five years of survival , there are evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subject to obes@@ e people , who subjected to a obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that attempted conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said Black@@ stone , it was soothing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is located with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , which have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that seems to be recognized in fiction more times : a young woman , to school hours un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , is after years the sho@@ al of their youth back , and this is in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; actually , we are not so &quot; &quot; Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love history , the novel is supposed to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers as he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is happy that she was able to put her homeland a literary monument .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for people to end violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the UK in his speech at the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which dedicated itself to ethics studies .
&quot; he demanded that , among the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents . &quot;
he also stressed the reaction of the western European countries to the refugee crisis certainly is admir@@ able but the situation is not reasonable .
&quot; it is impossible that everybody can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama was praised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to get out of the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you will have to think about long @-@ term solutions , just as a genuine peace and genuine development , mainly by education , which can be created for these Muslim countries &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
ultimately we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and presented that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events after themselves .
&quot; after September 11 I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to resolve this issue lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence and that has in@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase in intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer by children in the last four years
&quot; po@@ ison manufacturing centers in the US report on an almost 400 percentage increase in the number of children under twelve years , who swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand@@ des@@ i@@ ti@@ zer , thus Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand@@ des@@ ti@@ zer children under 12 are reporting , covering 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately there is a percentage of them go to the ER , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink as some of them do to impress their friends or because of a bol@@ ster with social media .
watch video on YouTube how young infectious agents only drink because of some cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic se@@ wage water mixed to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be shocked by attractive scents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ach@@ ized .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and oran@@ ges , which are very pleasing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can already be a few guns that lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ Call Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let S@@ luck whis@@ ky at hand , but people allow this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , having recently received four injection of after straw@@ berry duc@@ t@@ des@@ ti@@ zer from school , was taken into a emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; their blood vessels was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered by an adult by an adult as a drunk , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , which she studied at the G@@ win@@ ch Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acked her words , and was not able to walk when she arrived in an emergency . &quot;
doctors supervis@@ es them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and caused the head to stum@@ ble said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ ner Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use soft products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant and store san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ is@@ ations were several dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with death cases .
&quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the slip of hanging singing instruments , which contained a toxic , non @-@ cl@@ oned ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health agencies assume that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which is not@@ ated as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January three students of the fourth class in the state New York , their &quot; mass &quot; instruc@@ tive to po@@ isons , using anti @-@ bacterial products around the teaching region , &quot; announces it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to slopes and ex@@ iles them from their room .
the police looked at the mis@@ guided plan as &quot; Ges@@ er@@ tz &quot; and rejected high @-@ confidence measures to the school authority .

&quot; I don &apos;t think we are feeling less than pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition at the Scottish soccer no@@ vels Nieder@@ sachsen - de Bo@@ er
the former ranking players and former national players in the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch fans had lost interest in Celtic because there are no titles @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they will not show any highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here speak not just about the return of the ranking .
you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they both speak together about the two teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people of Scotland who want to see those games . &quot;
I will turn the things around . I am n@@ essing Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sul@@ try , turn things into . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent separation from the Champions League , defeat was followed against 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen which now stand out clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; however , Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this as it is - but we must continue .
&quot; we really need to really get support from Celtic , because that will make the players better . &quot;
now all together is so important .

&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent was about c@@ anti@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as showed the figures for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the employment grew in Scotland by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
the employment rate of Scotland fell over the course of the quarter compared to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I will witness an exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will be seeing how a man brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it isn &apos;t happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery at the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip will be ex@@ ested by the pl@@ ot@@ injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was already first presented in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see Hin@@ ts in the United States , and as often more applicants are available as seats , there is a mak@@ ab@@ ere lottery instead , to decide which will be chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the total number of media courts from 12 to five .
who gets selected will observe it .
I cannot do this .
I will sit down alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest to friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pin , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I describe me with her .
&quot; she sp@@ ells that she could put it better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it . &quot;
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to write an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I will not want to enter all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe that a strong likelihood is , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot;
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death judge .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can contact him .
&quot; what you will get from me is what it is , a man will see an unnecessary death . &quot;

perhaps they must take my license and exp@@ ire I and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where I mean the same thing and that is sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it@@ ational level of the trainer will deal with the long lasting Kob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could throw his license across the table .
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ ador@@ ned master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , referred to a package mud , or sound to the horse deb@@ ating , which ble@@ w up against the rules . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistak@@ enly mud on the leg .
it would have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been like the whole day yesterday something that was like this .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with pack day at the race day . an inquiry into this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here it is too far gone , Moo@@ dy said . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes up against ri@@ vals from claims to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised criticism of the Tac@@ tics of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League dominant of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers of the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring @-@ competing &quot; will be allowed with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney &apos;s qualifying session .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made some difficult note to the Storm team , after his team had won the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; &quot; example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two from Queensland did not be &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defending the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and told she &apos;s focused on the Tac@@ tics only on their &quot; contact .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team confi@@ dently voice him , as it proved that they were worried by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that emerges again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring @-@ fights , when she got us 24 : 2 &quot; , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we changed nothing throughout the year by our defensive system or techniques , but during the last six weeks we have done our contact to Tac@@ kles for a real point of gravity and this one has provided the tr@@ end@@ ation . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not getting accustomed to losing it so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s strange as this emerges again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Ben@@ nett &apos;s idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and remembers that Ben@@ nett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football won .
Way@@ ne speaks about exciting football .
&quot; he has sounded his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in the year 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he was going to take care of it . &quot;
&quot; but now he &apos;s a team who can play this and that we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have these types of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so that they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build up a stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot;
six weeks ago she was not thinking about us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game Bron@@ ls to co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I &apos;ve not yet seen it , but what was the result ? &quot; 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not make any points something gri@@ eving ?
for me it is the game &apos;s schedules .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has got free this weekend , because it won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday night in the pre @-@ final exam at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start off starting next Thursday morning . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200.000 $ security according to drug cl@@ an@@ age
&quot; a man who may get a li@@ felong sentence due to his experim@@ entation , to come into the possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine which were bi@@ ased to Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of 200,000 $ . &quot;
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . 29 was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay found that from South America got over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police 40 kilograms of drug found in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a viable preparation for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café of a harmless reason might be . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear links to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia with him he said the court on Wednesday .
&quot; when he was a criminal , he lied the police on his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had been offered a b@@ ail of 200.000 dollars as security together , in order to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the independent explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a 200.000 of 200.000 Dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ de@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from having not to appear , they warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , held on the police daily and stick to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl when he slept . log@@ ised to an online mess@@ aging service that he received a number of un@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later on and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the bedroom Ho@@ g@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found confusing noti@@ ons and aler@@ ted immediately to her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; specific &quot; web research , the concepts for the search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g then suggested to the officers that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; and then he set forth to be a poli@@ cem@@ an in order to fri@@ ghten it . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secutor of E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addiction that he is addic@@ ted to frightened people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the seeking on the computer were carried out by him , but he said , unless he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to intimi@@ date is to be frightened to ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more pictures .
he said he did to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he is sick in the head , if he has drinks , and said , he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found news on the phone she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mor , and the wine . &quot;
it then looked on the in@@ decent images on the phone and confron@@ ts the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computers and Play@@ station used to speak to girls who saw much younger than him .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty on January 25 , last year on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; Defence Adv@@ entures Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; can be found in his disposition . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sa@@ ws to the Jud@@ gment until October to preserve background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted security in this case but was also held in examination because of hear@@ ings to other cases .

do@@ user soft to small limits on Germany
more and more refugees will be picked up off the major controversial points at the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many tur@@ user were able to let fear of discovery and capture man more often at smaller border @-@ borders
&quot; on the Austrian side , said a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , only more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ Portal Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal Inn . &quot;
they were walking on bridges and arm@@ rests with the German side .
they are collected from federal police at reception and sent to registration .
at the Munich central station met a lot more refugees from the end of the station on Wednesday at the beginning of the weekend .
&quot; only until 8 : 00 hrs there have arrived some 700 people of the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re @-@ introduction of controls on the Franco @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : pi@@ vot@@ al of Tro@@ ckel @-@ Tower &quot; Henry &quot; is expected in the South@@ west
mete@@ or@@ ologists warn of lightning in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure of Western Europe , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) is currently using in Stuttgart , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
strong exagger@@ ated be the utter@@ ing of the Tro@@ pen@@ crash &quot; Henry &quot; that was drawn over the Atlantic over the past few days from the Bermuda Islands .
severe storms and storm are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , DW@@ D is still in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ b@@ ari@@ d Al@@ b and the Lake Constance group , to calculate with goats of 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
so after Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the accomodation on the IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
2015 is given above all movement with the compact passages that currently sell particularly well .
cars from the comp@@ ac@@ t@@ @-@ class are currently especially asked : about 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations fell according to the new appro@@ vals ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( audience stage 17th to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic conceptual design and new upper @-@ class cars and luxury cars , this year , most of all new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest Premium for the German Autobahn is an Opel A@@ stra , who will be able to stand by traders in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; with this , the volume model sold also well , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive . &quot;
Opel is presenting an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs over 16 9@@ 90 euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1,4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
&quot; the H@@ esse also offer more diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP to 147 kW / / 200 HP , to which the first also includes triple @-@ cylinder petrol engine . &quot;
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra initially only as five or five .
&quot; as a second variant , if in the spring of the comp@@ bi , he will be able to see also at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be there next to the A@@ stra in IA@@ A at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of his A@@ stra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only available as a fifth in a conventional and empha@@ sizes sports GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the market , he will come up in the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ iti : very new in the segment , Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 . &quot;
the Nissan Re@@ aders wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
thereby the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts to its curved Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully into the design of the brand .
the base model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in addition , it is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 HP . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with petrol engine is offered , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter Tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is after manufacturer details at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 that can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; out@@ sides laid out the designer of the ed@@ al Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ ap@@ pers very hand in front of the front@@ lines : here , the he@@ at@@ sink was newly drawn and the modified head@@ lamp with LED technology was equipped . &quot;
inside the inside room the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ system is moderni@@ zed ; the number of buttons is reduced by touch@@ screen and integrated for the first Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
&quot; added to the IA@@ A , a number of re@@ work and new variants such as the impressive Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five m2 of cells are human un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial hospital te@@ amm@@ ers , the mon@@ el@@ ang was lod@@ ged in one to a small cell . &quot;
&quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation , when housed in to small cells . &quot;
this was the Federal Constitutional Court in any decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; in the after@@ math , those affected may even hope to make money if they were only locked in the narrow spaces at a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an explosion @-@ yiel@@ ding were successful with his constitutional complaint between June and November 2009 ; he was located in a single cell of about five square metres of ground floor ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separate . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has been restored to his lawyer again in a clear cell , has shifted into a larger cell . &quot;
his term le@@ age against the un@@ worthy arrest conditions against the Land Berlin in fact failed .
but the constitutional sentences raised the ruling of the chamber of chamber Berlin and transferred the case to the renewed test .
you see the human dignity of the man .
chamber Court now decide about the amount of compensation
&quot; although , for legal reasons only a few days of Haf@@ tt@@ age for the compensation were decisive , was given an equal statement , it was called . &quot;
otherwise &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot;
the chamber of the chamber must now clarify the amount of gel@@ ism .
the constitutional arbit@@ ers in the past often greatly strengthened the rights of prisoners .
&quot; thus they did not appeal in April to a prisoner in@@ mate , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , a decision of a cell that is estimated to be the multi@@ purpose of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; additionally on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed additionally to the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in the parall@@ el@@ incident in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been across a day between 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons were also affected in the head@@ lines for missing personnel in the last few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always en@@ rolled 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ vity rise , even to bat , it should have already come because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the address of the judicial press , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed because of young reasons , 19 should drop off in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we do the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; roughly 800 000 asylum seekers have been to announce from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , following statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; speaking at the CD@@ U ( CD@@ U ) , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated : &quot; &quot; I speak again and again : we can create that , and we create that . &quot;
what is coming to Germany is the following overview .
&quot; needed , according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatically , the lack of living rooms however especially at affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing is out of the rental rate , and the particularly cheap apartments will apply itself to refugees too . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double @-@ double , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is a bit far from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing year , and to this , the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year . &quot;
&quot; also , scientists and federal ministries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing . &quot;
&quot; according to the estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugee population can be found in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be being asked at all systematically following their qualifications in order to get them at first , Claudia Walter , Project man@@ ag@@ ress for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but it is important for the integration of refugees trying to find out whether they are working in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation of society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , says migration researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ es@@ lav , it has been a political shift : from the working regime for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while it was formerly a working ban on asylum seekers from up to five years , this one was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the resi@@ des , which limits the asylum seekers on a home village . &quot;
in the society - also because of the lack of lack of labor - the majority have prevailed in its way that it should become possible to grant refugees more rapid access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing English .
&quot; so far , there is still no significant offer to universal and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs most often be conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the structure of networks is therefore dependent on Thr@@ es@@ hardt the Königs@@ path to employers &apos; integration . &quot;
&quot; the school management announced that only a few hat@@ ched parents found their children to the kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for die parent &apos;s parents , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate . &quot;
to convince the family of the benefits of K@@ ita and distri@@ butes the Administration hand@@ ing in various languages .
&quot; should the need for tut@@ ors rise up strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - approximately by offering more specialist schools . &quot;
in the countries a student will be prepared with no knowledge of my knowledge on the teaching classes .
&quot; they are not always taught by full @-@ educated teachers , but also , as in Berlin , including teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ amps from the Berlin Schul@@ Administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees trying to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum or commemor@@ ated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) , his attitude has now been abandoned . &quot;
&quot; in general , it could be helped to facilitate access to the university . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a sojour@@ ner and d@@ ul@@ ture do not receive achievements after the asylum @-@ rate Act , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter , generally , does not receive any BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they will not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ast persons . &quot;
&quot; toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for so far , to be BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible to be shortened from 1 January 2016 this volume to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but also these financing targets must be closed , request Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin Secretary of State for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a major role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should turn more closely to the same rights as they have the churches , and further developing the existing state @-@ churches to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who cares professionally taking care of the re@@ com@@ ers . &quot;
the Rights also includes duties .
&quot; in this way , representatives of Islam need to be clear and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and lay some control possibilities for it . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is also a readiness to act against religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed in Thursday the concern of religious conflicts , could also be registered to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to destroy such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
&quot; future integration will take much more than today , being a subject of all society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority movement must change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is needed . &quot;
&quot; Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions - for a short @-@ term decade , anti @-@ discrimination and a General Equ@@ al Act . &quot;
&quot; but it really learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motif systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what refugee organisations as well as Socialists and Democrats have committed to non @-@ racial Germany , need to become a reality in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens shall make use of their potential for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to supply the previously expected refugees , writes Doc@@ z@@ te@@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the daily mirror . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be necessary to get extra money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , it is called Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers right in the registration health @-@ types . &quot;
performing services could later be calculated with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term it is highly questionable , as many people anticipate the limited capacity of the catalogue of awareness , of the asylum order of asylum . &quot;
otherwise make it primarily to create language barriers especially .
&quot; even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be more inferi@@ or about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over by interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; it would be a help for many refugees , but even with more general medical contact points in the emergency out@@ ward . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; under refugee , approximately there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and in the young people go about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other disease pictures , German physicians were treated by their education but clear , means Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to be recognized . and as regards the nu@@ is@@ cop@@ ic angel , it is even reli@@ eved in sight by the refugees . &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system : several refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to practice it , however , they would like to demonstrate their qualifications and also to bro@@ c@@ ish tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees in Germany are estimated at least half of the attacks in Germany ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) mentally ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; notably viol@@ ently are migr@@ atory sc@@ ant , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University Munich reg@@ isters that any one of the fifth Syrian refugee camps traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering with a post trau@@ matic disorder , suffers from so@@ oth@@ es to so called Flas@@ h@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ras@@ hes and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleeping , and concentration disorders , severe weakness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , however , only four percent of psych@@ otic sufferers have received refugees a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; admittedly , psych@@ otic cranes can provide for psych@@ otherapy in the social duty for psych@@ otherapy , but it usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the welfare workers or doctors that are not trained for the psychological diseases , whether a therapy would be necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ e@@ ful presentation .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
the gift to the enth@@ used is the family therefore in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take people away from all this time and take her away in a totally different world for two hours , &quot; stressed the 27 @-@ year anniversary of June . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ berg with a world city flair , &quot; &quot; so Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks at its concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus convinced with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn draws the audience with wit and charm into their spell . &quot;

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ uses in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , also takes its position : &quot; it is not good for our animals , it also does not work well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every cu@@ le unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes after every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .

the two animals spent eight years in a en@@ closure and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our small &apos; Jum@@ bo &apos; , &quot; &quot; told Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
the z@@ eb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege for this but the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so for each visitor something is likely to be something about it .

Sim@@ bab@@ y@@ earning Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down at the beginning of the year by a podium . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of this case quickly spread on the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was carried out even by the asser@@ tions of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death dro@@ pping and they were warned against the address given by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ created .
last month they took him in @-@ bed and interrupted him during his speech to the State &apos;s location in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese told that seven op@@ positions politician SMS messages received in their mobile phones that they were afraid of distur@@ ban@@ ces &apos; Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has sent the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe speech . &quot;
&quot; they warned by the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
the Chief speaker said the party was &quot; concerned by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; party &quot; was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is building up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build up to 30.000 jobs in the framework of the company &apos;s restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will be listed later this year in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business of its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business operations .
&quot; expected job building leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which is to initiate the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming less and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of stores that support companies when making a transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ 2012 and is dedicated to providing so far err@@ ation , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; said an explanation of the company . &quot;
it shares a company that was founded by graduates from the Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard was founded to produce electrical installations and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage @-@ man called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley .
HP has passed a massive restructuring to cope with the influ@@ x of traditional PCs to tackle mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the two @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech company , is the latest in this area based on the belief that much focused company has a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; little emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere it is until September and provided his rehabilitation according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer at European Championship has certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le deep and then returned to its old cur@@ l during the pres@@ eas@@ on season .
&quot; this kind of breach does not threat the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t well healing .
this is no longer a matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his buttons or with the injury he had previously .
&quot; this may come true from purely medical view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the risk of other violations of injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops in a unpleasant pattern .
&quot; the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had recorded various diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere , since his debut , six years ago . &quot;
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als in the end of 65 of Arsen@@ als in the last five game periods .
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs were who have noted most vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; maneu@@ ver accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have to have an ab@@ rupt period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win battle against war , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope , his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ cap on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey , not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of dessert Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and to give players who need a short break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al favor@@ ites are , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing fields with the greatest intimi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by a earthqu@@ akes , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; turning , the point is that arsen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation over Monaco and will remain driven by far hope , with its management to guide the society to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendly Fest : the com@@ edy show that granted us serious lessons of men of men
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for males to open itself , now even more desp@@ ised than ever , as self @-@ moral under young men are shown in a 15 @-@ year @-@ face . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important deaths among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ un@@ ner ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of putting the culture into question , the men are hin@@ dering to seek help if they need this . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study conducted with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms announced that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery fell in double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends once to work for a friendship .
&quot; in the age of social media guided communication , focusing on style over substance is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , li@@ jo@@ ying and successful to appear , doubled , even if in reality dominates the isolation . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by the dominates what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at expense - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much more deeply . &quot;
and as explained a video @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated ; money really cannot buy luck .
&quot; the Beautiful at Friends was Friends , that this focuss@@ ing on the head was placed . &quot;
&quot; every character was not defined through his work , but by his personality , which shine through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football ( Rachel ) and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a member of the phone spiritual care I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; my cue role for people who are de@@ pressed and endangered themselves , has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to speak with friends .
&quot; I come along with the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come into practice &quot; &quot; a tremendous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which comes to my mind , even if I try to offer long @-@ term ration@@ ing mechanisms . &quot;
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my object @-@ li@@ fic out@@ si@@ ding status over the phone also may help people &apos;s eye to look at the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why don &apos;t you then take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you look around in Star@@ bucks anyone alone , give him a smile and tell you Hello . &quot;
one never knows what the difference your friendship might do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - complete 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Mary meets to help PS@@ G to help Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Lu@@ son Cav@@ ani after his work against Malmö .
&quot; di Mary meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , and helps PS@@ G to go to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game &apos;s report and the response to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and her son Cav@@ ani kept a course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain , his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought to the French champion off the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before they finally reached their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head of the head@@ board posted . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Donetsk also in the group A , Paris requires a strong start with the Swedish master , as they not only seek the qualification for the throat rounds , but rather an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a Kl@@ ass@@ esp@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ kers Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ kers team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ e career in 1999 , starting out in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents to cause problems and relax@@ es back , even though there are certain things that we have to stop in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I &apos;ve regre@@ t@@ ted that we have not yet scored one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on our own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was released in the fourth minute through Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing was put forward as the man to take advantage of the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was running in the last month of Manchester United , before joining Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; if however , someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö making the Celtic in a Play @-@ off suggested to achieve this position , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was de@@ ple@@ ted with five national @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field has become a serious opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ ader P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , she offered her little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , the PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and p@@ auses not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who did not last less than five attempts in the first half half , and then after Cav@@ ani , returned to him after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic to which Di Maria was turned into a revol@@ ving , which was b@@ illed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pin . ... &quot;
&quot; the second goal finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ he had thus achieved his six@@ tieth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well that had been found . &quot;
&quot; this ended all thoughts that Malmö can return to the game , and only a brilliant entry from Wil@@ and from short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to stop the end result , before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end . &quot;
&quot; the Trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave to that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; Our last champi@@ ons game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league that has not the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fiers do not extend it . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 changing to FC Bayern
world@@ - and Europ@@ ame@@ ister X@@ avi played a sport club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously set up just a few years ago , just before the obligation of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times of Spanish champion , three times champion of champion , two times champion of the world champion , two times euro@@ pe@@ ister , two times Europe champion , one time of the world champion , the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , he left 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years , FC Barcelona , and went to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now that he was already in front of the EM 2008 at the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; I told me , that Bar@@ ça sell me to sell . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won at that time everything , we &quot; &quot; tells him &quot; . &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was a offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot;
to memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ gen@@ berg took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi don &apos;t inter@@ change
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man therefore works for the German record : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM .
PE@@ P has told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he cannot imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with this , he has triumph@@ ed me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s Play@@ time 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against Bavaria about the whole distance on the lawn , turned the Red off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated on the end of the top class triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker , Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said , she is not required behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night based on HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do you do at the occupation of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown reacted , shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay . &quot; &quot; than the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian &apos;s solidi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s producer , and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people about thinking about it - who will also be the director ever - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
the only black person and she is a N@@ ut@@ te which is be@@ aten by her white in@@ age .
the producer of De@@ ar White People stood up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on rejected that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want .
&quot; after the discussion is broadcast , the Social Media explo@@ ded in front of the approval about Dam@@ on Comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger at the clip by wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - that is SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned over 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ ons comments arrive at a moment when accurate racial representation is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Mat@@ ter took effect and urged regul@@ ators and authorities to discrimin@@ atory practices against colored areas . &quot;
in February the singer Prince conducted an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inee albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent , &quot; ( albums are still their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black , they still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and as a response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , if the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leader . &quot;
&quot; recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees to discuss the Pope on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees to discuss the Pope , to discuss about the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos; First Champion
&quot; professional sports clim@@ bers , and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero , was the first athle@@ te which won the American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which finished just their 7th season , had never seen a competition participant , who could complete all stages of its obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season &apos;s fin@@ ales there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final . &quot;
the last task was to rock climbing at a 75 feet long climbing route in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended up the task within the time with which he was the first Ath@@ let , who completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . but , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock on winning the Great Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or lived , &quot; said Isaac E . &quot;
as suddenly as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he was first finished in all the course , not any prize money . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life ; he receives the magnificent atro@@ phy .
I don &apos;t think he wins over it .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ces on Minnesota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; formerly , they used one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers reduced to their role as a Spo@@ iler , however the part in Tuesday playing perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins sp@@ ined a chance to climb within a gam@@ bler of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of three letter F @-@ words , which was difficult to put in over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad exc@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; Alfredo Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held its early offensive until Detroit , pun@@ ched in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times on in the 1 / 3 interior and made possible three R@@ uns .
it was his third @-@ successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end the year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of every game , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot;
the vice @-@ design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ us who served his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he has had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has prosp@@ ered well , &quot; said Ex@@ am@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at her ( head@@ ring training ) , looked significantly better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three rings in the rear at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center fiel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron &apos;s Job reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ er to the Stri@@ ke@@ out , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran walls , the only man with whom he has been confronted , before the nom@@ inee R@@ ook@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , who settled the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run the second brought together the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ cher to a Double Play .
&quot; it was that in the Major League for 27 times this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added to Detroit at the end of the ninth attack , managed wall a R@@ BI @-@ double set against the c@@ il@@ age of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don , and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; but the right @-@ handed place , however , S@@ ano for three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit performed for a pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three quar@@ es in the first two sl@@ ings to the right @-@ hand veteran who had been l@@ acked before the game by the offen@@ ding list after a single month . he had been ste@@ ered for more than a month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I said , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I moved and sen@@ sed that I would make some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
after she received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter for the first time she gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game that got a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ es in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was tried out of the game , when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
the tig@@ ers used in the second to run a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and one Two @-@ out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ts for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not perform especially well , but he knew the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pit@@ ch @-@ coun@@ sel , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right A@@ ries . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three H@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four cor@@ ke@@ outs .

Isch@@ g : German military measures in Syria
&quot; the head of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the decisive re@@ thinking about military action must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective @-@ away . &quot;
four years ago he was happy that the Kel@@ ch had passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now , one of the conflict slo@@ wed in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Germany . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the local refugees .
Austria controls on the south and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again put national controls on its southern and Eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , and after Hungary no one is sent back . &quot;
also Germany has sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is thus agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; to ask the question an agreement , after Germany , a certain number of refugees came from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , has already given such a dialogue between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives in Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers called them not and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees had come from the so @-@ called bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann arranged a special summit for next week together with several other European heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU countries did not have to agree to a common action in the crisis so far .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a special course on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special course , for the binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the former up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; this covenant , together with the countries , announced Merkel at the late After@@ noon after nearly four @-@ hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the reg@@ istrar in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lining the people who need protection , be@@ aten them too . &quot;
&quot; but who has no lead perspective , could not remain in Germany too . &quot;
this opinion had been widely divided into the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed the state as a whole I now need to deal a &quot; huge force of exer@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; thousands of refugees , meanwhile , put in the bal@@ kan@@ route . &quot;
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres from fron@@ tier during the night for Tuesday .
&quot; only a few hours announced the government in Budapest , including the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent cur@@ ves@@ ters chro@@ mium jumping over Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to , to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian Government sentenced the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of men who had cut off the fence .
in Turkey meanwhile there were many more migrants on the road to the Greek border .

the researchers conclude from sightings of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon ble@@ w easily on its way around the ring plan@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this exchange movement was only small , but still too big for a consistently solid sky , it is said in a communication by Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US @-@ State New York ) of Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; review .
even longer it was known that there must be a hot water under the Eis@@ ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us Water .
&quot; so , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered on the south pole of Satur@@ day@@ mon@@ ds , the water vap@@ or and ice @-@ particles sp@@ ells in order for the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
at least the south @-@ pole I had to give a lower sea with the astronom@@ ers at that time .
&quot; however , the extension of the hidden ocean was not yet clarified . &quot;

man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .

&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or to be firm and pleas@@ urable . &quot;
the form@@ work colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so can also taste green man@@ gos very tasty .
&quot; it should be eaten at room temperature , and consumed within a few days . &quot;
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square
&quot; nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there has been a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , I was bapti@@ sed to the name of the German Reform@@ ator on Wednesday . &quot;
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was filed by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants from the city of the Pon@@ tific@@ ate over centuries as a minority could often only live in secret their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic manner , the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a dish@@ on@@ our .
his negative impressions might be a tribute to the view of historians in his later fight against Rome .
and then Lu@@ ther had begun with his thes@@ es against the sh@@ aded church in the division of the ab@@ domin@@ als .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old has painted for its Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has updated the introduction and scrip@@ tex@@ te updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that is now published with gorgeous images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated its very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms have obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old forms - but not equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ dding project , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many domains of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dedic@@ ates themes such as cru@@ g , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; and therewith he fascinated several partners : this is the same for the Lu@@ ther Verlag , with his the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler Verlag , with his emphasis on art books . &quot;
and here is above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post which per@@ ched itself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible points .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible from Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible , and thus translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible prophecy of Martin Lu@@ ther and each one of the artist &apos;s personal thoughts here .
the gem@@ s has golden letters .
&quot; thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
it is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately all trig@@ gers for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who owned the strict Protestant Prince Order . &quot;
&quot; then the education happened with the tube , &quot; reminds Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work out to me , perhaps even again with the Lord Father . &quot;
his second concern is to help the art again in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pictures is co@@ iled today by complaints , and that &apos;s loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is passed on there .
artists have a different desire and bliss to show things .
pictures have always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to allow the viewer into the pictures &quot; &quot; down to them &quot; , &quot; discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; &quot; the picture looks at his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post was presented on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like , as he understands with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old did not respect the Bible , but which completely selected for him , even mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about images , the text only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ers from the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ers both ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love and responsibility .
a section of the origin@@ als - pap@@ er- and can@@ v@@ ases - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
construction @-@ start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made plans , place found , company mand@@ ated for a circular course : one year later almost everything was ready - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused by dr@@ en@@ ades , especially among the residents who did not tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill dropped above , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
the approval was to enter October in October . the First Joint Joint Bo@@ ck Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck is now in charge in children &apos;s and youth affairs .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it sol@@ le then without &quot; &quot; further mem@@ orials , &quot; &quot; with working at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga continues a clear indication of the weekend . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , the soccer responds to the p@@ acing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy his help in coping with the problems to come . &quot;
&quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification .
&quot; there nobody can say , that is nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that must be more interested in getting this topic into the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ leader Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or of the chan@@ cell@@ or and the chan@@ cell@@ or of the State Minister there in Mrs econom@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; then the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and want to help .
but the crucial course must face politics .
the German soccer league has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this programme is scheduled by 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A Conference in St. Juli@@ an@@ s / Malta . &quot;
even some federal lig@@ ists support this program .
already at this weekend 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ eine put a clear sign when they take on the left tri@@ but@@ aries instead of the usual sponsorship ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint of &quot; We help - # Don@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that all should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ en Sport@@ maker Ru@@ di Fi@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper and described the project as a &quot; natural . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama is each passing , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we are able to play football @-@ federal lig@@ ament , no , we must use our radi@@ al power , our influence and our ways in order to help the many refugees who have so incredibly suffered , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; prominent character of the League &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the EM @-@ qualifying game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to lobby / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach signed the support for refugees as a &quot; large communal power plant . &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ enses have begun their own projects in their places so great .
&quot; just as magnificent , some small and smallest associations are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for the welcome &quot; &quot; that we have spent , will live in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of tremendous meaning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this and the next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German government will always provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs are already calling the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP Board @-@ Board loses an eye on accident
&quot; the Board of Board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has given the left eye for several reports , according to a fall early July . &quot;
&quot; if he had fallen in the wake of the accident at the house of his brother in the USA , he moved to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; Economic Week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is nearly hem@@ or@@ ated , was power@@ less , then she has to@@ wed out on the street - he told us last week &apos; , the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso royal . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could leave his work .
&quot; early October we meet at the meeting of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said flat . &quot;
the 54 years old manager was with the meeting and &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday instructor ) , he will return to Germany in October , and will continue to lead the software tra@@ inee . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman of H@@ asso &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the S@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually com@@ itted between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer a part of the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; in him it was important to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen something like that . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up , if you like . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart the skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ s a corresponding photo and declared , he has suffered the injury as he was upset by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes with her deser@@ ts in Singapore at the end of the weekend as a reserved driver for both parents Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ uss against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ den@@ ess in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes were sm@@ ashed on a com@@ eback in Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of Europe &apos;s league .
the national player will miss the table leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ am / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot refer to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ uss will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga Top@@ ic against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to exercise on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not change its trunk eleven , not only at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the Tor@@ ry position .

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants the pioneering role for Germany
&quot; Germany should be a pioneer of technological leadership according to the German will &apos;s will , in the change of the car technological . &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett adopted a strategy paper by Wednesday of the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which among other things fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt am the edge of the automobile I.@@ A of a &quot; &quot; new mobile age &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated and inter@@ connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his tor@@ ches from the G@@ 7 states that together come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the transport ministry among other things highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band and up to date in digital hearing .
a testing of new technology is currently being created on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to examine the legal framework , and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany intends to use for example internationally that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised by 10 to 130 hours . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government wants to apply to a change to the Vienna Convention which has so far only seen the people as a driver . &quot;
&quot; as an automated driving takes over the car , the driver is running , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in sections .
&quot; following a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , it will be possible to technically be technically possible on motor@@ ways up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ less cars on public roads were to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated navigation functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; said the SPD @-@ transport police S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clear but clear .
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars but skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; one on Wednesday passed to the survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test Foundation DE@@ K@@ RA to the result of just 8 percent of Germans , that autonomous cars will win over the next ten years only in 20 years of doing so , 31 percent will not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed by 20@@ 25 will count with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , those motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to completely leave their own self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital verbal Federation Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the whole ride on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that could only be seen as 15 per cent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck
it is a mix of very large and big movers and a guard @-@ beak @-@ Gr@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
&quot; highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; you carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was sket@@ ched amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage fits - and with it that he put men into skirts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I am white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was smooth , in the meantime , it was real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( walk on the run ) , that is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ cho@@ ers has changed his at the beginning to a show about his or her person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he had been , for , &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition had a bit about death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you will get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already done at the Canadian Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it involves tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of the man , who wrote in the fashion story without ever having a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not constructed , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograp@@ her overall artwork for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example the sty@@ list was executed . &quot;
14 tons of material have spar@@ ked the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
just before the start of the legend it was a special treat : a leather h@@ oses out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are s@@ cu@@ ff as men ) and for people who are a bit different said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ ages &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is visible in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ingly mo@@ i attempt of the designer . &quot;
&quot; a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he saw his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a d@@ oll to play , his parents were not allowed to do so . &quot;
then he gave fashion to himself later .
&quot; he st@@ acking under fashion and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich told . &quot;
later I bought a course later .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the modul@@ arity .
&quot; they got nothing , but they had allowed the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Point as fashion @-@ niche
earlier they went to the long nit@@ rogen presses and to make stu@@ b meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and characteristics were formed in a large amount for clients that they processed for example in blankets and she@@ ers .
&quot; this alone does not work any more , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ary heat of heat . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , Fashion played a larger role , then it was sup@@ pressed by the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and in regional meetings . &quot;
&quot; at all bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage @-@ style , which is based on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , a rise in the E@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; who has no N@@ ect@@ onic in the textile business in Germany , is no longer the market . &quot;
in us they already make up half of all orders .
Mo@@ ary heat is composed along with nine other companies a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they can carry the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , approximately 80 percent of its sales have been broken . &quot;
private dealers and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products barely reach the customer on this way .
the mass ware in the Asian region has been produced a lot cheaper and almost exclusively over chains .
&quot; also weak@@ le of export , currently to Russia and in the USA . &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explained by the nit@@ rate in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we have a quality seal , showing that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the used materials . &quot;
diploma CEO U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow of West Sax@@ on Academy of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
&quot; to counter@@ ing the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , who must think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
therefore an existing design often only varies slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago well @-@ known textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historical snow @-@ pointed tip .
embro@@ i@@ dered the machine at some places small cows .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ de@@ master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ aus himself let itself inspire : &quot; previously I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
now she uses the snow @-@ pointed tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; said Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the United States , Australia and Finland - above all to the customers whose ancestors live in pl@@ ati@@ tudes and surroundings , and which would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
in this way I see my jewelry as modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends should not twist , but Disney is still focusing on a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a new form of innovation , but a way of continuation that is 20 years after the first movie with the magical n@@ anny . &quot;
we are talking about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in England during World Economic Crisis in England .
who plays more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director was already fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinemas . &quot;
XI a pleasure to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy must open themselves wide towards the outside , to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping , on Tuesday , a group who was commissioned with the steering . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should devote himself to foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business divisions , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; new start @-@ ups for promoting and reforms will bring new momentum and vig@@ our , and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the management group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to establish border controls , promoting the border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population @-@ mel@@ de@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not identified for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it ensures greater role in the access of resources , an independent state @-@ of @-@ state business environment and the market is open , called the statement . &quot;
the government will also al@@ locate controls on the powers transferred to the Company and ensure that companies decide how they manage their operations .
&quot; the statement also said that China border @-@ areas will permit , new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; in order to get the requirements optimized and the application process will be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities exercise , and establish professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , were reported as reported in a statement after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury line in predat@@ ory food
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large @-@ fish species and thus consumers have a considerably higher dose of nerve awareness .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is presenting a corresponding paper plan for the EU , critici@@ zed the plans at large : &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ related policies are passed on with full power to pregnant and infants , &quot; &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t has been recognized by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , according to that , the threshold values of the nervous poison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ per or s@@ word@@ fish from an &quot; economic reasons &quot; can be raised by one to two milli@@ gram Mercury . &quot;
&quot; great car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore , however , are already bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury , that about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the border values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ verse . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU urged the boundary values to other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram on 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram Mercury per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch did describe this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low , that they already keep the planned maximum levels already today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation in cl@@ ei@@ c therefore is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de maneu@@ ver , which helps the economy to be &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is one of the people of high @-@ toxic heavy metals that over@@ sees itself above the food chain in car@@ ni@@ otic .
&quot; therefore the federal government warned that &quot; &quot; already small amounts of particular can occur particularly in the hard@@ ships of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Finance , however , explained in its homepage with regard to the current maximum levels but the state of health is not expected to be expected . &quot;
Mercury mainly comes from the coal burning into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture , the German coal @-@ national forces meet up by a written information from the Federal Ministry of Culture to the Greens party Ba@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ ck more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total in Germany em@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish for approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and surface spread &quot; in March , the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March quoted from paper . &quot;
last year across Europe @-@ wide warnings before mer@@ cury in fish already read the most common health risks during the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ System RA@@ S@@ FF .
F@@ ood@@ watch calls for consumers to protest against the plans of the EU under : www.@@ qu@@ eck@@ silver @-@ transaction .
