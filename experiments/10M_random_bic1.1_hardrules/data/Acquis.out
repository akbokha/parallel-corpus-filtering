in order to turn harmful effects of bacterial growth products in Plasma , blood sp@@ ends , the signs of a bacter@@ ium is not used ; the mort@@ gage has to be used in a blood amount of at least 10 ml .
in order to reduce the risk of the transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ atitis , they are not contain any more than 12 donations , or any other methods used to apply this risk in comparable way .
one of the liquid amount that one should be solved by the manufacturing of plasma cutting ; the substance must be solved within 10 minutes by 15 to 20 C .
the amount of plasma is dissolved in the water amount that was manufactured from which it was produced ; the solution is tested on the following tests :

the World Health Organization has developed for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood @-@ determination of the International standards and work for reproduction in other species .
a International Standard package includes a certain number of internation@@ alisation units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the Tit@@ ans which may be observed in individual diseases ( 1 ) .

the result is based on the label for dry reag@@ ents , according to the results of the re@@ ac@@ ousti@@ cs ; it is designated by the government authorities .
dry reag@@ ents are stored in a atmosphere of in@@ comparable gas or in a vacuum tank , and in the glass container where they are dried and the so closed that no moisture can penet@@ rate .

for avo@@ idance of bacterial growth , the continuous governmental administration may also be added that the Re@@ ag@@ ence ( or the anti@@ biotic ) is added to a anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or anti@@ biotic which is added to the conditions of speci@@ alty and eff@@ ic@@ acy .

the reag@@ ents , even if in fluid form or after re @-@ rede@@ mption , must be transparent , and must not contain neither se@@ di@@ ments nor joints or visible particles .
for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents , the blood group should not be colored as possible , at least as long as the International Convention have come into a uniform system .
Re@@ ag@@ enzi@@ en for blood group compar@@ es such ways , and in such quantities , that it is not only necessary to carry out tests with the unknown blood bo@@ oth@@ es , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative effects .
eff@@ ic@@ acy in a containers must be so big that the content of information can be used to carry out in this protocol in the eff@@ ort@@ ex tests .
the production of labor@@ ers has over all production levels and checks of re@@ generative diseases to the blood group of written consent .
proper samples of all specified reag@@ ents are so long from laboratory to store up to some probability that the Charge is no longer used .
the identification of the blood group used to produce substances , human , animal , bot@@ an@@ icals ( or mineral ) of origin , the others are the necessary tools to rein@@ force the effectiveness and conservation of the re@@ actor .
for technical reasons these re@@ visions are divided into three groups , according to the origin of their effective use in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin can contain human origin or herbal remedi@@ es cannot be contained in human origin .

in its second session , the Executive Committee adopted the necessity for the Convention on its second session on its second session , as well as the need for states that states with reduction of these emissions have already achieved their emissions limit values for nitrogen oxi@@ des , and check their emissions limit values for nitrogen oxi@@ des .
under consideration of existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their subsequent coatings on the environment as well as data on technologies to fight against emissions .
decided to take effective measures to fight and decrease the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their limit@@ ing flow values , in particular by applying the appropriate national emissions limit values , and by retro@@ fitting of existing sources ,
in the realization that the scientific and technical knowledge of these questions will further develop and that this development is to take into consideration when checking the application of this protocol and in the decision of further action .
