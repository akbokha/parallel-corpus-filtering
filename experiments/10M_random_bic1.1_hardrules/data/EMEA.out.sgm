<seg id="1639">The CHMP based on the base of security protocols of ADVOC, which is necessary for use of PSURs all 6 months, decided to apply to a further extension procedures for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008, Gendux Molecular Diagnostics Limited (CHMP) is officially admitted that the company expects his request to permit an authorization for an accident in the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus, the genetically so changes that it can contribute to the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus has a "Adenovirus" which is so changes that it is no copies of themselves and thus can solve any infections due to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Cexin would have to be heated directly into the tumours and to form the cancer cells to form normal p53 cells.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein that is formed out of the human body of existing p53 gene is usually made to recovery damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA is not restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Li-Women's cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein is not correct, and the cancer cells can continue growing and share.</seg>

<seg id="1648">* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing date, the CHMP has a list of questions that sent to the company sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, not sufficient, the injection of scalein in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also participated in the processing of the medicine by using in the body, the way to administration and security of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently proved to be manufactured in reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The CHMP did not assume any of the consequences for patients who are currently working on clinical studies or "Compassionate Use" programs.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified drug-release" means that the tablets are so summarized that one of the effective ingredients are immediately released immediately and the other slow down to some hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic Rhinitis (hypocrisy infections caused by an allergy against Pollen) in patients with nasal abrasive swelling (petrifugal nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal membrane (muzzle nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be carried out by cruning the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">Most important factors were the changes of the heavy tissue of the hay fever which was reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients had their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and measured with a standard skala, like hard the symptoms in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of all hypocrisy fymps apart from the constipation of the nose reported about 46.0% compared to a decrease of 35.9% compared to the patients' pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>

<seg id="2278">For children under five years of age, Alduraziland the GAG concentrations of the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children reported in the end of the study a normal liver.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of algae in patients at age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients), headaches, abdominal pain, skin rash, skin rushes, pain and reactions in the glish (in hands and feet), heat treatment, fever and reactions to infusion interface.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side-effects in patients with five years increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (accelerated heart rate), tungsten carts (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazym consists of patients who might react very sensitive (allergic) to Laroniomase or one of the other components (anaphylactant reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be well-known every year all the new information that may be known, and that summary should be at best possible.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazym will receive patients who observe the algae of algae in order to observe the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission opened the European Commission of Genzyme Europe B.V. an authorization for the transport of Albiaziland throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of humanities -L-Ibraonidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology with using recombinant DNA technology.</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazym is the long-term infringement of patients with secured diagnostic of a Mukopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazol should take place by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other metabolic disease.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazol at adults over 65 years has not been obtained, and for this patient cannot be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of algae cells in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been obtained, and for this patient cannot be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazym treated patients, patients can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as each in relation to the fusion of infusion or until the end of the Infusion Tour (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Albiazome should take place in a reasonable clinical environment in the revitalisation of medical emergency cases.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study is expected that nearly all patients IgG-antibodies are formed against laroniferase, usually within 3 months from the treatment beginning.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, antibodies or symptoms of infusionist reaction, must be treated with caution (see Secure4.3 and 5.7).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because little experience concerning the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, must be careful because of the increased risk reduction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (anti-histamine and / or antipyretika) to minimise the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium hard-resistant reaction, the treatment with anti-histamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen, and / or a reduction of infusion rate, in half of the infusion rate, in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of individual, severe infusion reaction must be brought to infusion, the infusion may be brought to decrease, treatment with anti-histamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be recorded with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, which is recorded in response to the reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are used (antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprops and / or corticosteroids), as well as reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, in which the preceding reaction is detected.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazym should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interaction with intracellular connection of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">The experimental studies cannot be found on direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / oale development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As a result, no data at Neuborn, which were exponated towards Laronidase over the mother's milk is recommended, while the treatment with Aldurazome is not stigated during the treatment with Aldurazome.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were discussed as infusionary reactions caused by 53% of patients in the phase-3 study (treatment period up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment period up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesired drug interactions in connection with Aldurazym that were observed during the phase II study and their extension with a total of 45 patients (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history, beyond, heavy reactions, including Bronchospasm, respirrel and facial expressions (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesired drug interactions in connection with Aldurazol, which were reported in the age of 5 patients with a total of 20 patients in the age of 5 years, were reported in the age of 5 months, were reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg invenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous all 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most cases, patients came within 3 months after the treatment for a seroconversion, while the patients died under 5 years after the age of 5 days (average after 26 days after 45 days at age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">According to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature expiration of the study), 13 / 45 patients are not detected by Radiokanophrenia (RIP) ascertainment antibodies, including 3 patients, where it was never too busy.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with inferior to lower antibodies - a robust reduction in the GAG Spiegels in Harn, during patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase-3 study and one in the phase-2 study) showed a marginale to low neutral inhibitory effects on enzymatic laronize activity in vitro, which could not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the intraocular undesirable drug reactions, even if the occurrence of undesired drug reactions occur usually with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme treatment lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulation of the substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and of cells in Lysosomas, most likely the most likely about Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The security and efficacy of algae were formed in a randomised, doublinding, placebo-controlled phase-3 study at 45 patients in the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recalled by the study, the majority of patients from the middle phenomenon, and only one patient was treated with severe phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had an integral expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the provisioned change of expected FeV and the absolute speed of the 6-minutors.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently tested for an open label-extension study, where she received additional 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 e / kg Aldurazym.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks therapy was treated with Aldurazym treated patients with the placement of lung function and the ability to be depicted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open-extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazym / Aldurazym group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazym group, as follows from the following table.</seg>

<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of GAG-mirror in Harn (µg / mg Kreatinine) was established until the study period remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In addition to the heterogeneous cases of disease between the patients, the clinical significant changes were taken into consideration by using a combined final result (compared to 14 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%), no change in 10 patients (20%) and a decrease of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was conducted in an open phase 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and Pharmakokinetics of Aldurazol at 20 patients were examined at the time of their intake in 5 years (16 patients with severe confluence form and 4 with the mean follow-form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">Four patients had increased the dosage due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">With several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with severe conformulation form, whereas in patients with severe conformulation form, only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
