met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata are defined in accordance with your definition data , information about or documentation of other data that can be managed by a application or environment .
I have to say that if you don &apos;t have more than 1000 photos on your computer , you need not only need to know how many photos you have , then do not want to save many pictures . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then do not use the met@@ adata from a database as well as in the image files , which can be easily access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first you do to do and know what kind of your system integ@@ rates to your computer structure . you must decide whether you want to store them on a local drive , or on a network setup &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . you will be happy with this structure . you will be able to organise a few times a few times on the same location . if you have enough photos , then you &apos;ll be sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for you to print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements such as version of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % working files and you will not re@@ organize your structure for these contents .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the pile processing easier . separate the new files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a safety strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for a original or a expi@@ ration picture .
we also recommend the option of met@@ adata in the site of the met@@ adata . if you forget this , then you can save the met@@ adata from the database to the files , then select the met@@ adata from the database .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change your met@@ adata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts now , because you need to assign a review to every photo gallery , and you can then select all images that will require the same attribute and then press the value . this makes sense , because you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
take a look at other programs often , or categories , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you import cat@@ alog@@ istic pictures from another source with embedded key data , the tree is not able to build the tree for you . it is not a problem and can simply be done by using a sub@@ strate to another . &quot; &quot; &quot;

you don &apos;t want to see your photos just because you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure that you are interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . from a distance it is not even a nice beach club . if you see it closer , start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha beach quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing .
for others the title is probably more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you see pictures , you should tell a story . remember that the key is the meaning of the viewer to understand Him about what you need to understand what you understand .
it is not perfect if an image is not perfect if the strength has only with a circum@@ ference for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation , you can also export a number of images simultaneously in a internation@@ alized alph@@ abet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , you will be exp@@ orted to your wishes and / or the title of the web galleries in web galleries .
remember the times before GPS ? if you have to find out in a different city without navigation system , it was not a tedi@@ ous planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , than with pictures , the train is now with light speed .
the possibilities of Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already in@@ ti@@ ghtly and become even deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can export your travels through photographs .

of course we will not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or Neg@@ ative . in this section you can get problems with so @-@ mentioned new media .
Kro@@ ll On@@ Star , the largest data recovery concept of the world , has some interesting statistics for the reasons for a loss of data loss .
in order to learn the problem at CDs / DVDs have to be treated just as a few years . of course , you may also be able to get more difficult than a few years .
CD / DVD dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in the right way and store them on the right way and store them to the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more complicated than the che@@ apest way but you write much reliable . it revol@@ ves around the right .
CD and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you just have just been written . because of this massive protection against the form@@ atting and the control hum@@ id they are needed by chemical reactions , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there are a che@@ apest program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that comes with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is also not available for Mac@@ s . there is also similar applications the damaged data from damaged disk drives , hard drives , Flash media , USB drives , etc .

on the other hand , you can read the media with a description , date and author , and then store the media with a description , date and author , and then return to a clean , dark dry and before animals . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest version of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing erg@@ ents include a new Disk , but not the data .
during the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C , the most common temperature ranges from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temperature fluctu@@ ations , the most common error occurred , S@@ MAR@@ T can not notice this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T termin@@ ates the defect immediately .
this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a current rating before you may want to recover the files without any big problems .
while most electric appliances are not so successful , the devices with computer chips and high@@ speed processes are different . these can cause serious damage . on your computer can cause serious damage . your computer can cause serious damage . your computer can cause serious damage to your computer can cause serious injuries and other defects . protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a tool that absor@@ bing a part of the energy storage and the rest . it is usually in shape of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every plug @-@ in is also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then please make sure that it protects the UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also note that he protects the protection against lightning and thus protects the right devices .
because an over@@ voltage of each cable can use any cable to your computer , you should be sure that all peri@@ pher@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms , which can also be connected to your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the television card .
if you have an not@@ ebook , you will require a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore they are also the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for your trip .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system will protect your system above small fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not help you to invest in a complete loss of unwanted data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a low @-@ free supply .
in addition to protection against excess extensions , these devices can be automatically run automatically when a power loss . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and the system . if you have a UPS , you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
concerns the potential risks associated with your computer system and compare with the costs for this . a high level of high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be reduced by up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a smaller price difference if you think about it .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . using the right configuration you can use this as drive to &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use these as a backup target for your software .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
solutions are therefore only the solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general safety solution . it is too slow .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , photo ( Yahoo ) and photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com offers online storage services that are available to you . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not want to get your pictures not in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the Web solutions are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol , and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission ratio in the machine . all the transfer is sus@@ cep@@ tible to transfer errors . the file system sends and b@@ tr@@ fs at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells us if a transmission does not occur in your hardware . it &apos;s quite un@@ distur@@ bed that there is no protection against you . it &apos;s pretty sure that there is no protection against your computer . no one seems to be thought about it . the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer database away than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transmission ratio as they create inter@@ rup@@ tions within the data streams . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not interested in transfer technologies , you should look at the future . in 2010 , you will see a lot of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates with record loss , and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard .
Oracle has its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still used in the Alpha status . it is still used in the Alpha status . it is also used for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
you don &apos;t understand this , these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses , with not@@ ebooks and 46 % at the work@@ load . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of the theft will be 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most common . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft , or new installations , and it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is a minim@@ ally better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rup@@ ts data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during surgery is higher and a un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main cause for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 bl@@ ess@@ ings of a fundamental physical limitations . meaning that technology has further developed a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise character@@ ization for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border .
today cameras are available in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . the sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optim@@ ally important for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a maximum size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive today have been responsible for 100 &amp; euro . so you do not backup any other data loss in any year of data loss . so you save your data often after a plan and test this backup before you use any more dangerous as the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change from hard drives .
do you use daily your backup on an external SATA drive . if one day , a flash maker you &apos;ve been associated if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a des@@ aster must be local and destro@@ ys a lot . do flight routes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft , are usually a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , des@@ titu@@ te does not require local storage . do you bring the stairs to the stairs , in your neighborhood house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above above is a common reason for a data loss in spite of backup the Pan@@ ic . if you have a backup , that is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a mom@@ entary recording without hist@@ ories and provides a complete copy at one point .
differential protection : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete complete backup process . the complete moments of the complete protection and the last difference .
incre@@ mental security : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can easily integrate the original status to any time . this backup comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ary system on the next to which it is only ab@@ ast@@ et and no longer .
sync is a wonderful tool that you can set easily on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer Auth@@ entic@@ ing sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens to compressed and when you want to increase your safety via s@@ sh .
backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another op@@ posi@@ tional medium .
this procedure will give you enough time to discover losses and make use . at the same time , you have a complete day of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly mom@@ entary recording for at least one month and a mom@@ entary recording for every month . each other output should be done , after which you have made a complete test .
topics : met@@ adata , in the image file stored , associated X@@ MP files , original files , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ use of images and met@@ adata , copy of images on the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the internet .
with this valuable pictures you will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time period in you are really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future due to your nature un@@ predi@@ ct@@ ably you need to know everything today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain stor@@ ms . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to evaluate as the current system back@@ wards .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays for everyone . if you have an old system that you should know about your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other side , the Council is quite simple : jed@@ es@@ times if you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay on open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually to enlarge .

open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not have software anymore , you can create this yourself by year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that is slow from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard . it is los@@ sl@@ ess , supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata . it is los@@ sl@@ ess , supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression sal@@ ms ( default late ) . there are many different types and not all applications can work with all types of applications .
DNG The Digital Bet@@ ative file format is a license free and open source format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obliged to use the camera in the format .
this is probably one of the reasons why to replace Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology , which allows users to embed their data in a file itself . X@@ MP is a label of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . it is a key component of XML and R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers go to a original of your recording , mostly in raw format , but can come back separately from the image file . it can be used to use the met@@ adata between the met@@ adata and the image file , and how you use the raw format , so you should consider it if you use DNG as containers and keep it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that allows for fully compatible online met@@ adata standards that provides an extensive range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI system , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures of the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images on the camera , you can use this as temporary f@@ use .
you are currently converting foreign files to DNG and save it in your document archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a hostile machining , you can use external programs . if you have the images again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed pictures for the copyright right with a digital water@@ mark . export it to MPEG , use in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ful ; in the section execution of a photos you can add images that you have already installed on your hard disk .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; connect to the camera , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start to connect the camera interface to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig -@@ 4.0 can be displayed on the bottom of the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol for extensions for every file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you need to download the photos on your computer , you need to view the camera information about each entry . using the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can view the properties of a contract or met@@ adata .
this dialog shows a file name and photo information that is saved by the camera . a symbol demonstrates that the image has not been stored on your computer . note that the image is not available to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available at your computer .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the easi@@ est way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button . download the photos of their camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ to .
if you want to download all photos you want to download and download the selected images , select the button to download and download the selected images .
if your camera is supported , the option is available for the new version . these pictures have been selected from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ful ; available in this case the new images were selected with a star in the front panel . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will only be downloaded .
if you use the buttons to download or download the selected folder , the list of existing albums will be sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the section of your albums . then select the target album from the list and press it .
after which you selected the target album , press the OK , and the digi@@ ti@@ zation ; invites the photos of the camera in the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all on once again by clicking on the button to delete the button button . if you want to delete it , you need to select the selected images and delete the selected images .
note that there are no way to recover pictures you have deleted from the camera . you should not be aware that the photos will be successful in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer of &amp; k@@ de ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should not be aware of the camera &apos;s camera , because this is much faster .
cameras are used as a file name for the photos often not supported . the fil@@ en@@ ame will usually upload , if you have deleted pictures of different recording files in the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for dat@@ ac@@ tion@@ . if you use these default option automatically , a folder will be created automatically .
the options as the transmission doesn &apos;t open three additional options that are stored , before the photos will be stored on the disk . if you select it , the corresponding entries will be copied out of the Photo database . the last option you can download date and time for all downloaded images .
if you want to use another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix f@@ oto@@ - % Y@@ - % d % H : % S : % S : % S . for further modifications , you should read the option &amp; time .
if you use the option to use the camera file you have the option to modify the file name in small letters . or in large numbers if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation , is shown below the name , is below the name , the camera is displayed in a preview . their settings are stored and automatically used if you open the camera &apos;s next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ful ; it can be used to perform all the information about the camera &apos;s point of time to perform a automatic rotation during the process . not all cameras are ready to use this information . in the section bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on and when you want to switch to this information , the picture in the original orientation . if you want to switch the button extension , use the button extension and choose the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made using the date of which the photo has been made , it is possible to create sub@@ missions in the target album . not all cameras are based on the same album . not all the cameras are available on the same album . not all the cameras are available on the same album .
this option is usually switched off and recorded in that case . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . if you want to change this option , you will use this option to switch the button to the bottom end of the window .
the easi@@ est way to upload their camera to your camera is der@@ thread@@ ed Download . choose then upload . the file size dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you select the files you want to select the uploaded files . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is requested , I asked the images to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press the OK button to load the upload .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as general term in this document . this is a position which can be shown in length and width sections , which can be shown on a card . the identification of the data can be shown by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , European G@@ ALI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers . not everyone uses an air@@ plane to associate an area through automatic recording of the GPS information . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agencies can use this ability .
if you forget to forget where exactly the photo , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation , you want to locate the location of the photos you want to locate the location of the photos .
the question is how the GPS data is supported in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has a number of GPS data fields such as the direction , saddle and card references . the question is actually more than the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic orientation ( manual ) and last over the manual input of well @-@ known locations .
as far as we know it is currently no camera which has a GPS unit , but there is a few who work with GPS receiver , either as a card module or by means of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh
the download of the GPS data from one device can be stored with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to store these data but in the G@@ PX format because this is the only format that support the module to ge@@ ographic orientation .
there are various programs for Windows , and Mac OS that can extract the data from images and from GPS ; make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length of the length and widths or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harvey . it uses the pre @-@ mark coordinates , e.g. from map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street types . here are some European websites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Gam@@ er ; try to give you much more control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that lay the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; in order to set up the Settings dialog . you can select between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left page .

the page Settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse is in main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which data types and digi@@ ti@@ cide , you can add the file extension of this list and remove it .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the button actu@@ alize on the right of each category .
the adjustments of the ligh@@ thouse of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can be set on this page to the standard values . if you use the ligh@@ thouse , these settings are not available .
by default you can select a black background behind the original photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select the tool bar when you use the window in full screen mode .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that images in a higher resolution of light density can be coded as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the upcoming explanation .
with the setting of PNG comp@@ ress you can reduce the size of PNG file . this surgery does not reduce the image quality , because it does not have a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and un@@ pack . if you have a quick machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option TIFF files , you can switch the Def@@ eat -@@ compression sal@@ mist for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it has no influence on the image quality because the Def@@ aul@@ ted algorithm is used freely .
with the setting loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can simply save los@@ sl@@ ess setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size much better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph , met@@ adata was not supported , but was not supported in the planning .
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the jQuery Slider window . you can drag the images ( folder ) to the jquery slider with swf jQuery Slider window .
the default pattern is that all green pixel are identical to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss in the output . if you use this option , the image is a little soft , eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tery pattern with the V@@ NG@@ K or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white print is used in the camera . otherwise , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only when the white is not set correctly . standard is a fixed color balance that has been photograph@@ ed on a white map that has been photograph@@ ed on a white card .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super Technology SL@@ R cameras . the effect of the second sensors has the effect that supp@@ ressed images in four steps more details can be ignored . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the Spitz@@ ing@@ ter , so the parts of your images have been embedded in the settings of your camera , as a continuous white to the settings . if you want to solve the fine white in the settings , you can also use some unusual results since they try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the missing information .
this is possible because blue pixel is generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ yst@@ w will try to re@@ construct the missing green and red volumes from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how many color or white you want .
if you select option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set up a level of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image .
if you have to set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you need to be probably more higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ Cap algorithm is a digital image process to provide a complete picture of the sub @-@ filter image sensor which displays many cameras and a matrix @-@ color pixels available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ ent ; and D@@ z@@ anne uses three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number from gra@@ dient ) , the first algorithm was created to me and those used by me used . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number from gra@@ dient ) was interesting when you search a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lens , you can use the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour correction , as you can be performed during the raw @-@ converting .
a profile analyzes the color information and instructions how to be given . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ ti@@ ful ; information such as the colour information from a colour gam@@ ation to others , so that colors can be as accurate as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider online or to a local drive for testing you should go to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gallery / Publish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the input profiles should be used to use the camera manufacturers and model that you do . not all profiles are available on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain colour images or gam@@ ma correction . it means that you need to perform the color of the file itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Proof profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image from one device has been given . this is very useful before you print a smaller color range than your camera and some colors . this could be corrected instead of being able to leave you on the blin@@ king algorithm for your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . unfortunately , the table of cameras and profiles are fit together . this answer is of course an officially recognized :
the Canon profil@@ ing can be seen the style for the objective : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neut@@ ron , P for portra@@ it@@ ments and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is that &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin interface . it is a interface that supports from a number of &amp; k@@ en ; image editing and image processing is supported by the deployment of this interface and supports many modules that have been written to work with each program that the K@@ IP@@ I interface can work together with each program .
if your distribution is installed on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use and this will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ to . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main menu and also , you will find some also in the context menu of the preferences .
short command of tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu of the menu settings in the menu .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I project , you can get about the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ gin@@ s.@@ org or in the Hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the scope of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image outputs , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other sei@@ z@@ s turn off the met@@ adata from the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics present on the left @-@ hand side of all of the cameras . on the right side , a camera is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is connected to the computer .

this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mostly found it mainly of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed implementation .
the reason why you have a coloured workflow integrated into the colors of your camera or sc@@ anners have a predi@@ ctable devi@@ ation from the fact that you can print out the colors of your camera or sc@@ anners and the colors that meet you with your camera or sc@@ anners .
if the topic of color management is coming , everybody wants to press and press the results of the results . unfortunately , colour management must be available to each point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , the sense of this tutorials is to give you sufficient background information about ink administration . in addition , you will be able to make your own inform@@ ational choices that you will receive the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows all six below is fulfilled , you must not take care of colour management .
you are working at a monitor of the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image issues are based on e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
if the RGB so well works and the life for all so easy , why should you use another colour gam@@ ut and do not need to make thoughts about color p@@ aces ?
a visual example of the le@@ RGB compared to the colors which we really see below is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fei@@ ts @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the RGB colour gam@@ ut , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour surfaces , you visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ c VAT and click on information and then click Information About the RGB contents .
if I want to reset my monitor if I decided to work with the RGB colour gam@@ ut .
Yes ! if you work in the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ma or not , you need to reset your monitor if the RGB function is reset , then you need to insert your monitor on the s@@ RGB template .

this tool represents five automatic correc@@ tions that may improve the image in most cases . if you use it , before selecting a further manual process .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same as automatic and contrast contrast from the menu Kor@@ rig@@ ation Automatic correction are automatically deleted from your color . they are to experiment with these effects . they are like to experiment with these effects . they are like to see what &apos;s best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is scal@@ able with the entire image , so that the dark spot is black and the light point as light as possible without its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or low .
at the same time this method supports the ligh@@ thouse of the selected images , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m &apos;s intensity is as flat as flat as flat as possible . this has a very good results when improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes there is also a very powerful operation which can either be found in an image or it destro@@ ys .
automatic loading : this method is maxim@@ ized to the color range in the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ int . you obtained the dark and bright borders of red , green and blu@@ epr@@ ints on the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of a picture by means of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ bs of all values . this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the White bordered of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white tor@@ ch of a photos .
the white ab@@ ject correction is somewhat limited because of a colour gam@@ ut with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can work out far from the original picture . if you can work out from the original picture , in case of the white mode , your possibilities are going to be better .
this tool is based on a white degra@@ dation algorithm in the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. Joch@@ anan . it will start using the Menu to the Gold page and you can drag the images ( folder ) to the top of the page .
the display mannequ@@ in can be adjusted in size . you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will see dynamic the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original version , it will then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview photos features a red Mar@@ ker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
on the top of the top , a hist@@ ogra@@ m is shown that dynamic changes will change when you bet an parameter . you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , cal@@ ories and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the sc@@ attend@@ ance of your photos or also .
check the above mentioned above mentioned , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white content . this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the white back with the list of the settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ power indi@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is displayed . this is shown as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
in order to store the buttons as well as loading this . any setting of the white , you can save you in a text file and later re@@ load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button allows the filter values to your standard values and the related neutr@@ ality . note that neutral settings will be another different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can set the encoding depth of each color channel of the selected images . 8 @-@ bit code is the widely available JPEG format , 16 bit code is better for high quality images . this code is needed , but also more disk space , computing time and can be done for the formats PNG , p@@ nm , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the machining of raw images . it uses the change and transfer of colour profiles . a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be applied to the use of color profiles .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors audio channels . this tool provides a built @-@ in menu to adjust several colour channels . this is useful when your camera or your scanner are always use the same error and you always do the same correc@@ tions in the manual you need to find more information .
a very powerful possibility for correc@@ tness is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the product portfolio includes four colour effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ otechnik filter , a Ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter .
in times of the chemical processing , solar cells , even Sab@@ ati@@ er was called , a effect of a short flash , and after the development of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ ligence of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ ligence of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect on this interesting effect .
the intensity is controlled by the solar cells . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is to create a negative image that is not to produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar generator . the original image is the ( 1 ) and edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filters simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aque ; -@@ effect . it differs from a s@@ cour@@ ing that he makes a stronger contrast effect that he makes the colour brilliant and smooth . try it , he runs many photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ et ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ et ; and a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors , but also some photographs which are hardly surprising .
the Ne@@ on@@ filters simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contra@@ sting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the layer of repeti@@ tions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ ite . in large images the filters can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for one moment .
digital cameras have common problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to change the colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu . as soon as you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
when you make a photo of bad lighting , you can reduce the reverse problem : there is a great choice for Bright@@ ness / S@@ ät@@ tel . also in this case the tool allows you to see in a preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated for improvement of the exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool is very complicated , you need to explain what you &apos;re looking for here .
the window contains a gra@@ phs of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active edge or the selected area . under the gra@@ phs below are three sliders into the bottom and be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left @-@ left hand represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the simpl@@ est way to learn to learn the control is the regulator to move the regulator .
on the right side you can see the original and preview of the picture . the preview will be dynamic , using the settings of the picture , updated on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogra@@ m is represented by a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera is common , the linear depic@@ ting of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar .
three regulator : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright sounds and the middle for the middle tones , often gam@@ ma values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image in order to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , middle and bright colours automatically .
output values : the output values allow to change the selection values for each area . the compression values can be used to change the output values for example . the compression values can be used to create the output values for example . the compression values can be used to create a hidden picture as background .
automatically : the image values are set automatically , depending on the intensity values of the picture .
save as and load : using these buttons can be stored in the file system and later re@@ load the Gim@@ p levels .
if you use these mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will be automatically detected automatically for all shadows , means and solar panels . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want and click on the preview of the original image to insert the input values of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the option of an indicator is controlled all color channels to display over@@ flow pixel and to show you the results of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed .
below , an example of the adjustment parameters can be applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , half of the origin@@ als and the target is displayed . the preview will be dynamic in dependence on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fied Channel : this sel@@ ector box allows the channel to allow the channel to change the module .
in addition to this box , two symbols are recorded by linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images with a digital camera , usually the linear mode of the linear mode is the logical mode of the linear mode . in this case it helps the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode .
if you move like a cur@@ sor to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that this bright tones with dark output levels and the associated image noise can be dar@@ ker dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos you will see a red mark on the field . if you want to change this marking on the curve , a matching line on the curve shows the original value . create a point on this line and move it up , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : using these buttons , you can configure exactly this . each curve can be stored in the file system and later be charged . the file format is the Gim@@ p Short ven@@ format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ ckers automatically generate the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , Central and Sonn@@ ent@@ ö@@ ne . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blu@@ epr@@ int and l@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the option of transfer indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to over@@ hau@@ led pixels . if in more than one channel , it is an indicator that you get the effect only in a preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed .
below , you can see a black white photo that was placed in the lumin@@ ance canal . shadow and Sonn@@ ent@@ ö@@ ne was applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag the images ( folder ) to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . you can drag the images ( folder ) to the top of the page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Privacy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the jQuery Slider window . you can drag the images ( folder ) to the top of the jQuery Slider window .
with the channel spac@@ ing box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you an initial reference to you by using the relative distribution and distribution . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to their own rider .
the preview of the target is a red Mar@@ ker . when you positioning this in picture , a vertical line is displayed in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controller for Red , Green and construction allow you to combine these channels . if you also keep the corresponding colour components , this is especially convenient if you also enable the corresponding colour components . this is especially convenient if you also enable the corresponding colour components . this is especially convenient if you also enable the appropriate color components . this is especially convenient if you are also the option of mon@@ och@@ rome . this is a great tool for creating great black white conversion of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black or white portra@@ its .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a visible space , which looks like a visible space , which looks like a colour channel which looks like a colour channel . if this is the case you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rome . in this way you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rome . in this way you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rome . in this way you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rome .
save as and loading buttons are exactly used for this purposes . any kind of mixer selection can be used for later and then load . the use file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of an indicator is controlled all color channels to display over@@ flow pixel and to show you the results of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed .
below , you can see a photo in the Blue channel . the option lens is activated . the original picture is activated under ( 1 ) and the worked image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating to be converted because of their abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white one step step , as colour images can easily be converted to the machine . also with a set of film @-@ roll profiles .

green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film illumination with a green line filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portra@@ its against heaven . thus , like the 004 c@@ ok@@ in ( tm ) green filters .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film illumination with a orange line filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( tm ) .
Rot@@ filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film illumination with a red lens filters . this creates dramatic effects and can simul@@ ate dramatic effects of day @-@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( tm ) Rot@@ filters .
the yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film illumination with a yellow Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and so similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( tm ) .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while he add a bit cold in the shadow plane . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and the re@@ generation in a sep@@ tum . this is typically for the photos of your grand@@ mother and so similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation ; tool texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
if you can use a text search on your image , regardless of whether it is a colour image or not , you can look like a oil painting on a screen , a pop Art portrait made of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image text can be used for example .
relief : move this parameter to the right hand , the bottom of the depth or three dimensions of the texture on the image .
a paper text is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed below ( 2 ) .
you can also add product news , press releases , events and vac@@ ancies completely free of charge
the eye of a viewer &apos;s eye to keep the limits of a photos is no easy task . it is an opportunity to keep the image a decorative frame . this is an psychological barrier for the spre@@ ader . under the frame , the module can be started using the window .
type : with this parameter , you set the frame type for your image . with a thin line , riv@@ ep@@ ce cover it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , embos@@ sed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : are the width of the frame in percent . the value segment is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the frame design is larger than the original , but the same side effects are bigger . this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you have used the tool after the page .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text in a picture . this is also important for several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text area , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its properties as you need them . you will simply choose an frame to select the text and / or a semi transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . after the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation , tool , you can specify a template for a picture .
or you can drag the images ( folder ) to the jquery gallery with swf jQuery Gallery window .
there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format and to work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation .
if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your range folder with the button square folders . select the folder where you are copied to the highest folders . these settings are created for the next launch .
after the root folder for the set was set , the folder structure looks set . the selection of a folder can be updated and automatically updated the fores@@ ee@@ able bar of the set .
you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your picture .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fies the window . it will be c@@ entered into the position of the mouse . check it with the mouse button .
reducing the corresponding image . if you want to use the mouse into the picture . if you want to use the mouse on the whole image , you must scan the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move the button to move the picture below to move the picture below . use the picture and add it to the desired position .
if you want to use the template to apply for your picture . the picture will be adjusted to automatically .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation , three different tool for car@@ bide saws . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pens is a traditional tool for car@@ bide . it is very quickly and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
Un@@ shar@@ k mask works on the contrast of edges to create an image shar@@ pen . it &apos;s no bit , it works better to remove the atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
Ref@@ oc@@ rine is probably the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures will require a correc@@ tional process . this leads to a common colour with just minimal differences . the same phenomenon allows sharp edges to be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras are usually more than normal cameras for private use .
using JPEG image , a camera is often applied to a camera . pictures in raw format you need to be moved during processing .
some sc@@ anners are already installed during the image of the picture . if you de@@ activate this de@@ activate , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you may find useful results by clicking on a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool .
it should be careful because the results are not very natural : the focus will be increased the edge of the edges , but also the noise . in general , it is the most expensive technology for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of a picture of Ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ es . you can reach further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too scar@@ ce . the solution to record the picture a bit soft is much easier than it . use the tool for soft to shar@@ pen and experiment with settings . the buttons on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp edges is a very good tool to remove sli@@ pping from your photos . a demonstration allows you to see here .
the original image and preview can help to edit the image . the device display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the Radi@@ us and the amount . the default values are often generate good results and should first be used . if you create the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask , smo@@ kers and the impression of dim@@ ples are placed in the proximity of sharp edges .
the Radi@@ us produces a like many pixels on each side of each side by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radius . you should therefore shar@@ pen images at the best in their final resolution .
the amount specified between the original and the wi@@ ches picture is added to the original . therefore the strength of the edge is set .
the threshold value is a breaking out of the maximum RGB value and apply @-@ to @-@ amount . it is possible to define a minimum difference between the tones from the shar@@ pen from the shar@@ pen@@ ing from the shar@@ pen and therefore the beauty changes in faces , heavens and water surfaces .
this is an example of the ir@@ radi@@ ated filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed by radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ value = 0.0 .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of digi@@ ti@@ zation is achieved by improving the edge of the tool . it uses the copyright protected protected Dis@@ cre@@ atic filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to make a picture of &amp; quot ; ref@@ using the Def@@ ok@@ ussi@@ es . this is a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . the traditional technique of images is achieved . Ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ es have achieved better results when you start using Col@@ ok@@ ussi@@ es in the window .
in the practice , the circular thread is much better than the pal@@ aces . the pal@@ ate &apos;@@ sche fro@@ gs has a very long tail , which leads far from the source . the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the pal@@ ate is influenced by far away from the original pixels .
it is the most important parameter for use this module . it is the most important parameter for use this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module .
cor@@ relation : an increase of cor@@ relation may help recover art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of noise filter can help you avoid arti@@ facts . however , the filter can be too low as 0.1 mg . however , the noise filter can be too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s focus : this is the radi@@ us for the Gau@@ ß . if you use this value to 0 , in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value to 0 , you may also increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ ous noise filter .
this value determines the size of the trans@@ former size . an increase of mat@@ ri@@ mal size may have a good results , especially when you select large values for the circular edge or the pal@@ aces . however , however , you should choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the saving and loading buttons are exactly used for this purposes . each other Ref@@ ok@@ ussi@@ an parameters will be stored for later and then loaded .
try all zu@@ cch@@ ini , colour and intensity of intensity and the intensity of the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before creating the picture . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but they leave a pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , ir@@ regul@@ arity is generally used as a focal point . this could be caused by the sharp edges of a larger neighborhood as an edge .
theore@@ tically , it must be impossible to remove arti@@ facts . even under the optimum conditions , it is never possible to remove the effect of imp@@ eding filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as well as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask . the FI@@ R III filter is often better with processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ mistak@@ able colour image must be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information about the methods of focus in digital photos you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulator of the area was dark@@ ened to generate a more natural p@@ up@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ink wra@@ ps allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool eye correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the required arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the induc@@ ing algorithm was developed by I@@ MAGE team of gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre @-@ settings to simpli@@ fy the restor@@ ations . the available pre @-@ settings are shown below :
if you want to use the filter settings for settings , you can use the rider clear@@ er and advanced settings .

re@@ profil@@ ing Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth , as a value close to 1 only in a direction . if you have a high value wav@@ el@@ ength or CCD ro@@ bb@@ ons , a high value wav@@ el@@ ength is a great value . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best to be close to a value close by 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this is defined as the maximum smoothing factor via the upper limit . set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
as a result , this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the greater it is necessary if a lot of noise . it is necessary if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ c effect , it is necessary higher than 3 .

the buttons can be saved as well as loading this . any setting from picture errors can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very quickly when work . it can take a very long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can use the calcul@@ ator at any time with the button tail@@ gate .
below you can see how many errors can be removed with Small Art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is made on a photo that created in Guatemala city with an analogue camera . the original picture is created under ( 1 ) and correc@@ ting image under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation is a very powerful tool to reduce vibrations . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is sel@@ ectable image filter available to remove marks and other arti@@ facts , i.e. from dust or hair onto the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ llas ; effects from books or magazines too .
if you need more information about sensor technology from digital cameras , you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot shows the typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gr@@ asp@@ ing noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need only the sub@@ window details and the lower window settings can remain in the default settings .
Radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the amount of filters per pixel , and the image is generated by the Radi@@ us area .
this value is set at the edge of the filter by the filter by the filter . if it is increased , you need to change the edges of the filters . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive Filter image details are no longer available and noise or lubrication .
edges : controlled the edge @-@ accuracy of the filter . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , you can remove it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts .
light density : controlled the fluor@@ escent toler@@ ances of the picture . we suggest you either to improve your color or light density in order to improve the image process by the details of the settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the picture . we recommend you either to improve your color or light density in order to improve your image . this settings does not affect the smoothing process of the settings .
gam@@ ma : controlled the gam@@ ma toler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark sections , which typically are stronger to increase .
absorption : controlled the adjustment of the phase angle . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius to variations of light . when it is increased , the edges are smooth , if it is too high , the noise and phase of noise can be removed to the edges .
store and store : these buttons will be used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later .
this is an example of how noise reduction your life can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture can be cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution that gives a little soft to shar@@ pen@@ er is much easier than an image to shar@@ pen@@ er . use the tool to make the soft tab on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation is definitely one of the most developed tools for pic@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
these filters are presented to you the opportunity to remove a lot un@@ desired arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the pal@@ ate &apos; replacement parts , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes in the digital , original or the digit@@ alized images , which makes the contents like it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tures . the texture analysis is developed with another tool , the imaging function of the gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ er ; - small standards that will be corrected on un@@ compressed image . this setting is to fix these problems .
the buttons can be stored as and store exactly this . any setting of photo restor@@ ations can be stored in a text file and later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very quickly when work . it can take very long and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can use the calcul@@ ator at any time with the knob .
below , you can see how a photo with equal noise is restored .. The module is applied to Il@@ ford ( tm ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with sensitivity of 3200 ISO .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old colour photo which has been removed with a scanner . the original picture is found under ( 1 ) and correc@@ ting image under ( 2 ) .
it allows you to access it with a CCD camera with a CCD camera , and it uses it to be removed with a CCD camera , and it uses algorithms from the pix@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ inson .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw , because many cameras are equipped with JPEG compression via a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel@@ --@@ and &quot; quot ; bright pixel@@ ated ; on a photo with an dark image @-@ tra@@ der method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the assistance via the Button . the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright colors . these are highlighted in the picture of the picture .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects .
first , as in previous section , you should find the right dark image to correct image . an automatic processing of the dark pixels will be used . note that this assistant is the last dark image and this automatically closes in the next session .
the picture area and preview will help you correc@@ ting the result . the device display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are raised in all fields of fields .
in order to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter . select the best filter method to see these pixel blocks . these are the following filters :
Dur@@ ability : it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels . the same color is determined by all def@@ aults in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimension@@ ally inter@@ pol@@ ation , this will be separately ordered separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all Pix@@ ies have a distance of 1 from Pixel@@ block , for calcul@@ ating a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear tu@@ bs ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are considered to calculate an bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to calculate the pixel in the block .
k@@ ub@@ ically : all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less can be pulled into order to calculate an bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to calculate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below , you can use the hot@@ line correction on a colour photo , from an def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture was enlarged by 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation is correct , a tool to adjust the Vign@@ ettes , i.e. lower corners , a picture .
wide variety of objects , especially in the middle and large photo format , often illumin@@ ate the whole sensor area is not even illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ ungs &amp; quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reach the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ objective will also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when you need to hold a factor 1.5 or 2 when blood filter , which should be necessary to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle objects , even with center filters , a hole of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise inc@@ ur@@ able effects through movement .
it is possible to simul@@ ate the effects of a C@@ enter@@ filter by digital cameras and film scanning , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the correct correction of correct filters and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter also controls the degree of light sensitivity at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which reduce the density of an aper@@ ture of 1 , or acci@@ dentally compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vign@@ ettes , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of a picture with the Vign@@ et@@ tier@@ ite correction reduces the light intensity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target audience with these options , as you need to increase the settings only .
if you want to use a fine new setup of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma / Gamma is zero and use the Gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ dation ; you can drag the Gra@@ dation from the menu .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ration correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the itiner@@ ary in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . an leu@@ k@@ ment and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of digi@@ ti@@ zation is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses to photographs . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from David Ho@@ yer .
this tool is working with geomet@@ rical distortion . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second ridge is treated to the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ vex form of the picture .
the co@@ effici@@ ents of the third Gra@@ des has a similar round effect , but it is not applied to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ effici@@ ents fourth gra@@ des corrected the remote corner opposite the second ridge . if you combine these two geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second gra@@ ding . with negative values can be corrected , and positive values occur .
corner : this value is controlled by the thickness of the sequence . this value is stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most lens , the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse element of the parameter .
if you are already our customer , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . :
bright : this value Adjust@@ ed the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustr@@ ates the dialog with a preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image , are stored and used when the next start is used .
the ton@@ er or ca @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all inc@@ urred or size changes . the best result is to cut this correction than all the first .
to help you find the best correction of this tool . move it to an important place , such as the sea floor or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot .
if you have an ca @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting picture of black corners have the resulting picture tool in the menu . you can remove it using the loop tool in the menu or to remove the zoom control of this dialog .
the next logical step for some moti@@ fs . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as recordings from front , frame and painting it is the perspective to correc@@ ting all angles in the picture 90 degrees .
this is an example of the ton@@ eigh@@ ty correction on a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and corrected image under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ har@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter is produced in the known Il@@ ford ( tm ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infrar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you do the red spelling with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can simul@@ ate two parameters for film @-@ gra@@ dient and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green past@@ ures are white like snow !
since the filter color comes to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs since the color information is missing .
this is an example of infrared phot@@ oc@@ ator applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original picture is found under ( 1 ) and processed image under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was placed on ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura to the top .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation is a simple tool to produce movies on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tri @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers of big silver tor@@ ner of the photographic emul@@ sion .
this image has a certain mood or seems to be back to the past . the treated image will get a timeless atmosphere of daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , shr@@ ub view , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator adju@@ sts the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are needed to apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you are more sensitive , you can filter the filter several times .
this is an example of the film bar effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO 1600 .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of oil production produces the appearance of a oil used . it is used to use a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of oil .
there are two regulator to affect these effect . the upper cap is between one and five of . thick brush are better suited for large images . remove the gl@@ ands or from the other side of the other side .
this is an example of oil paintings . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and processed with ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and Gl@@ amour 17 .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation was used to generate colour and intensity gra@@ dient to define a coal @-@ les@@ ome . the lines which the mark@@ ings are in the drawing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would like to submit what scene you would like to set up . this would be good images to start with this effect .
there are two regulator with a value of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower pitch the contrast ( gl@@ ands ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence depth . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity of intensity .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the digi@@ ti@@ zation of the company &apos;s products .
the digi@@ ti@@ zation of digi@@ ti@@ zation is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , which is not the most important on content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the filtering process . a value of 30 , meets 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example for the Grav@@ ur filter . the original ( 1 ) and the worked image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distortion @-@ protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
note : if the image is seen in cells , it can look like if it is considered by glass @-@ blocks .

radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ k : caught the image by rotation of the pixel to a focal point . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a rotating camera .
removing un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : caught the image to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back to the background .
moving to the image by horizontal movements of the pixel . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft feeling : caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is the ideal for compilation of romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ amour @-@ pictures or for a warm and subtle glow plugs .
protect the image from acci@@ dental damage to the pixel , and simul@@ ate the image by acci@@ dental shift of the pixel and simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a arbit@@ rary camera .
intelligent Un@@ ity : finds the colour in the picture and caught it without changing it without the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and created it with an average pixel value , new .
some effects may require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore change this calculation at any time with the button of the button .
the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen are a nice tool to make shelves on your image . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses a look of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n is protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Trop@@ ic size allows the size of the drops , it is often necessary to reduce the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size of small images . number of the number and the density of the drop . fish can change the visual effect of the drop on the picture .
you can also use a range of keys to keep the area free of shelves . use the tool to select the area , for example a face that should stay freely . if you start the filter shelves , the area is freely sel@@ ectable of shelves .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the worked image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this sample .
if you have the wrong orientation , you can turn it through mirror or turning into the right way . the tools can be used in menu to transform or transform regularly in the menu .
a photo bladder is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge image quality .
the large question is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture @-@ bub@@ bles and the details of difficulty ? how can you find the missing information you can find in a picture . how can you see the missing information or err@@ or@@ by ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is here , makes it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size using the tool size using the tool size . select the target values in the menu and enter the destination values .
the tool for the size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to avoid the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ation was developed by I@@ MAGE team of gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and will be shown below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; side effects : if this setting is activated , when setting the new size of the original shape of the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the greater it is necessary if a lot of noise . it is necessary if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ en@@ effect .
the buttons can be saved as well as loading . each inser@@ tion of photo can be stored as a text file and later will be loaded later .
photo shooting is very quick when it makes it , but it can take very long and a high CPU load after pulling up . you can easily pull the calcul@@ ator at any time with the knob .
you can see below an example of photo bladder by a small colour image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged photo ( 3 ) . the result ( 2 ) is the result of the linear dynamics to comparison .
the photo gallery is not just a common operation , but also a often under@@ estim@@ ation tool to create a picture . you can simply cut the mouse with mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the mouse . you &apos;ll see this right mouse only while you move the mouse .
if you look back again , the area of the photos will be cut off again . this way you can look for a good overview of how your photo is cut off . you can create a good overview of your photo by clicking on the corners of the right place .
you can also use the button window button to store the button button button in the tool box and the photo will be customized ( Ctrl ; + X ) . use the entries to save / save the photo .
in advance , you can change the size of the right side by clicking the mouse with mouse . the side effects that you have defined in dialog will remain in dialogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , you can specify the orientation as high format or cross format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross format of the width varies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that it is always possible to use a relative page ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you &apos;re centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom of the dialog , you can cut the maximum conversion between the top and shape the area to the largest possible , depending on the chosen base and orientation .
the tool must be cut to the side effects , depending on the image orientation ( horizont@@ ally or Vertical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data is saved in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will be restored and not the original image .
the settings of the compositions to help make it clear that you are better suited to your pictures . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle are based on the principle of the simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles is aligned in a similarly harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles to the di@@ agonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a part of the various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of an N@@ auti@@ lus shell or the aper@@ ture of a sun@@ flower . it occurs in all sorts of things which we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational Number of 180@@ 3@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it has been used throughout the ancient Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ eks , who use your images , buildings and even photographs .
the number of the fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i row 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 8 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 and etc .
the golden middle is more fluid lines when you make a picture . these tips are shown below :
the golden spir@@ als will bring your goal good results to get closer to your photos . compared to third @-@ third , this type of composition takes the look of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule are the rectang@@ les of the golden spir@@ als . it should be used to make the eye in the heart of the composition . it should be a line to be one line or different objects . it can be a line to be one or different objects . this something can be simply because without the eye , it will fulfill its function .
the golden tri@@ angles are likewise from the above mentioned gold spiral . in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , the sides of the sides are the sides of the golden rule . note that unlike the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not even equ@@ ar@@ able tri@@ angles . di@@ agonal to these lines can cause a static object dynamic .
if you use the golden tri@@ angles to create your frame , create a effect of professional photography dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try your image focal points and other visual information in the triangle . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach different .
the options are stored and reflect ; to reflect the harmon@@ ious sub @-@ structures .
with the corresponding colour , you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a image at any angle .
if you do a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are around a corner . you can also find this picture with the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the slide corners . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . the knob will be shown back on 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right side .
to your help you find the free rotation of a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse into the picture show you can move it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now check the angle as in previous section .
after you have a shot , you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to fix this is the function of the jQuery Slider window .
an elegant way to cut the image is the complete range . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing emul@@ ates the picture a bit after turning .
all per@@ sever@@ ance transform@@ ations are carried out for a fixed point of the above reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your picture . you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty areas which were created by transformation .
new height : shows the height of the new picture , including the empty areas which have created by transformation .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the valley .
at the right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the valley .
at the bottom left : shows the current angle in degrees below the lower left corner of the valley .
at the bottom of the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the valley .
after adjusting the perspective of perspective , the image is a bit so@@ iled . for individual adaptation is this effect small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible .
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the top corner of the jQuery Slider window . you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the tool is used to move a portion of the picture in a direction to the left and the lower part of the left . this is not rot@@ ational , the picture is broken down .
you can use horizontal and vertical angle at the same time . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on default settings , the angle is shown on zero back . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target is displayed on the right side .
to your help you will create a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the mouse button to fix the lines . you can use the tool to adjust your picture .
after you have carried out the picture , the image will be a bit caught . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible but two shots of the use is twice as long as you should avoid this .
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the top corner of the jQuery Slider window .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats from your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries are comp@@ elled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image form@@ atting with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available files in their system file . they will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; Gam@@ er ; shows only files in formats . this happens by the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be selected . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression modes on digital images . this is redund@@ ant information to save your image data onto a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there is better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JPEG when the same compression ratio . the 2000@@ er version can also save los@@ sl@@ ess if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw @-@ format format , you can read the format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw materials converter from JPEG . you can find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zation .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; support the shop of raw images only with the program d@@ us@@ w , which supported in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ cide . all the cameras can be supported at the web page of Dave Ber@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ alities which are supported by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . and , this formats can be downloaded and digi@@ ti@@ sed for the films .
go forward to the previously visited album in the book . you can only move forward if you went back back .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows the GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of a picture and edit the ge@@ ographic data will be stored in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ograph@@ ically in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo .
to protect your images with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS trace as XML file in the G@@ PX format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download the data for you from your GPS device .
the location of the location of cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead to a number of selected images with a GPS track .
select the images that you want to have cor@@ rel@@ ates in the main window and call the menu . to use a possible cor@@ relation about time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . this file contains of course the same time on the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded into an automatic cor@@ relation , the coordinates of the coordinates in red shows . GPS trace data are recorded in the GMT @-@ time . this can be done in the GMT @-@ time . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera system here .
the default setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation is a top devi@@ ation for the GPS times and camera body . the devi@@ ation of the devi@@ ation shall be assembled . the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds .
if you have any track data from a place for images , you can edit the G@@ PX file manually and add the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then add all images in this field .
options Inter@@ pol@@ arity and Differ@@ ence in Min. can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits and then press the button lab@@ eled .
the coordinates can be set with this dialog manually . this is useful when you have a number of photos on the same location . since the dialogue set the coordinates of a call to the next time you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found in the following map and will be set by clicking on the link below and enlarge it again . the amount must be selected from you . the amount must be selected from the card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS information to the pictures . here is a small script that ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses a pile of images with GPS information .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery of HTML pages to release the HTML pages . you can specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be exp@@ orted to the HTML pages . the character set is U@@ TF @-@ 8 in order to allow an best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four rider in which the settings can be adjusted to the settings . you &apos;ll only choose to select a large number of albums . you need to select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ chmark and the text of the HTML page will appear on the right .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout of each side . this rider is largely in@@ explic@@ able . the option to create an page will create an own page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be shown in the picture . otherwise , the image will be shown directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , shown in the picture .

&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; represents two ways to create HTML Web pages with your pictures . it is integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version will be integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create HTML with HTML ...
before HTML page you need to make some settings . these are described in the three areas , layout and goal . in the following , every area is described in detail .
first , enter the title of the over@@ loading and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example for this settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file will be created to see the export page . n@@ avi@@ e information can be found on the export page .
you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page . if you are aware that information can be displayed on the HTML page . if you are exp@@ orted all images from a party .
in this area you can specify how the HTML page will look like . most of the setup options are unique , which is why not specifically designed .
below on the page you can make different resol@@ utions for the pictures . thus , you need to view different resol@@ utions and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images , for example , a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site may change the resolution at any time or change the resolution at any time . it can also be your images with low resolution , which leads to a smaller transmission time .
in this setup area , select the various folder and the URL right where your website is saved .
best value for all your HTML files are a base folder and for each subsequent set is a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically updated when you select the folder . you can select either a folder or by K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if this is really all for viewer . if you select a URL to select a web browser , the URL you should select here , this folder should start here . otherwise the web browser will start the wrong folder .
this allows you to copy the HTML files even in the final folder you need to copy it manually . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are .
this is a sub@@ folder created all three on basic folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you define in output folder .
if you are looking for a family celebration , a conference or somewhere else , you would like to share your pictures with these pictures . if you have already started a lot of time , the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc .
make a copy of your images in a .@@ k@@ im file . this can import other files into your database . the image properties are being imported with Ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . it is to store whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is stored in the file , that you have created all images in the file , but the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can also add a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images that are found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the respective images are not found , the images of the URL you are looking for creating HTML files . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , dialogue for the exp@@ orting pictures you will receive via the file exp@@ o ...
the most important option of this dialog is to act whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three sel@@ ections options :
when the option to copy in the .@@ k@@ im file you &apos;ll have to copy the images in the same folder like the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ sch close to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; clear@@ er album ; the images automatically copy for you .
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal zip files . because most images were already with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is not worth sending files to compressed . if you want to upload this , simply select the option to comp@@ ress the export file .
the last option of this page is a maximum image size . if you want to send your friends Add images , you may not be able to send the pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file is very big . here you can limit the size limit , for example , that each image of the 800 pixel is high and wide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file ... select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import@@ ing your photo@@ album &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need to import and export the images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to import photos into the folder you want to import pictures .
it may be that you are looking for the category persons who needs to be imported from your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window that will be imported from the third dialog window , and the categories of these categories are to be found in your database .
in the fourth step , you can see the categories of the imp@@ ec@@ ular file with the categories of your current database .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .

since the modules can be used together with other applications , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Demo @-@ database can either be used with the demo command .
the applications that can be shared with K@@ IP@@ I can be very different , making it possible to work some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the draw@@ back if you &apos;re working with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also include K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications should not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules should also be delivered to a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :

once you have set the features on your pictures , you can edit or edit the images you edit , print or whatever you want to do . this is described in . afterwards you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and very features can be displayed in the previous view . if you click on the images , you can add image to the pictures after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
it is not stored with the image , but in the database . it can be done back later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can see a picture of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; water@@ mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the context menu . to stop the M@@ alen menu , simply select the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; you need to be able to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object in the wire modal .
you can also select multiple items at the same time , but not the under@@ score of one already selected object , because all objects have already been selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
are there a number of options , the following command ends will be integrated to the following position :
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
if you have changed features , click the turn to take this changes . if you have invalid values , a message with an error message is displayed , then click the input to turn and click the changes to cancel the changes .
if you enter the path to the P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup of dialog , you can insert the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the object .
you need to use the P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation .
when you edit a text or part of a texture , you can view a preview of the property view .
press preview of the text and a small example of the scene is indicated by the selected text , even if you want to figure out the whole text ( for example a text search within a text search interface and not the entire texture of the Map ) .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and adjust the position and direction to the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will be shown as a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for dial and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift with mouse within the entire window .
each object has a view@@ point of view . you can only see this value relatively , when they selected or to specify a total surface of less than absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility in the tool bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window @-@ section as default setting . the object tree and the view of the object characteristics are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window you may be like or if you need another arrangement , you can save them , and can switch between different folders .
in order to ensure a window above or under one block , go to the top of the top or bottom edge of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the lid on the right or left side of the view . the new view will be anch@@ ored in the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to arrange a number of views you want to arrange the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then change the views between the views on the map sheet of the map sheet .
the last possible windows are anch@@ oring and views are anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view of the connection , drag the lid on the desktop or click on the small to the left above the bottom upwards .
to complete a view , click the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can view additional views on the main window . in the menu , you can find entries for each kind of views . new views are floating , you can be anch@@ ored in the corner .
the current window enables you to save the window and save the window . it will be displayed where you can save the window position under a existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ew them . &amp; k@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dern , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version will not support this version .
to ren@@ ew the current scene , click the Symbol Ren@@ ame symbol to ren@@ ame the icon in the tool bar or select the menu in the view .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
if you click on the icon &apos;s icon in the click on the icon , or in the menu of the Mo@@ di Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened .
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , it is a name that can detect the characteristics of the mode .
you can select the width and height of the chosen picture . if you want to ren@@ ame a small area of picture , select the cruci@@ fix@@ ion section and enter the picture section into the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this is a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflector . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
when a picture is marked with only a beam of the pixel , different errors are often created . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or layer effects in curves and lines which are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this feature better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you are off Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbor@@ ing Pix@@ ies using the second method is adap@@ tive because each pixel is again split and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth of the calculated color values .
when you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray comes to the pixels . when the difference between the color values are calculated on 4 , the pixel is calculated on 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams to the pixels .
the difference between two pixels is calculated : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 stra@@ cts per pixel . when the difference between the color values the pre @-@ defined threshold , the pixel will be checked individually . the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted individually .
another possibility to increase the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the radiation process , J@@ it@@ tering . if you are off J@@ it@@ ching , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beam to avoid regular patterns .
the final adjustment for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflex . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use of light reflex port is calculated . it takes place very long to calculate the scene with this property .
on this map card you can set if the Alpha channels is calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have no object .
open a new window for the display of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console edition . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it is expected , you can find the reason for this .
to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene to import the Menu file ... and select a file from the dialog window .
it currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; nor does not appear to modify the full commands of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when import error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all noti@@ fications .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ rit and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source text in the editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source text in editor and draw it into the object tree .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ pr@@ s ; a scene ren@@ ew . usually it is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .

&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; looking for external files ( for example height field data ) into the P@@ ov@@ ray ; Photo libraries . if you are searching for files that are not in the folder of the scene , you need to register the path to these files here .
the second colour is used for the display of the selected objects .
the second colour is used for the display of the selected inspection points .
the color of the field for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the object by the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model . you can set up the structure separately for shifts , scales and rot@@ ations .
larger values suggest a more accurate wire model and thus a better appearance of the objects , however , require more time to ren@@ ew . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you need high availability of details , all wire model views are further divided , if the camera is using a extended projector . this feature is a better overview for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ew .
when you cli@@ cked on a wall behind the objects , a wall behind the objects is depicted . the wall is depicted in a chess boards of two adjustable colours .
when you cli@@ cked the floor , a floor is below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess boards of two adjustable colors .
if you activate the edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be set . more details on the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can create existing window sets or create new window documents . in the section window , you can create window documents and save windows .
the combination of default window configuration : shows all existing window regul@@ ators . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the selected window enables to start the program to start the program .
the list of the window sets displays all existing window sets . a new configuration can be extended with the knob and select a selected arrangement with the knob .
every window @-@ order will be identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list below the names shows all views on the selected windows display . new views you can select using the button to create and selected views with the knob .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ anch@@ oring the windows under the existing window , with card card and the view is not placed in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you &apos;re just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ v@@ ray ; and now you would like to follow any more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow any steps in this manual , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , under begin@@ nings very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should be carefully aware that you should compl@@ ain as a result only a black screen if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note this important rules :
if you set any camera , no rules can be used for the ren@@ ders as a result you will get a black picture .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
if you have any faul@@ ty installed , you see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , following the following window :
take a little time to learn the menu and to learn the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation you wish to get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will often use these menus and symbols are often use , so you should remember the menu and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu in the menu . so you can now see the scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene which you create . in particular note the view of the camera from the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object is now a new entry with the name of camera . if you click on the view of the view of the view , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation and P@@ ov@@ ray ; you can find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , but take note that the camera can change in the view point where you can change the target point of the camera . simply clicking on a control point and pull it to the desired point .
if you turn the button fastening or the input file , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you may also insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a fundamental method for the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er : actually it offers a sim@@ pler system . you can use an infinite level as a floor .
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed soon .
the wire model has now also shows the level at the moment , even at the moment only as limited place . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level runs through to the horizon .
in this case you will find that you can find the entry for the bottom , if you click on the icon + before the object . you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene , you should move the ground for the exercise as a unit below . do not change some of these parameters . select the shift and put the values as follows :
just select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose at a moment &apos;s moment .
in both cases you can select a dialog where you can select how the object is inserted in the object . you can see the name in the property view ( name = ground pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button figure , just see how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ment only shows a matt black material because you have to enter the look of materials anytime with a click on preview . please enter the colors for the pig@@ ment . also there are many options , but take the simpl@@ est way .
if you can see no color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button button and call the preview .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you want to ren@@ ame your picture now with one click on the icon , you should receive the following result :
of course , that &apos;s not the color . you have to enter two new attributes . in the colour list you have to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this , but the chess card color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object characteristics :
this step should be easy to perform , as you should have to create the basic working steps of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the ball can just be just as easy as the bottom :
in the view of the object characteristics , you can now change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the bottom of the base ) , so that the ball would make the ball contact with the bottom . otherwise the ball would be moved into the bottom around the bottom .
of course , the game is now a strange option : how to see above , the ball surface is like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now assign a material . as the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment than colour :
select Properties search and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time , some end @-@ end properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click or press the input .

you should now have a good impression of which possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned much so much that you can easily create beautiful scenes .
ra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a three @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you are a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ces , the Ren@@ der@@ ers are hypothe@@ tical pen@@ sions from the perspective of the viewer ( out of the camera which reflects the scenes ) by every pixel of the scene , which reflects the visual effects of light sources in the scene and as atmosph@@ eric effects such as the fog .
as you can imagine , you will never see the camera without having a camera . without a light source it is simply black . obviously it doesn &apos;t need to see that picture is simple black . obviously every scene you need to make some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files are usually the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously purchased with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er .
whenever you open a new model , or create the file into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the scene has been changed in the last saved version . all changes have been reserved for the last storage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this menu item can only be selected if you don &apos;t have the stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ating the last revers@@ ed command . this menu input you can only choose if you have editing editing .
store the current window and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; , here you can change the look below , the keyboard short@@ cuts and the standard behavior .
it opens a dialog for change of keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify the commands of the keyboard short@@ cut for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; -@@ instructions or new .
it opens a dialog for setting up the implementation of the tool . you can add this option to add symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; instructions and remove them .
one B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to create a rough surface without any bend on the surface individually and without the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file as well as for a b@@ ump version as well as for a text field .
base body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from several dozen or even hundreds of units . these models are then edited to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture analysis is a possibility to give the surface of a object on the pixel base , using a image file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image gallery and browser . the application has a file browser , which you can select from the image .
pictures can be displayed either in a own window in the image of the picture or in full screen mode .
use &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists , which can show you with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n .
you can set up whether every image is shown in a own window , or if all images are always to use the same windows .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right bottom corner .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and processing and slideshow , you can set the work of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show . in the two other , short command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts for the browser .

&amp; berth ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . if you want to monitor the default input of the script . of course , the script can also respond to events . naturally , this script can also ignore the events even if there is no use of it .
when a script is started , the device must be assigned to each script itself . if a script is started , fa@@ ok the working folders to the folder where all data should be saved .
note that a new piece is played . the script could now see &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features additional information about the new piece ( e.g. the met@@ adata or the section length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ ton sign@@ aling a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
welcome to custom@@ ise menu item to the selected files of the play@@ list when a user @-@ defined menu entry will be sent to the menu . to add one entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p tray info ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; finished , or when the user gets a script , sends a script to the script . this signal should be processed to operate , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script @-@ administration can also install script @-@ packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically the normal T@@ ar archive ( .@@ tar ) , which is also optionally available with b@@ anners .
&amp; width ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extensive collection . out of this , you should choose your script packages just right .
the main sk@@ ript must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) which should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link the link to the Wiki scripts page of &amp; amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ youtube , you should use the category berth ok ; script .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;

&quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &amp; berth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is only a le@@ aking play@@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the music pieces come into it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is simply . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window will be converted into the statistics window .

no . Yes , this is true ! no ! &amp; berth ok ; it has to be the actual question of what media types supported g@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / X@@ ine / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? how to see , we are so quite a very interesting audio format .
it may be ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat linux , whereby the default setting will not be supplied to MP3 de@@ coder ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ en , input

&quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the al@@ sa cat@@ ches , it must be able to use a mixer for several applications , which can be used for several applications , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools for al@@ sa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . check the help of the mix for al@@ sa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of this command should help you in search for the problem rendering and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.@@ g . high ) .
do not forget that media first need to be de@@ coded . if you don &apos;t send a MP3 to al@@ sa , you would only be a white noise . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also supports data at first . G@@ Stream@@ er can provide directly to al@@ sa , exactly like X@@ ine .
using the G@@ Stream@@ er Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable the sound server using the highest possible priority ( real time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ works SU@@ ID is set :
when K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , you can read this bug report . read this error report . the magni@@ fying the sound file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or X@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia fully to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the arts drivers . use a different driver ( the X@@ ine driver was highly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller of the buffer , the less paint react to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . Yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
Stream@@ er is installed , but when I need to change the Stream@@ er Driver , it &amp; amar@@ ok ; from why ?
after installation of G@@ Stream@@ er you need to register all components . if you register to register all G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the Stream@@ er FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can ask also the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit the Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg files , once again as your regular user . then check the module Folder from G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with a set @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it register .

will be compressed in a second step of these WAV files ( usually a Pro title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled an pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , it is now to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ up to ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers are already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , it is unlikely to be used for any Linux distri@@ butions .
which code / file format is to be used ? the chapters world Ko@@ di@@ ers have a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ ver , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copy protection .
while the setup can only be done once again ( the inser@@ tion dialog can then be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; to the hard disk . this leads to the understanding of the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface that you may never change in the beginning .
can be converted into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ver programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the Internet get or can fully work without network , whereby all manual is recorded .
this is only a short list of commands of the main f@@ encing . on the page step by step , there are more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the server to configure the program .
starts the C@@ DD@@ B enquiry of the CD specifications according to the implementation of enquiry in the register card C@@ DD@@ B . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection first must be made up to the Internet . )
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the register card , the encoding settings in the setup is configured - the code .
open a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default setting . it is to note that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the configuration dialog .
open the file manager so that a whole file is selected , instead of a full &amp; CD ; sent and consoli@@ date .
it opens the device dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for creating events ( as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
it opens the main type of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with various cards of cards ( such as enco@@ der , for inser@@ ting the enco@@ ders ) . hi@@ bit you &apos;ll have to be successfully used before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes the sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right encoding .
if any audio information should be lost , a loss free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can be recovered .
under the Audio Format@@ s , MP3 and O@@ GG are most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality with low bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but more than this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both Ko@@ di@@ ver are very good audio quality .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper , deeper in deep bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is part of a calcul@@ ator or host based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play equipment is present .
MP3 - if music also belongs to other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo equipment .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should be acceptable for most people and most of most music pieces have acceptable transparency , and has already high quality . well enough for hi @-@ stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a slightly less complex parts of the piece . well enough for hi @-@ stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . don &apos;t need 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of an Tit@@ els . well enough for hi @-@ stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11th 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of an Tit@@ els . well Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ graph@@ e@@ o@@ systems . but not well enough for hi @-@ hi @-@ stereo devices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is most commonly used for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely don &apos;t want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information provided by the free@@ DB is automatically deleted by the free@@ DB on the Internet , are available as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator : and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with the encoding programmes , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to explain the code for these programs .
for example to add the CD &apos;s title to the tables ( english : day ) to add MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t should be added to l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks so from : &apos; ... t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameter that can be used ( = button description in the assistance ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CD , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of the computer . it is to note that here only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc . , not of the audio file itself .
Yes , it should be legal , but I have not agree that it is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you from the &amp; CD ; and also the information can be added to the CD ; more or less value , so can not be added to the music by the CD ; more or less value , so can neither be the artist nor the CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ oso .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; in this type of configuration , the e @-@ mail address is not used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used for retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from server ( This is not only the programm@@ ability to know which code has been checked out . )
if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is set in many countries of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator is used to use the free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally used to use the free@@ DB is to be used for using free@@ DB . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machine .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of Spiegel@@ ungen for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the update of the database .
which reader program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know exactly in the source code .... This was always the best choice for the read of audio CD ; it has to be aware that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the right distribution if this is not happen .
to store the shared WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ers can be selected using the code@@ c ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ FP ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the register card . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the register card .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used . further information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are required in the chapters of Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installation of a code , additional information about its switch can be obtained via the input as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this may have a lot of causes . check the setup of the device diagram of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reader the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ CC , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) . try to invo@@ ke both programs using a command line in a terminal .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this will give tips how to go .
have you read the complete manual , but somehow it is still unknown to do ? Yes , no problem , follow this step @-@ step example , and you will need enough information to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps , average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sets ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . however , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files that you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have access to copy ( eg ; by trying to copy a bit into a copy ) .
the first section covers the basic input of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , something that is probably done once and
the second section describes the approach to the reading of a &amp; CD ; which must be repeated for each passing &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the use of using co@@ graphy for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 bis 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined to use the files and the structure is used to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings , we will probably not be able to change them very likely to read one &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device problem is transferred to the tool@@ kit using the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device @-@ model of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed via the device with other programs , so helps you get a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and a try using the existing entries for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here are not much too do . here , there can be a additional conversion . in our example , everything will be shown in our example , in our example , will be shown as in the screens@@ hot .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
the card reader CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow you to download the CD ; data automatically by the Internet of a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer needs to be connected during the release of &amp; CD ; with the internet to access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is simple , it is easier to read / read / edit the CD ; this is a minimum risk when you change later with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags allow you to change it . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or .
apart from that example , if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used , if you want to download the database before it is worth@@ while to use the free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two sel@@ ector is selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cart@@ on map .
C@@ DD@@ B is the free@@ DB . this is the settings for the data request , for the retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . if you want to get the CD , please read the file using free@@ DB . if you want to set it in the screens@@ hot of the free@@ DB .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
C@@ DD@@ B Server : please go to the site &apos;s fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and watch them after a mirror server . on this way , the load is distributed between the machine . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
in this example , we want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data on the free@@ DB server . the first deposit box should be sufficient .
simply enter the settings from screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp can be set on your computer )
at the same time , there is a reason why there is a reason why to read more than one at the same time when an existing drive ? parallel to read and code ? the author does not seem to try himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after reading of the last piece : cruci@@ fy this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
user defined folder for temporary files : if you created this ank@@ ind , then the file must be specified in which the WAV files will be specified in which the WAV files will not be defined , the files in the private folders will not forget to make this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything as it is on the screens@@ hot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances it is necessary to see anything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defined the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi audio systems . it &apos;s a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the result &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ ction of the creation of tags on version .0.@@ 0 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output rate ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of enco@@ ded WAV files : at a Dual@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to consoli@@ date more than a WAV file at the same time .
that is , we have just selected the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator . the configuration is selected as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never have to change them again .
in this section , the folder structure will be set , as described in the process . we will be set up to MP3 files . the folder structure , the type such as the music on the hard disk was described in the preceding paragraph . the process of the free@@ DB has been described in the preceding paragraph .
since we are a &amp; CD ; it is not included in the free@@ DB , the screen photos is a bit different than that for one &amp; CD ; so you will learn to give you the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead , to pick them from the Internet . comments will refer to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is a &apos; special &apos; issue of this manual .
if this doesn &apos;t happen , it must now be the CD ; into the drive which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and length can be listed in the window , such as the screens@@ hot . this only when the CD player could be identified as audio CD ; this could be identified and from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this doesn &apos;t happen , you are looking for questions and answers according to the help or go back to previous section regarding the basic settings .
note : if the free@@ DB has already been sent by the free@@ DB , all titles are already filled out and also the name of the artist &apos;s name and the album will be displayed .
for the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window that you can select from your mind after the best to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have the tick field for automatic query by free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also set manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need to get the connection to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will find these under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Privacy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the input for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the screens@@ hot of the &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist doesn &apos;t need any more in the input field &apos; update Title , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program . register Login Format : 1 × 50 ′
note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the free@@ DB is not empty but it contains the data like in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have an unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and this option will be set up on the tab settings ; throw up a look into the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the purchased files on any time with the day Editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it , you can also select ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all the encoding and file formats . see the help of Ko@@ di@@ ers to receive more information .
simply select one entry , the obvious with the style of the band CD ; on this example , this is not important because we are the &amp; CD ; you do not have any additional information on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or road to the example are here below Rock .
after selecting &quot; OK &quot; go back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edi@@ tors , again and you will see that the fields marked for the album already recorded with the collected data . simply enter the entries for the actual part of the text in any case and other information you wish .
click the next line in the main window and apply the same way to all the title page of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window appears not , if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it has already been sorted into one of these categories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the third &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that there is a check @-@ characters before any line of each line . a simple click on the line switches to choose from a bit or click on the bottom of the screen , select all the pieces on the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces .
this window is started by clicking on the button selection , thus the window appears to confirmation . then click OK , and then we will take a look at the windows with orders and keep what &apos;s done .
click on the rider to turn on the order window . it is located in the upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read on the hard disk . the status of the program will appear in the left part of the bar in the status bar .
this error message will see if you &apos;re trying to work with a code that you don &apos;t have installed . pieces who are not successfully tested with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have given . have checked whether you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is clear that the errors can be attached directly after the end of the piece of the piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the code of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . so please note and notice the status code in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have configuration settings to read this behavior . the only thing that configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . with a AM@@ D@@ 64 , the result is un@@ clear . the system used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 is no problem at simultaneous output and code ( e.g. two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queu@@ e is given . after the last piece is released , a small window with a message for a short time at the upper left part of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ 20 or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator : is today within the &amp; k@@ de ; C@@ VS is an part of the k@@ de@@ centr@@ alised package . if you are using C@@ VS , you can only include an anonymous copy of your distribution . if you read this , you have already done the package k@@ de@@ com from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons who use the source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of its distribution .
if you are looking for assistance such as the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program which calls for many different programs and has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example to learn the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if only the help menu of the program will be selected , without any interference on how it is going to go from this somehow empty screen ( above all , when at the time of the program jump there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from a unusual short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t do this manual . it &apos;s a first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and if you read this , it has to do this section with the author and is therefore to agree with this proposal .
so if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N you need not , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid : is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ er@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides other with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ ao@@ ke real @-@ time techniques of lyrics , some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds up to all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; also support the Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which supports G@@ US cards . al@@ sa will be included as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid : shows the Li@@ ed@@ text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI device with internal buttons on the virtual keyboard keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to mid mid format .
support the two existing standards in order to store text in MIDI files ( Song@@ text or text events ) .
session support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the playback of a Lie@@ uten@@ ant starts the mid time will start again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for latter need the L@@ up -@@ TRE@@ IB@@ ER and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can go to ... from the menu file , it appears to select a common file dialog with which help you select the song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window . this works also works with several songs .
to play a music piece , open it and press the button to play the button in the tool bar , select the entry out of the menu item or press the empty box .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will start automatically , as soon as you will be added to the &amp; k@@ mid : -@@ window . ( at several stages they will be added to a collection and then put together another one . )
once &amp; k@@ mid : one piece is playing , you can jump to any place by using the middle button and continue with the regulator .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can change the arrows left and turn right the Tem@@ po@@ ad . then click the original pace , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the empty box has two tasks : when one piece is played , a pressure on the controls , like a pressure on the button rest , or select the menu template in the menu item , then add the playback . press the empty box while no piece is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text events , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ is and again different both . some pieces have no lyrics : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid : you can adjust which events will be displayed , and even better : the repository type is selected , so that you don &apos;t have to be used , so that you don &apos;t want to be manually manually , and you have the possibility to change this , if you want to see the other way .
if you want to upload an event sty@@ p , select the text settings to create text events and song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which can be played together . this section is part of how you can use collections of collections .
to make a collection , open first collection of collection . please click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then enter the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs as well as the original songs .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the thread in collecting manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection .
if you use this collection , this collection will not be saved . if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to add a song . then you can add a song with the button to add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog where you can select the song .
add a second method to add a song , depends on the setting , automatic execution of the collection .
if automatic changes to the collection is activated , a piece will be added to the active collection automatically added to the active collection .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection , it will be activated when opening a piece of the temporary collection and gel@@ e@@ ert . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection of collection , the collection and the desired song and then click the menu .
you can select the order in which the songs are played in which the songs are played out of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or acci@@ dental order in the menu , the order will be re@@ fixed .
to play a song , select it in collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump a song next , select the button next song , the next song from the menu or press the arrow key .
to jump a song back to the reverse one song , select the Button Set , the entry forecast of the menu or press the arrow arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button button .
the temporary collection may not be deleted . however , however , however , no role as they will not be saved from &amp; k@@ mid .
this is necessarily essential for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General MIDI files . in this case the MIDI device works in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI interface that allows all events of the type Change files to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus has a trumpet sound when originally a piano play .
if you have only one sound card , do not need MIDI interface because all sound@@ cards is GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI files . you have to edit the appropriate file of your favorite ( with your favorite di@@ tor ) .
a MIDI interface is a text file that supports all the needed requests for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which can often appear as desired . a prerequis@@ ite is that each appearance is a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to show that a section starts ( except for options ) and request that the end of a crash is reached .
please send me your Map @-@ file as e @-@ mail to do I in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI .
this section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use can see as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM command will be ignored ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to insert all the sounds that you need to play this instrument with the number M . if your keyboard support is not supported ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a ri@@ fle .
if a MIDI file is played with patch 127 , it is patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant to be another per@@ missible instrument ( drums , pel@@ vic , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one , when the tone is the pitch of the same drum ( like it some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section will be used to give as the sounds on a certain channel or instrument . use is :
as at the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP Section is the order of lines very important , as well as the pre @-@ hand . you must also create 128 entries .
you can define for each channel and each instrument panel . you just need to use different names only in the first line .
keys will be used above all , to create sounds on the per@@ k@@ ite canal . check out as example the included Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form a number of channels . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , you will make it easy in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP Calendar .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion capabilities on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section , 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , set up following the pattern :
if you use the keywords name , which is defined on the channel N . if you use the keywords name for this channel , the respective key@@ note should be defined in the file : if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored that the patch shall try to change the patch on this channel .

the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates the value of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events in which ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events sends this value to the value of this formula ( r / 40@@ 96 ) . this value 40@@ 96 is returned to the Map ( R / 40@@ 96 ) .
this setting is used because GM has a keyboard , which receives a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event . unfortunately , but some key@@ boards to play a sound . unfortunately , there are some key@@ boards to play two tables to a oc@@ ta@@ ve . in order to try to try the right value to your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI interface , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this menu will find the menu settings , point MIDI settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you see what sounds just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list for each channel . if you have a instrument , the button won &apos;t be green but red to show that no more the original instrument is used .
view the channel view ( up to now ) two different views to show the sounds sounds . view the menu settings below the menu channel : settings : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a sun . if you find such a song is too fast to follow the text , you may slow it . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc .
good , I can force anyone to do &amp; k@@ mid : but a typical MIDI file doesn &apos;t need about 50 KB , while a MIDI file doesn &apos;t need to change the individual instruments , speed , speed and etc . you have the control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( counter , De@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid : that happens because &amp; k@@ mid : without A@@ WE support , you need to install a source distribution and install ( e.g. k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection but I have no desire to add all files separately .
agree , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add to &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and select all the files you want , and drag them on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
activate Javascript and activate Javascript adding . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD press to playback the standard layer you can click on the LCD double click .
I have put on a &amp; k@@ de ; working surface a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid : on this way I have to play if the collection is played to the end or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window , and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid :
if you want to add a file you want to add a file without you to add it to a collection , turn the complete documentation to the collection and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
if we take the MIDI files in mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . just want to play the first file . thus , you just want to add the first file to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then connect to B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or Post@@ cards . all heart@@ felt thanks ! if I hear these songs or the postcard , animated me to program , continue to &amp; k@@ mid :
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in Ma@@ sia ; lag@@ a ( Spain ) , I am in the third year , so I am not able to take a lot of time for my hobbies , but I try to take a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies , I collect program , MIDI files , music and phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you want to make a question or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid : if you want to make a mistake , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me a huge challenge , if you want to send me a postcard from your local group or MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ ao@@ ke file from one local group . if you want to send a MIDI file , I will send you a MIDI file , because I have already familiar with me .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid : fully written in my time and written by anyone else . I would like to empha@@ size that I would like to be aware that I would only be aware that I would like to purchase messages from users ( Post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - tension of the lack that the pitch at A@@ WE cards was high .
so click Yes , then enter a name for your project . if your company is not yet listed , you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93;
and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians in the network that offer us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid will also be found on its homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html is located on the homepage you can find information on pages with further kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is much of your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an A@@ WE card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ UAL comp@@ ili@@ eren . if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .

the use window is made of so @-@ called cra@@ ck@@ able windows . there are always the window with the play@@ list . there are the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is a information window that will only appear if information is restored .
it is possible to do the prefer@@ ential connections under the menu bar , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the &quot; Dau@@ erh@@ ouse play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain a extra hierarch@@ ies , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , Television and Dau@@ erh@@ ouse Play@@ list may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . you can only use the various files in the directory file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Mail / k@@ m@@ player , but also by using the application itself .
depending on changing the XML files , it must be selected from the menus and select either the same slider , or select one other category .
all changes are lost when processing mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
because of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation while starting and checking can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing from &#91; general Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ verse option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option does not exist , it can easily be added .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the animation of Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it will be automatically moved by opening another source . this would be the end of the end @-@ animation while the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the ad of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit : / / / home / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos / K@@ oos .

so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages you need to return the k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type Windows / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave module in the setup description of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or k@@ m@@ player can be used in a console application and to use error messages after loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the Back@@ end output is made within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console in the context menu ) .
that is always a problem rendering for a certain M@@ ime @-@ type ( of course ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , there should be phon@@ on all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be configured either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) can be configured either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . to be used , the scanner can be used to use the configuration file or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the m@@ cryp@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port . there should be used ( e.g. if it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a dv@@ b .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video , it should also work ( probably the only one that works ) . this reason is the video@@ for@@ warding extension for the X server . this is also possible to be installed on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is also included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) will be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally by K@@ M@@ Player for sources are used to use different names . at the time of this documentation this documentation is dv@@ d@@ source source , dv@@ d@@ source , source code , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , source code , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ yers . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list .
is it possible to make my CD@@ ROM drive , when I play with it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
Yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root for the use of the device . however , sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must be checked my CPU to their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ crowded . k@@ x@@ ine player needs the last value , only the first time will check X@@ ine the CPU .
to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to add image slider .

\ \ begin { fir@@ h } : this command is closed for the curves : until he is closed with \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another setting . a single word can be displayed in a set with \ \ \ \ { { } } .
\ &#93; : creates a quote in document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
as soon as the assistance has been given a bit text , there should be a few adjustments required for the complete read@@ ability of the document . it should be a quote to see a few places in the grease and curves to the application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document was viewed , the editor can be closed by editor @-@ view or Ctrl + Ctrl + it to the editor . in an external viewer , the window must be closed .

the name and Email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves to clear identification .
a member can have multiple roles in project , such as both team@@ work as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can search himself from the list of the team member , who is looking for . this is done by sending the te@@ amm@@ it@@ gli@@ ed out of the list and the button of S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will be bold after you are : text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; top names and setting of own identity are important regarding news and comments . see Information for Information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the overview of their team , there is a further advantage by collecting the members of the team : it can be an event for information on the team &apos;s team , if something takes place . see above for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something will be in the project . an example would be that later , if a file is secured , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to C@@ VS once it will be added to the C@@ VS once it will be added to the project .
on the event identification of the shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings Dialog can be created , edited and deleted .

currently , it is only a plugin that supports support for the use of &amp; gu@@ ignon ; vs J@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of Deb@@ u@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug in the project settings . with the options in addition to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if for a project a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled , some additional items in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
one view , in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . is usually in the left .
one view , in which all holding connections are listed , with line numbers and conditions are listed , usually in the lower jaw .
a view of which the output ( such as HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower jaw .
depending on the supported functions of the Deb@@ u@@ gger is everything or part of the following functionality .
with this promotion , the connection to de@@ u@@ gger , if required , or she tells the plugin based on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ese requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , that a de@@ u@@ gger is not to be observed .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus on your needs and help you to get better .
document type Edi@@ ted packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow you to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . they allow you to create and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script folder and the pictures . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the day folder and the tool .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be used ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see below for details .
this document describes how to create XML files then select &amp; descrip@@ tive r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the contents of the property site , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even the tool feature allows a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a writing .
day @-@ folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the description and descrip@@ tive language . and the daily XML files will bear the name of the recording language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ host )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and clear@@ ed if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use many users a better overview and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in the individual . everything about the possibilities and limits is placed in simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can only contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
the name of the basic class for this class is valid only . the name of the basic class for this class is valid . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of type . there is the name of the class where this method is part of this method . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Tag . this is an element type element .
this element can be set only once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of the Attributes . additionally , it will be written for each attribute . in addition it contains other tags which describe as this attributes is shown , etc . This is a just element type element .
set the source texts for the names in the Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and the attribute tree in the attribute
the d@@ co@@ p interface can be used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the source of data can be used to determine how the source of data can be used in the context of the data source .
requires source of source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting of cutting and a table names . the arguments that be delivered to the method can be empty or % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day the elements of a list is group@@ ed into one list . it can only be used for a attribute description . it is an only element type element .

there is a list of elements that can finish a day . this element is a just @-@ element type .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been looking at some of the sites that I have done with you and I am very happy with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; page to be sent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is one of the most important elements of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files in the Tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the window to start and tested Tag@@ X@@ M@@ gr . another dialog will appear to follow his simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present , check the check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following example , an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame will be used for this Tag@@ XML file .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . this file is described in this file . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ loaded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have to set up a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output option = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class _ name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; / &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = = right 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for every higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ converter . ( - / / W@@ 3C ) . ( HTML 4.01 ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click the New promotion at the same dialogue :
this can be assigned to the keyboard short@@ cuts . by clicking the button the button can be selected ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cuts .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ai@@ li@@ ated settings and in execution of the action , this text is added to the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful shar@@ eholder . with the help of these action may change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not restricted ) to change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
although qualified qu@@ ade is recommended , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir &apos; command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DAY / share / free / qu@@ anta / free local scripts : $ P@@ ATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document , in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance , the text is running into the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script is used .
the parameter for this event is usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods the script can be adjusted from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus on the default input . in the selection field input can be determined to send to the standard input .
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % variable is usually only with this setting .
in accordance with the input , the output can be led to the output of the application . there are two types of issue : normal output , on the default output . it can be specified with the default output . it can be specified with the default output output .
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar to create a tool bar with the name of the brand .
as soon as a tool bar has been added , you need to add actions and configure settings .
the parts of this thread are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New promotion at the bottom end of the window in the bottom end of the window .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the right tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and if the tag attributes and you are planning to plan the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day edit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when available , so it is possible to insert a input under the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ am ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should notice the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action will better be better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit . choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select one another .
please note that the symbol is not only helps you realize what the promotion does , but also in all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in regards to that the day is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually less than los , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least be able to add a message to the user .
after creation of symbol tools , it must be connected to the promotion . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field , a button will press him .
select the folder where the stored symbol is available , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button button and set it with other tags , so it &apos;s still available , or confirm with the OK button .
in addition , you want to complement some exercises and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool form or should be set for better overview through some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool spot on the settings dialog . make sure that the desired work@@ piece is selected .
I would like to select the Tren@@ ner ( left top right ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool . this adds the item to the tool .
you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc .
please note how the Tren@@ ner is not able to support the group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my work@@ piece might be believe that &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; the contrary the start of the start @-@ button .
the new tool bar must be tested by proxy to all symbols to ensure that everything works .
in the right folder after the e@@ XML is not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool bar should be loaded in the right folder . please do so that their work@@ piece is loaded ( n ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the mentioned extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for script language or the form@@ atting language you may like . therefore , this chapter describes how I have a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could start at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus and rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting and script / etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation of documentation . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; please note that you can easily change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; www / gallery / &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
note the # before getting started and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with your content . there is no known border for the chess stream depth ( except with reason ) m@@ d@@ ash : but try it yourself .
you realize that the contents can be found directly to a file system ( and consequently it is indicated on the upper end of the construction man@@ sion &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder ) .
empty spaces are nothing but notice on &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ ams are replaced .
the text section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , the context of the context of context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script , the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ f@@ etch _ array function returns the documentation directly . there is only two types of entries here : the context of the context ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file extensions .
a simple list of separate separate properties elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , this are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and set in $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / eMail / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / category / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / share / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder on how to use this in your file do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. for the documentation you have been used to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development process .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , factory settings with actions , scripts , templates ) with others .
the resources can send e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent . to different places there is a menu item entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be downloaded here . the contributions will be checked and only available when our team will be checked as correct and usable for the publication . to ensure that the resources are assured , the origin of the resources are ensured both for our team as well as for later users .
when you upload your Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple key words you have to look out . in the dialog box , the input fields must be empty ( URL preview ) and click on the bottom of the upload .
the upload can be uploaded from the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) . download the menus and folders in the templates and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates .
after downloading a resource , even before installing the installation and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource is given and it may be broken down . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message with the author of the text is displayed .
it is possible to work on XML languages , currently not from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . it is possible to work with an D@@ TE@@ P package , because hundreds of day files can be needed in day XML format . there are the simpl@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD into an D@@ TE@@ P package .
this conversion can be created from the D@@ TD format and conver@@ sions of a D@@ TD , select the .@@ dt@@ d file containing the D@@ TD details which shall be used . then the following dialog will appear in the following dialog :
target : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / E / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p Folder .
you will have to type in your host@@ name , if your site is not found , you will be asked if you want to save your project .
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this chapter has to be familiar with these fundamental concept without understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three sections : global , local and project management . this distinction is a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is available , available as a global network , which is available as a global network , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which are available in a multi @-@ user environment that are available in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of Web@@ entwick@@ lungs@@ firmen , which are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ pieces . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user .
project @-@ related elements are available within a specific project . it can be said to be a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all items are in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the construction of the board , with information and the tool bar . please suggest that in and for further information on these areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can click on the card with the right mouse button to obtain a contex@@ tual menu with the current document folders , such as complete , delete or re@@ load the document , delete or upload the document to the current document or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
Right @-@ to @-@ document ( void / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste ( paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste on the mouse button in the editor .
at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers , the tool bar can be shown at the top of the Edi@@ tors . currently , the tool is now being shown as standard for which a set of work@@ piece is shown in the course of the further excav@@ ation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider . an easy to use search interface in English ,
the construction of the project ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate through the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to navigate through the files , project , sample pattern , document structure , scripts and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that establish@@ es all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by a right mouse click . actions such as Hin@@ di , removing , upload , upload or delete files from the memory medium with the program editor .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole page &amp; etc . there are all possibilities .
templates can be shared in three categories depending on which in which they are used . the category depends on the relevant user and templates in projects can be used only in the project .
here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of the attached to Global , Lok@@ al and project works here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can open the available information about the right mouse button .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document indicates the cur@@ sor in document to the position of the element . through right click of an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and collecting the building .
this tree appears under the other building views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . it is possible to download the documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site , you can create your own documentation , and see how to add a folder on an project , it can be edited and edited .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two cards played at the bottom end of the window , through the use information can be achieved : the news window and the problem window .
this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015
this card shows all error in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as shown ) in this window .
the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus holder : tool bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and get the relevant command . the chocolate bar ends the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a work@@ piece with E@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the tool in an e @-@ mail to send them into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as any other support and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus on your system . if auto@@ conf is given a number of options that can be transferred to the control box . to get a complete list of all options , give you a complete list of all options , give you a complete list of options , which are easy to understand and click here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check whether your path to &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin file contains . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ ATH before their bin file is the same applies for &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is optimised for a quick Web development and combines an outstanding design environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is an independent , extended range of languages : what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus would be an independent , ext@@ end@@ able Web development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tools . it is summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus should be defined .
now , to the above mentioned claim , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; it is not only possible to include users and developers , but it allows users and developers , such as they need for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web development to enhance the use of intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can be possible to autom@@ ate the productivity of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and has been extended fast to an outstanding editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is available in no way with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL @-@ li@@ zen@@ ated version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL to &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta . ) .

a quick release of the files you opened . these list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry will be taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . check out the section of templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project contents , only one errors .
when inser@@ ting the cli@@ pboard there are applied special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ loss@@ ary , so that they may display properly and not supported by browser as form@@ atting argument .
convert text from the cli@@ pboard into &amp; URL ; chess , which the correct way to insert special characters and character characters in &amp; URL ; s . first line for inser@@ ate &amp; URL ; s in the An@@ ker tag .
switches the block selection of or out . that allows you to select text blocks with the aid of the &amp; shift ;
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined out to help you .
shows the news window or not an example . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
extension and turn of the problem with the problem in the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the problem of problem is activated , as soon as you change the structure of the tree .
shows the symbol sp@@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to specify read characters with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the predi@@ ctions of the predi@@ ctions , depending on the cur@@ sor in the document .
reading out of other documents in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
the selected files will be copied into the current project . the selected files will then copied into the project directory .
search the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows you to copy video files in your project folders or copy it to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depend on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have additional inputs / output terminals ( ki@@ o slave ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project was managed by the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool . these are stored in project management / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu when you have registered this project .
a dialogue to store your work@@ piece . allows you to select the type of the tool to select : local or project .
to add a dialog to add a new tool bar . it is created only the name . actions must be saved by settings . actions must be saved by settings , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool store .
a work@@ piece is removed from the visual area . if you don &apos;t have the hard disk , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to send your own tool bar to someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the menu item opens a new email message with the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is possible to access the work@@ load on the main server where each other can access the main server . see here .
upload one &amp; D@@ TD ; that you have made or possibly any one to another , and you are currently converting it into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
upload the En@@ tit@@ ches from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful when the En@@ tit@@ ches from &amp; D@@ TE@@ P is to ren@@ ew without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a writing in the global K@@ DE file is not present .
this menu includes a list of the tags which are available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool .
allows access to the current tag description dialog when there are one . this entry is currently available , followed by &amp; D@@ TD , and specific sub @-@ menu .
it is activated with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent interfaces means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is denied when this day is working on this site .
in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed below the menu entries . click on one activated slider .
sel@@ ects the syntax mode for the current file . the list of available linear schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose the type of line @-@ quot@@ ation . very useful when you know people who know other OS platforms . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the various types of the user interface . through some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switching is sometimes need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the card sheet card mode is the default value , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the description in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides a entry to each open windows . with a selection of one contract , the corresponding window will be activated .
the display of status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main f@@ rot@@ ers at respectively .
changes in this dialog needs any application that use the K@@ HTML document , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
fix the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details on details .
a dialog box appears in which you delete entries from the tool box or add which parameters can be changed .
this should not create an assistance accordingly to the environment of the mouse , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free @-@ free , but as with each open source project , developers can always use the developers . if you want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of top right after the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information can be adjusted later with shift ; F@@ 7 project Features are set to be adjusted .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name will automatically be filled out .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Project file . by default , it is the name of the project in small book@@ cases and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine where you want to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ CA@@ .de ) or a IP address ( 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if one can be empty , the default settings of the selected protocol is required depending on the remote computer could be necessary .
this is the folder that will be stored in the templates for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this is the folder where the tool is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you have static web content you need to download and change the scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you must be different .
when a project is started in the main folder of the project , should be integrated into the main folder of the project .
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can create a precise selection of good sel@@ ections .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by attachments or , by removing the glue , out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be uploaded into the menu item with the menu item in the lower window profiles or with the keyboard short@@ cut ; F@@ 7 .
some settings are described in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ ements possible ) that are reading at project @-@ related operations such as project folders are ignored .
supple@@ mentary option to above , also files containing the .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore will be excluded from the project .
project view that will be loaded during opening of the project . it can be read more about project views .
the FTP Location Manager window enables you to define a number of connections for use in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles can be adjusted as well as the display of the server for the content of the server for each profile , creating a own design concept for each profile .
in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , and a mailing list will be determined . see below details .
in the sub @-@ window event , the event may turn off and delete these actions , change or delete them . event reactions are executed when a previously defined event , such as the si@@ ege of a file . see below the details .
by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project , which was opened . this behavior can not affect it .
to open a different project , select the project to open ... from the menu project or the symbol project , open from the tool . the dialogue project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have been added to the project .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before loading when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project building contains free access to the files in the project . there can be the files in the current project .
in the context of the mouse button , the menu will be opened with the mouse button and opening the mouse button in the menu .
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is left to avoid the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and where it is necessary . this option is useful when frequent upload files necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk option is not available .
this will leave the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many re@@ charging profiles are created and thus enabling the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or create a profile , this dialogue is displayed .
this is the name of the server to be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
you can check the transfer line for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally it must not be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your spru@@ e boxes , this is either a time saving feature or a danger . use it to measure . the password is stored on the plate wear , so that it can be easily be read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in the pl@@ art@@ ext .
a project view is only a set of files and work@@ piece . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. through simple exchange of the view , and replace the currently open files and tool keys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be stored easily and deleted by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu tool bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps to increase productivity , but simpli@@ fies adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool bar can be used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best about the tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use and Add images in the section below are handled at the bottom of the tool below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool bar and the symbols can be set either by means of contex@@ tual menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the dialog box can be selected , can be used as a tool bar or tool bar , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions can be displayed on this or other tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a call for action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries may be removed and action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool bar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool keys ... and Settings actions can be set .
assi@@ sts in the essential documentation system , code sc@@ opes and files into the relevant documentation system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move seam@@ lessly or any of the existing directory included in the template tree . templates are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations that you set themselves for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions on the start of every template listed in the beginning of the usage .
Bin@@ ary is everything that does not pur@@ se text . it can be added any text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . Bin@@ ary templates are usually added in documents using jQuery ( e.g. images ) .
documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates , you will be created new documents . normally , a simple application for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate manner to be efficient . some examples can be found in the previous tree under global templates . see below for more information about the templates .
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text area will always be added to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information about the templates .
as the name says , these templates are organized for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents which are organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized into a compressed archive archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ) , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select a template that save text as a local template .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back . leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published . required fields are marked *
choose text in your document and click the text as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be selected with zi@@ pper and attach them to the builders .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can be accessed only in a template folder . it can be used only in a template folder . it can be used to create all file management functions , so it can be used and inser@@ ting or paste using the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select a folder in the file tree or in the project files , select a folder on the right and secure , by default , but of course it can be saved as local or global player .
project templates allow you to create a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ steps . in addition , you can create head@@ lines or paste with them . in addition , you can create some things on using templates in projects very deep deep in the eye .
the template structure in the lower window advertising is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / review / qu@@ anta / commodities / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores / stores /
in order to specify the behavior of a folder , in the template with the right mouse button to click the folder and choose in the context menu of the file .
a selection field with three previously defined types ; files , text or templates . this selection is recommended as soon as el@@ ter@@ ated attributes .
this is enabled by default and fits all besides the basic folders in the previous folder . if a common folder would be set , the bla@@ h would be enabled in this path . if nothing is displayed in this path , the bla@@ h would appear in the case of a normal folder . if nothing happens , you probably will probably be in a tribe folder .
permits issued or displayed text for templates in this folder . this could be the general head@@ lines or foot@@ steps for all templates for a particular project and allows the copy of a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ steps .
in addition you have access to a full command menu ( to indicate the mouse button ) via a complete command section for adding folders or copy and insert videos from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL . Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor operates as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML , -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you edit and edit the source code editor which are visible in the source code in the source code .
while working with the V@@ PL , editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol that is necessary to edit the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ens@@ a from &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL . it is not possible to edit the source text editor . there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode is just like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL , editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in V@@ PL ; Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron runs on this mode , the button allows the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , with the position in the document .
synchron@@ isation spac@@ ing between the V@@ PL , Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings to select from V@@ PL ; -@@ View , you can automatically choose between synchron@@ isation by one click or automatically .
it is assumed that you want to change the title of the website so is to choose document folders when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called as soon as a new document containing the V@@ PL . it is also used as a new document containing the V@@ PL . it is used to change the suspension of the suspension .
meta tags included the storage of information about the document , e.g. for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons , e.g. key words on the column names and keywords keyword key to the contents column .
this forum is moder@@ ated beforehand : your contribution will only appear after being vali@@ dated by a site administrator .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is such as in a text processing by moving with the cup , possible . the marking works such as usual . text can be added as usual . text can be added as usual . text can be added as usual . text can be added as usual . text can be added through inser@@ ting or removal .
the inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool bar , such as in source text editor , it is necessary to note that the inser@@ ting tags didn &apos;t remove the same identical tags , e.g. if a anchor day is removed with text , each other can be removed with text .
some of the tool like the tables Assistent or the lists of mailing lists are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; later in this release , the tables or lists can be used .

it was very complicated because there had been a lot of changes at the same time , and at the same time , another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text . the result were numerous conflicts within meeting .
those of me used programs showed me only the changed lines , but could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on positions where the changes had been changed .
this was the start of the start . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the differences within a line and changes made of white characters . later , each amount of useful functions are added .
if you would like to compare this text , simply copy it into the cli@@ pboard and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the Compare and merge of Ord@@ inations . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
this is useful when two persons are fully supported . this is useful when two persons are independent from one piece of code and displays the original file ( the basis ) helps to edit conflicts . in this editor , you can also edit the result . the screens@@ hot shows three qu@@ ell files using the merge :
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and related to the possibilities of present color monitors . if you are often co@@ whi@@ de , you &apos;ll may like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible below . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this on a view of the column in the column on the left side . ( no trouble , if it doesn &apos;t change the inser@@ tion ) .
if a file is equal , and the other is different in a line then shows the color to which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders you can find out the file name of the first file . example :
if you have any qu@@ eries , please contact us if you are not logged in as a club member .
the opening dialog allows you to specify the file name from the set list , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select one of the last name from the set list . if you have to specify the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
if you select a folder , you can select a folder if you want to set a folder . if you select a folder , the password will be selected , for B and C but a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two other folders .
if the function is enabled , the input field is active and can edit the input field . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output rate .
the input button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before you start using the password / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only part of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ pboard into the active comparison window .
you can also use copy and write a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file , e.g. several other features . if you want to figure out what these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would like to copy , paste , paste , paste , and then compare .
note : currently , you can leave nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not only the input of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors will interpre@@ t the numer@@ als and paste text in another program as exp@@ orting and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such case you could go to your original data .
in the upper part of each text line , the information line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) Je@@ de Info line has a different color .
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a colour blue , B , colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can be seen at the color which file differs from red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) .
on the left side of the text , the column displays the corresponding colour . when differences in white characters , the color is not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters only exist in character and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases ) .
vertical line that runs the merger column is interrupted by the places where the source file doesn &apos;t set any lines . if the line of line is completed , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the search interface ( among the comparative window ) also has a info line with the wording : , the file name and the file &#93; if you have installed the result . usually contains it through the automatic merge , but often contains conflicts .
! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be resolved ! ! ! ( use the buttons of Spr@@ inge to the most commonly used conflict about the remaining conflicts . )
when only two seconds can be used , every difference in the same applies to a conflict of manually .
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows and the first line of the group will be shown in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed .
sometimes the text of the text &amp; lt ; no other line is left to the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you might change your opinion , and perhaps another source code . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a mark that you might copy and paste otherwise .
the text &amp; lt ; merge @-@ end ; looks like if you copy such text from the search window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you choose from the sources the options can ignore the options available or rotate C / C + + comments , are changes in numbers or comment@@ aries , like white signs are treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates primarily with the image of the mouse and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to turn right , the right , the end , Ctrl @-@ start and Ctrl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . the over@@ drive column can also be used by clicking on the navigation bar .
using the inser@@ tion switch , you can also use the other buttons to editing . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inserts and transfer mode . ( default mode is the default mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ized columns to synchron@@ ize the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section ) and the edi@@ int output file was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation by using the current / first / last difference , to next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( Ctrl @-@ down / Str@@ ength ) , and to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict .
to copy the mark@@ up in the cli@@ pboard , you need to copy the copying -@@ button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl @-@ Insert ) . if this option is activated automatically , you may be automatically deleted automatically in the cli@@ pboard . be using this option but you may be able to write the content of cli@@ pboard acci@@ dentally .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ers are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line @-@ feed signal \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ r \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ r \ n \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ \
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically and when you come back to the next Start . ( Settings Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 users ... )
select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialogue with variable width to choose , you should not use this but not use )
if you activate this option , differences in short text will not be displayed . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be adjusted accordingly . on these systems , the button settings automatically displays an odd color .
if this option is activated when pressing the tab@@ oos button the appropriate number of empty characters is inserted . otherwise a tab@@ oo notes is inserted .
if you press or return , the further line will automatically be used for the next line automatically .
when this option is activated , any selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ pboard . the manual turns into the cli@@ pboard .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the general sel@@ ectable selection on the operating system .
when selecting files are trying to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical rows in the source files are ignored . the second step is not ignored . the second step is not ignored . the second step is not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wag@@ tail command &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a tick @-@ feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but you may also see files with different sizes on the page to the page . if this option is checked , wag@@ gons must be de@@ activated , but if this option is checked , this option will be de@@ activated .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , differences will appear as white signs .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comment@@ aries are treated like changes in white characters .
the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files .
in the automation mode mode , this setting is indicated as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ rest conflict is maintained .
when you need to change the functions in white characters by selecting the selected file as source . it is useful when the white characters are less important . if you only need to change the functions in many files , please note that the Automatic selection also include conflicts in numbers or comment@@ aries , when the options are missing or ignored C / C + + -@@ comments are activated .

if a file is stored and already an older version , the original version is attached , the original version is attached to the original version . if already , such a backup file is deleted with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version , it will be deleted without additional security .
the interface of this option does not include the currently ongoing program . you have to restart the currently ongoing program . you have to restart and restart the change . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available since the language is compatible with global control centre ) .
the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you use this option , the upper adjusting will be used for all entries .
a short note for the code appears a short note to which the local code is not changed . ( this may not be changed , it has not changed for a purely inform@@ al character . )
fit the source code for source files . this does affect such as special characters and interpre@@ ts . because the code for each file can be individually adjustable , even files with different encoding are compared and assembled .
if you have a file , you can specify which code should be used for saving .
if you define the input commands , you may not work with your code c . ( e.g. , your files 16 bit Uni@@ code ) , but the pre@@ processing command can only set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII character . ) With this option you can specify the code of the issue of pre @-@ processing commands .
( note : this applies to changes in white characters in the text or text box . ( note : this applies to changes in figures or comment@@ aries if the options can ignore or ignored C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode the differences between two of three files are shown . but sometimes you would like to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . you simply simply use the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
order the comparison window side by side or transfer each other . this can also be useful for the ads of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and decide how to configure the files . a simple click starts and use the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the initi@@ ator , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be transmitted to the external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own experience , which corresponds to your needs . you can use this function for you to cut off parts or to correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is given to the external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command input is used ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be using the command line .
the idea behind this is to enable users more flexibility when creating the di@@ ff results . but this is an external program , and most users would like to program that in most cases of cases or per@@ l completely completely .
use these pre @-@ input commands to convert this input commands to convert : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

while you experiment with sed experiments , you might understand it and perhaps may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ign@@ or@@ ating numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in the diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a relevant , and every relevant hits will be replaced by nothing , so some may be deleted .
sometimes you would like to perform several events at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the meaning of each other :
instead of sed , you can also use something different like e.g. per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;@@ s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / FTP / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ l are available in per@@ l some details . where is deleted \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l only need ( and ) without the pre@@ defined &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal Pre@@ processor processor will be kept for display and merge . the further operations are changing only the data which the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ off @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the card is assigned the output of normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful but such as each function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files . from this point you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders to compare and together .
... makes it possible for each object to create a proposal ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ate and shows the simulated changes without it actually be done ,
... carries selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is the Compare and assem@@ bling of individual files . you have to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be assembled , folder folder will be used as a base . if no target folder has been used , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder folder is used as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you informed about the current progress . if you see the scanning of the folder , only the files listed below are listed below .
when the scanning of the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a light window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ...
any file and each folder you found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select a object using a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed . you can select a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right .
when you click on a file , the file folder will be started , and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of type in the other folder is different , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object . in such case the merge action can not automatically be selected . if the merge will be started , you will also be informed about problems of this kind .
like in the above image , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
the same applies to identical entries is the same as the same as the age of the entries are different .
folders are considered identical if their content is identical . then you also folder the same color . then you have the same color . at folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea to this color is based on several di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf , which is green , then yellow is yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C is identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target if there exists )
... A and B is identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target if there exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target if there exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same data type ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : errors caused by conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such incorrect objects can &apos;t be started .
... A and B not the same data type ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : errors caused by conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such incorrect objects can &apos;t be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder , and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action that are identical to the folder .
... A and B exist , but not identical are : together and the result in both folders . ( the users see the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the release , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be assembled and the option of new file instead is activated , then the date of files and propos@@ es the newer file , but the date is identical to the files are identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange may not be removed .
during the meeting , a file after the other works . you have completed a status after the other . when the meeting was successfully completed , and according to others , if the meeting is completed , you should see a final review and see if the status is entered into order .
if in the folder dialog the file distribution method is selected , K@@ UL@@ 3 more columns is selected , the number of un@@ certain@@ ties , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflict will only appear if three folders are compared to or assembled . )
you can either rede@@ em the just selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries are selected ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
note : if you have no target folder , then use the three folder merge mode C as a goal , to synchron@@ ize the two and / or B as a goal .
if you selected a target folder , check whether all entries will be shown in the folder structure . there are several options by the specific entries are displayed in the folder structure .
to select all entries , select controls and select F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . select the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if applicable data types are still not yet invalid combination of actions , it appears to be a message to the faul@@ ty elements . you can choose a valid action .
when you manage all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , Sim@@ ulate and breaking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to see what would happen if you want to change without the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a manual intervention is necessary ( together with a manual intervention is necessary ( together a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , select again or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved a folder , then a corresponding dialog box will be displayed in a folder . then , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; there is a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the causes of the problem . you have the option to select a different action for the entry or the problem if you continue with the compilation .
if some entries have been individually folded , noticed that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries have not been saved . even if you have not tested this entries , these entries will not be considered . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be assembled once again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 users ... ) now has a section called directory memory with these options :
only files that fit on the indicated patterns are shown in the element tree . split the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is to correspond with this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to that pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default setting is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to that pattern , are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default setting is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally be@@ got files are set by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder has to be set up with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
in some file systems , a hidden attribute . a file is hidden . a file is hidden . a file is hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files appear in the element tree or not . this option is displayed in the default setting .
links on files : when the option is switched off , symbolic link will be compared . if the option is switched on , the files are converted to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default setting .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic link will be displayed in the file . if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal folders .
the complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ avo@@ ids , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower if it is applied to files that do not contain text .
if you compare large folders to compare a slow network , it may be faster , only the change date and the file size . this speed offers a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is automatically activated in the default setting .
similar to confi@@ denti@@ ally the change date . there will be no real comparison instead . the files are considered as the same as they are equal . this can be useful when copying the change date . please use this option in the default setting .
to synchron@@ ize the synchron@@ isation mode when two folders are specified and no target folder has been selected . in this mode the proposals will be the same as the file will be used in both folder . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , copying the copying of the newer file as an action . ( this is not considered necessary for the knowledge that the other file does not change . ) This option is off automatically .
if a file or a folder will be replaced by another file , the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the original version . this is the normal merge file with the .@@ original extension . this is also the normal context of individual files , not only the merge folder . this option is enabled in default setting .
usually the folders are visible in the context of individual files ; you can turn the window button by mouse button . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the window size and text window to switch between the two views between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file just using double click . however , the file contains a corresponding menu item . if you want to save the file , the status will be added to the merge source and the file will not be used again when you start the folder .
this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory # : read
K@@ DE support network quality with the help of ki@@ o slave slave . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read the files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open the local or remote machine .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one of an FTP server . the second command line generates a folder within a compressed archive system with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax of local files and folders . a few things should note :
the path can be relatively easy . or if it is not possible , URLs are not possible , these are always absolutely absolutely .
( # - &gt; % 23 , empty label &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the names / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system , sometimes using the protocol , there is a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or a folder will be accepted . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , controls the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note : this is only possible at local files ) .
the main purpose of the main purpose is currently being able to start the built @-@ in @-@ room viewer . K@@ OL@@ D starts at first always in the built @-@ in @-@ room viewer . in order to start the right mouse button on the differences between the differences and choose between the context menu and then select the diff@@ user interface between the context menu .
if it is needed or k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full @-@ diff@@ use , if it is applied to a random file in the Uni@@ fied format , the file contains a patch file in Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the name of the original files should exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch is to restore the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu . please note that this does not work when there is no original files . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will only supports two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or password from folders is not supported in the K@@ GB mode .

I use G@@ PL files already very long and have learned that I have learned in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this path or go to it .
in the READ@@ ME file , you will not find the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the READ@@ ME file you find more details on this topic .
if only the number of white signs are different , these lines should be used as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same . if you are not identical , the line is not identical . if you are not the same as it is not identical , the line is not identical .
the editor allows for any difference in files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to design a conflict simply by clicking on the source text and select it too much effort to design extra a file format that could save this information .
the effort has been too big . you can always recover certain amount of text by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit the larger quantities of text should be used .
after removing text is suddenly written ; No no lin@@ eup ; appeared and the text does not delete itself . what does it mean and how can it be removed ?
this makes it possible for us to make a number of different colors . even more her@@ metic would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . do not use any other editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need to be able to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new .
information about how to use K@@ UL@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
to re@@ comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ you are the folder in your system in which K@@ DE is installed . if you are un@@ certain , you will find more details in the READ@@ ME file .

only differences in all folders are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you &apos;ll need to update these options to the folder with the update update . )
it will only display entries that can be copied into the target folder . if the destination folders are not already copied into the target folder . if the target folder will not be copied into the target folder , this option is posted in a later program version . ) This option is in default setting .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the circum@@ ference A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are already attached to one of the selected group , the lines will be attached to the selected group at the end of the selected group .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . Under@@ standing in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtual system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays a mini@@ atures of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to change the current programmes on the working areas , to finish their size or to move it . this works as well as in a working area as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be selected , all the virtual system areas as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even moving on the desktop .
the middle mouse button can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area as well as other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button will be selected : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu will only be selected , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ised , maxim@@ ize work surface and reference .
maxim@@ ises the use window to the full size of the working area . only when applied to a application .
the application for the selected virtual working space will only appear when applied to a application .
this tick field marks marked , can be post@@ pon@@ ed within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also be moved to other working areas .
if this field is indicated in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the name of the virtual work surfaces are displayed .
with the names of the virtual working area , the numbers of the virtual working spaces will show the names of the virtual working spaces , the name with folder will be provided , and eg . 1 working area .
when this field is crossed , the background of each working area is also shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is loaded , the running programs are shown as small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , the empty working spaces are indicated to allow their selection .
the View window shows a small view of the program window . the symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program code . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager are known : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ Ra@@ ster show , all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal line and drop in a vertical line which is very good for the presentation at the sides of the work surface .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager device in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the window can be changed as symbols or with their contents . it also runs outside the control bar .
click on the right mouse button and then select the switch button and select the dialog settings .

&amp; k@@ ite ; it is a screen @-@ screen . you may have a part of the screen , so that you may have a part of the screen . this application is for different users of artists , web designers and people with a visual dis@@ ability . this documentation is a complete manual for use &amp; k@@ ills .
&amp; k@@ ite ; is a very powerful application that is continuously expanded to achieve new functions . it is optimized for the use of high @-@ weak encryption .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , the main window is displayed . the main window is displayed in the picture . below , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fication window . the picture which is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen .
the default setting is enlarged &amp; k@@ mag . alternatively , the area around the mouse is like a mo@@ vable L@@ upe . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( eg ; on left side screen ) .
you would like to avoid that the mouse is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse button . please note that &amp; k@@ mag is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse button and its size . this can be done on the following ways :
move the mouse into the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fying glass and move the left . this also comes with the arrow keys .
if you use the &amp; shift ; then press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the sel@@ f@@ window remains stand and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ ite ; features a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged photo directly to the printer , in a file to insert a file into the cli@@ pboard ( around it later in different applications ) , image paper and much more .
start or stops the update of the display . you causes the needed CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , means , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will appear in a window . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; it is automatically used to store your command prompt to store files , opening up a new window , printing , new@@ s@@ ads ( with the button document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and displac@@ ement &amp; etc .
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ end@@ al ; it is a screen @-@ screen . you can use the screen to enlarge it as if you use a L@@ upe to enlarge the small print on a newspaper or an photo . this application is for different people from the benefit of research : from research to the web designer or visually han@@ dic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ uli@@ ert a mouse click , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who suffer in the same place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can cause pain , while clicking on the mouse , and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can find a doctor who are using the use of your computer if you do not happen if this is not happen .
in order to increase it even once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pain helps to avoid the mouse with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the mouse , is useless .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement .
the smart move is activated , making it a break after it has been executed when pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , when the mouse button is running . the intelligent shift requires a little exercise if you make it easy to get quickly .
this ref@@ s must go to the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . click the mouse button .
if the mouse is switched on , the rotation is switched on ( 1 / 10 s ) . here is the time to adjust the mouse button ( 1 / 10 s ) .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a s@@ lick to the left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button .
when the sound is delayed , you can move the response time . open the car and multimedia , choose Sound System and Multimedia , choose Sound System and click here .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will only be available under each start from &amp; k@@ de ; and this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values which were loaded when opening of the dialog . have already set the button fastening , the settings are set on the stand after the last leg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first use it . especially the intelligent drive should be switched off . if you have to re@@ sign the automatic mouse click on the automatic mouse to take it later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ en ; if you need it .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click without the effect : the click on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that doesn &apos;t provide a link to these areas , so you can use the mouse on such places where you want to use them again .
when your mouse is filled , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come with the mouse ball in contact .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as the happens is by mouse only . it should be quickly clearly , if you look to the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rollers . these are on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , which was used in the sphere and dirt , you can easily rip them with a flat blade or the finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system starts the version of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you start a shift operation , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . thus , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be put back and you can work as usual .

the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs his time to copy it to copy it to copy it into the cli@@ pboard .
use text file instead when you start straight to begin &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . select text instead of using a mouse click , and hold the mouse button down while you move the mouse on the other end of the text and again when clicking on the mouse button .
use the mouse click on the mouse . thus , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool take a sound like a mouse click . thus , you can use it as a mouse click . later , you can use it even without the audi@@ ble mouse click .
in order to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension must be installed on &amp; X window ; this should be the case for most of the system .
the functionality of the mouse button is available only when the system features a sound card and speaker and features it correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse is short ver@@ y@@ rt . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can be configured to be configured to be configured in order to get a zip immediately before the mouse button takes place . this way can also be done using the mouse and lay down with the mouse .

with the program &amp; k@@ tag ; you are dum@@ my users to speak the computer for themselves . the users can choose from a list with the talk and phrases which should be spoken again .
on the first side of the assistance ( lin@@ ers screens@@ hot ) you will find the command to be used for the language edition of text . more details will be found in the description of the installation site .
on the second page you select the standard text files . from the text files you can choose from the text files you often have to be dealt with .
on the third page ( right screens@@ hot ) create the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ al language . &amp; gt ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ night ; it is clear and contains a input field for the key@@ boards of your sets ( the lower white field in screen screens@@ hot ) and a distortion @-@ containing phrases ( the upper @-@ white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
if you have done a tag , you can enter the sentences , you can listen to the sentences , which you want to hear . every single set will be sent to the default memory . you can choose from it that could be spoken again .
with the menu settings Text settings , set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ tag ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page supplement , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
the input field for the card reader will give the command to the command of the voice generator . in the selection field under the input field , insert the string with the text to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ ck ; knows two kinds of release the text . select the cruci@@ fix@@ ion when the text is unchanged as standard insert to the language generator .
if the text box is not selected , the text will be used as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command will take place for language issue of your language @-@ generator . this command will find you in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this topic you can find in the Anne@@ x .
as a language service , the text can be used as a language service , the text for the K@@ TT@@ SD language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications a standardis@@ ed interface for voice output and is currently being used in SV@@ N . the option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field promotion after selecting a text box you decide which action is triggered by the keyboard or by selecting a text box in the text box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tool@@ box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box is one of the fastest ways to get the entry into the box and choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the second sel@@ ector box , you can specify whether the text files are automatically stored on the processing system when closing the machining device .
by selecting text files , the book is saved . if you choose changes , the text password will not be saved .
in addition to the input field , it contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ al . in the main window , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ restri@@ al .
turn right onto the right onto the right on the side , you may edit dic@@ tion@@ books or add them into a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
for this source the desired language ; &amp; nbsp ; read the &amp; k@@ de ; read the frequency of the number of words . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can communicate the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; gt ; ask for the dic@@ tion@@ aries related to the dic@@ tion@@ aries and how these weights are to be detected .
with this option , add a new , empty dictionary without entries . since you have to add new words automatically into the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main range of the window for processing of text files is divided . in the upper part , the text files are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text box , you can select the text box or the related keyboard . if you select a text password , you can only change the name .
actions like new text messages or books may be made or selected text messages and books you can either browse the menu bar in the menu bar , in the tool bar or through a folding menu .
the order of text messages or text files can be changed by means of the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the Alt ; button .
the selected text is selected and copied into the cli@@ pboard . if the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise , if the selected area is selected .
the selected text is selected in the cli@@ pboard . if the input field is selected , this is used , otherwise , if the selected area is selected .
the currently active set is spoken . if the text is used in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected parts of the con@@ sol@@ ation stores .
this menu item is placed on the menu bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is mounted directly under the menu bar and can be moved directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left left side and pulling the tool bar to another place .

the Free@@ T@@ TS is one in &amp; Java ; flexible voice generator . currently , it only supports the English translation . the licence allows it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without limitations .
to show an example of command line parameter for the set of command line , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ ew@@ ettes . the language output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ ists in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need a additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA to MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / Cai@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , the final sign of the text , so that a additional character must be mounted . the complete command is therefore more complex than in other examples :

filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ own ; are filters not required .
in filters , text will be edited , before he is sent to the prompt reply . they are useful for improving the address , to select false words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations to deal with a specific language and voice , or in order to deal with certain aspects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; writes &quot; Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; with a text . &amp; gt ; different types of lyrics .
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ eda has the highest priority . you will read all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the given orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . one warning has priority and holds the output of news and nor@@ mal@@ in text . this orders will be continued again after the issue of the warning again .

the rest are simple text orders . each mandate , which you used by the card orders , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example for a applications that have been used for copies of text .
all four order types are working on maintenance @-@ long , with the exception of the Screen Re@@ aders . if a application uses the issue of a screen Re@@ aders , the output of a screen Re@@ aders will be given , while an application will keep this output and finished .
first you need to know that filters never be applied to the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ eda . you &apos;ll be applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text points as well as &amp; k@@ de ; - News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; filter cartridges the text and enter it on the next filter . at the moment we are three types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
character files are replaced by text or regular expressions ; they can either be saved as words or regular expressions ; it is defined by text or regular expressions like : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of news from &amp; accounts ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; Re@@ duc@@ er use a XSL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ actions ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . are some XSL@@ T files to translate into &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can filter jobs depend on the content of text or depending on the program , sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can read text from K@@ DE news about it .
each of these various filters has sel@@ ectable rules for which he is applied for a language output . if the filter ensures that his rules does not correspond to the next filter .
when a text search , a message , warning or a k@@ de ; send notification on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be sent to all activated filter , which is arranged on the page below . the processing is made by the filter by the filter in the list below .
this shows the list of a furnished normal filter . this is not enabled , it is not activated and will not be used . filter will work according to the bottom upwards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be displayed on the following pages .
a list of words or regular expressions are considered as a comparison of words or regular expressions . if these patterns are found in text , the text will be replaced by the corresponding replacement parts . large and small quantities are considered to be compared with comparison .
for your filters a name . these names you can choose from the name of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter is similar to the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the strings of the column .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to edit the current list or delete the list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
is here a language that is only applied when the speaker is only applied for the text order , click on the button to specify a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the mouse click the button . button pressed down .
if a value is entered , the filter is only applied when the text from one of the given applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as , for example : Con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application ID execution programs can be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; DB@@ us ; -@@ Num@@ bers must be taken away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only enter copies .
the string check filter is used only on the text when all conditions are used with one entry in the box This filters can apply to all texts . these are all input parameters , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the string check filter regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. &quot; words have to be limited to both sides ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no manual to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can use it in the analog execution or edit the help of these expressions .
&amp; XML ; Re@@ duc@@ ers &amp; XML ; using XSL@@ T files from a format in another format . XSL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ actions ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such changes . it can only be used on a well @-@ formed XML file .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ ATH enough , even x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the intercom filters you can send text to a certain spokes@@ person on the card card or an speaker with certain attributes . you can specify that texts by k@@ mail of a female voice will be read .
before you can send a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker , which indicates the text on &amp; kt@@ ts .
if the text is applied , the filter is used , if the text is applied to the given regular expression . it is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can use this with one click on the button to receive the button .
in order to achieve a faster application , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
put here the properties of the speaker at the top of the specified filter conditions . if the text is selected , the speaker is selected which corresponds to the desired requirements at the right . click on the button to view the dialog selection .
use these buttons to save your intercom settings or delete all settings or settings .
the intercom filters can only be applied to the text when all conditions are used with one entry in the box . they must apply at least one condition .
the language output API , by &amp; k@@ en ; , with programm@@ ers to lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; DB@@ us .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that syn@@ thes@@ es can use this syn@@ thesizer .

I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but with the use of the module for the festival .
with a bug in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ Browser , so that you do not have to use this voice to read other websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found via the ambient variable P@@ ATH .
certain signs or intercultural characters seem to cause error in syn@@ thesizer , so all phrases have over@@ looked or just du@@ g . what can I do ?
imagine that the option character set is set to the appropriate language for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these might be corrected using a string query filter .

to compens@@ ate , you need to include a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 1.1 or newer ) including the Pack@@ ages and the Develop@@ ers .
if you have the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you can , check the sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ript with your language syn@@ thesizer . in this way you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ript sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; gt ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is the first version of the offering . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed , that the establishment of it @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is not needed anymore .
a long text is broken into individual sets . the user can return to the stat@@ ute or object references , to repeat the output or gain .
if an application is selected , you can specify the attributes of the preferred selection for the output . if you have a speaker , the language English and the sex female is used , this is automatically written by the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see in after .
if you click on the card card or to click on the card or click on the list , the card card system of the module will appear in the following example , will be displayed on the modules of the module for the modules .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to the festival in P@@ ATH you &apos;ll have to enter the festival .
choose the character string for text that will be delivered to festival . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 are used , Eastern languages , French or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sliders , you get volume , voice speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select some control and these grey will not be displayed , the selected voice will not be shown from you .
some parts such as multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded because of their size of several seconds . if you load this tick field , these quotes will be loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is qui@@ cker if the first set is faster .
if this address is not selected , you have not created any speaker ( or forgot to contact ) . see below .
is this anchor box , when start from kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window panel is displayed , otherwise it is visible after the start of the start page , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this cruci@@ ally selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is still running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is given a text in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD , you have the possibility to control the pre @-@ reading or otherwise .
here are all orders in the queu@@ e , together with the application that set the assignment to the order of the assignment , the number of sets and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the map ID on the map .
with the buttons in this series you can specify the order in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several lines ) .
with one click on OK , all modifications of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will become a symbol in the system section . click on this icon to view the program window .

the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of these are not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works at you .
on this map card you can request special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; gt ; processed four types of language orders :
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ eda has the highest priority . you will read all other orders and keeps these orders . after the issue of the screen reader , the selected orders will be recorded again .
war@@ nings have been priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . one warning holds the output of news and nor@@ mal@@ in text .
News offers the next priority . if you are not only a long text on a website , you can read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; blo@@ cked ; nevertheless you will welcome you straight to the room .
if a text search is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ ing long .
this audio file is always played when a normal text is interrupted . if both single sound is active as well @-@ conduc@@ tive message , the single sound is played before the end of the message .
the settings on this card reader apply only for normal text points . for news , war@@ nings and issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .

use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button , select a dialog where you want to add the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the news from the news that call &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; instead , if someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message will be mentioned in the Nick@@ name .
all events that is specified in the list is not specified by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; t@@ ts are to do when an event comes . you have the following selection options :
if you read user defined text , specify the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired translation . standard select the speaker , which is shown in the list of card versions as top entry .
note that there is three levels for events . is defined for a specific event of a certain application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed by default ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events can &apos;t be deleted from the list . you can specify the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button to store settings for the aler@@ ts in a file . if you want to start the button to download it out of a file . if you want to begin with a empty list , click Delete . all items may be removed from the list .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for the control of voices , the voice of voice , the voice of voice , the voice of voice . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3C standard .
at the same time , SS@@ ML is only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ ding male ) , as this is the default voice is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound system in the festival configuration dialog doesn &apos;t set up to 100@@ .00 ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to have the same layout on the site . I &apos;ve been using it for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ us@@ hing filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . it is possible to start reading text in individual sets , because only the first set of synthetic data is not only supported by the previous phrase , because it is not directly supported by the card product , even if the language syn@@ thesizer are not directly supported .
you can also add product news , press releases , events and vac@@ ancies completely free of charge
at the simpl@@ est you will learn the setup of the intercom selection and try text to read and write Text . check out the selection selection and check the text as a speaker as a speaker , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; nbsp ; then faster with the pre @-@ start , there is only the first set to be processed and not the whole text which can last a long time ,
you can keep copies of orders on map card or even if the language syn@@ thesizer will not support this function .
for this reason , the normal stat@@ us@@ hing filter is set automatically if you start catching up for the first time . it can &apos;t be switched off , just away . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do .
we compare text with a regular expression for the stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ul@@ ators ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the stat@@ utes ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ notify ) , war@@ nings , News or output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ eda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the description of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; character filter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can add this again by clicking the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card selection can be displayed on the map data . the card card is displayed when calcul@@ ating the card card .
using the default speaker ( the top on the card card ) . with other words : there are no intercom properties available .
when you choose the intercom phone , you won &apos;t delete all the features of a furnished intercom . if you choose the settings of the intercom will not delete or edit , this speaker is selected . otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the voice of which corresponds to the originally designated properties .
select the method to input the archive properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the requested office . if this property doesn &apos;t play a role , give it nothing .
select the cruci@@ fix@@ ion when the property has priority to other properties . you can also put several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is described in a critical factor in the output of the output , this property is rarely used . the only case , in which you probably want to specify the attributes of the language , if you know that a certain application will be entered into a different language than that in the environment .
in order to use all properties in the field of speaker , which corresponds to the following below , click on the selection button and then use speaker , which corresponds to the following below .
in this case there is 0 for the last word reservation in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without any order number is required ) .

the audio output via al@@ sa does not work when I am at the same time with any other application . if I have a text order , it appears to be a message that dar@@ es : to open PC@@ M .

on the card card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program So@@ x install and install the ambient variable P@@ ATH , such as Festival Interactive as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored when &amp; regi@@ ts ; and HTML ; it is that the HTML will be converted into SS@@ ML file . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting your HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML file , and set the output speed up .
I do not believe that web pages with a female voice will be read . I have created a female festival speaker and read the web pages with a male voice .
with festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able Democracy seems to work with the Best Error . so the festival does not produced a bug that th@@ rows the x@@ sl file to convert SS@@ ML to SA@@ BER the Gender tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have been added to your own query filter , and now I can get back in &amp; kt@@ ts , not anymore . on the cardboard box is displayed , the order will be made just out of one set . what do I wrong ?
at the point of view , question marks , question mark , abstra@@ ctions , com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not use filters for this character instead of the character detection .

some users experience in connection with al@@ sa conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not read the music playing and read the text . &amp; gt ; and if you have a text order , you will find a further solutions for this problem you will find on the website of al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) .
with last July 2005 , Ko@@ de still does not have any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read yet .

before you can , check first , check whether your language syn@@ thesizer . follow the instructions that you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , its source code is generally well , and there are several voices and languages .
you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . do you want to read other web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ Browser .
for these quotes , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations .
check the voice in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ Browser . select a ky@@ ri@@ lli@@ um ( 8 bit@@ - ) code for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; you are looking for festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option of code should be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option to set encoding to a 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ lli@@ um such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then takes place the lex@@ ical analysis and mb@@ ro@@ la ; the program and mb@@ ro@@ la ; programs and the mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no full translation system is generated . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language from Di@@ verses files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone files .
in this procedure , additional Wra@@ pper Code to Festival is added to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ votes are not installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ file to be installed , but in the folder festival / lib / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the manual control interface , which allows the administration of the network interface , rout@@ ings and DNA settings .
das &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage the management of a number of system and Des@@ kt@@ op@@ tions@@ via a uniform , integrated surface . it can be called via K Menu to contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ center ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configure , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all shows and setting the network characteristics .
in most cases device drivers are added to the network hardware and other devices in the Inst@@ all &amp; Linux ; you have added network devices later , the driver will be loaded with the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when the option of network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module settings , this module will be automatically detect automatically .
if the platform does not recognize the platform , the hanging choice can be recognized as well . it is the platform from the list to choose the distribution and the one entry point . by means of setting the setting the network settings can then be made automatically . when you start the network settings , this selection is automatically set automatically .
the change of the network settings can be shown in the system administration mode . previously , all options are depicted , which means that the settings can only be considered . in the system administration mode , you will reach the bottom end of the module . it is the entry of the password is required .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three rider :
the Mi@@ G Network Interface are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices will display the following tasks :
the settings can be changed by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button in the list and click the button in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button on the button on the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection of the TCP / IP settings , the TCP / IP settings can be saved by a D@@ H@@ CP Server or BOO@@ TP Server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are sends all the required TCP / IP information in any system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list can be selected using D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system .
the input field IP address is required to specify the TCP / IP address . the input field IP address is required to specify the TCP / IP address .
this is required to initi@@ alize the system the network interface during the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization does not wish , this option should not be activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog box will be shown in this dialog box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network . insert an TCP / IP conflict . with ping in &amp; Con@@ sole , you can find whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the administrator should be needed .
network devices can be activated or switched off , switched off or switched off . switch off the up@@ stream network device by selecting the list and click on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off or switched off . switch off the activated network device by selecting the list and click on the interface .
the IP address of the machine at the local sub@@ network , the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with networks in other sub@@ n@@ ets .
when on computer more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network , in which the gat@@ eway is selected .
a calcul@@ ator with DNS support will be replaced with the corresponding IP address . that is necessary because computer is only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org calls for this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 6@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the name is part of the rich name solution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be removed by selecting a declaration and return in the list with the buttons or return to the priority .
when clicking on the button to add ... from the group you can add a DNS server to add a DNS server . it will add the dialogue of the new name server .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button to add . the entry will be added in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name , select one entry and click on the button editing .... It is displayed on the Edit menu .
the name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the name @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it will be used in first line with the bo@@ oting when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , DNS server can replace the DNS server .
normally , the list contains few names that support &amp; A@@ pos ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v6 addresses will assist you in the test version of IP is in the future version 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; add the IP address of the known machine and click Edit ... The dialogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to add &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the known machine enter and the button will add more . if the well known machine has several alias the names , button Add images and enter the other also known as the names .
select one entry of a name from the list and choose to edit ... The dialog box will be displayed .
it can be executed on the following tasks , then click the list of the static host@@ s .
the settings of the network settings are not immediately implemented in system settings . to enable the changes to enable the changes , in one &amp; con@@ sole , the following command will be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ host@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of source file .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
the installation of the complete complete version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and install the As@@ surance package , as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but also the development of development with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile . the following commands should be made .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network sites is given in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this section can not replace the knowledge of IP networks . in this anne@@ x , basic information about the PCs are taught in a small ( home ) network .
at present , IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 has never been installed . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , am &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administrator , which is a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be selected at any time !
the IP address should not be selected from a special small ( Home ) network , the IP address should not be selected from a specially designed for these purpose . the addresses from the table below are not transferred to the Internet .
of course , the access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is suitable for networks up to 250 computers big enough .
in addition , the net mas@@ ks are mostly set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all host participants are available in the same sub network .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 2 ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that needs two @-@ minute the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route will be required for the IP line .
the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is designated as a closed circuit , which works like a closed circuit .
in this part , the configuration files generated by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; have been affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered with DSL connections , so that it doesn &apos;t be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections a different content is determined there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts of Su@@ SE@@ X@@ config . another state is expected .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a safe program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band . the first one was to create a surface for the rapid , sel@@ ective acc@@ ents . the second goal was the responsibility of a question which my wife is : how much longer takes it ?
before a band can be used , it must be implemented by &amp; k@@ dat . that can happen at three types :
&amp; k@@ dat ; take the band back and read the pre@@ ten@@ sive information of the band . recogni@@ zes that the tape do not be , you &apos;ll be asked if the band will be form@@ atted .
recogni@@ z@@ able &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ aching , searches after the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the Band@@ index is re @-@ created .

in front of the belt , the band must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this too .
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of symbol tools to realize that the band has been solved for the band and displays a corresponding message . the band can now be changed without danger .
before a band from &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be deleted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted .
a band types must be form@@ atted before you can be used for saving data . this process is not one of the form@@ atting argument in &amp; k@@ dat .
after entering the band name and capacity of the band , the band is lost , with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the band will be lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process the band will be loaded automatically and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you &apos;ll need to select the stored files . that can happen on three types :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will be backed by a file or the folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . it will only be saved in the profile given in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with slices . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click the mouse button to the local file tree and select the Sich@@ art menu in the menu .
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in that dialog you can see even the selected files and the settings for safegu@@ arding backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialogue displays , the dialogue displays the progress of the backup process , including data rate and remaining time .
select a file or a folder in one of the archives for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or the folder .
select the files in one of the archives for the band with a sn@@ aking . it will only be checked for selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the Menu for testing ....
once the test setup is started , the dialog settings is started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and the working folders for the checking .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will display the dialogue . this dialog shows the progress of the examination as well as the date point rate and the remaining time .
before you can guide the recover , you need to recover the files that will be restored . this can be made on two types :
select a file or a folder in one of the archives available for the tape version . it will only be made for selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives . it will only be restored to the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on the right mouse button to select a folder or a folder in one of the archives , select the menu .
once the recovery process is started , the dialog settings is started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and the working folders for the recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog has been re@@ confirmed . this dialog shows the progress of the reconstruction process as well as the date point rate and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band &apos;s band file using the band &apos;s tape using the tape recorder . you can create the index on two kinds of bands from the band :
this allows a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can create a backup profile for the following settings :
the current work folders are automatically updated in which the backup will be automatically updated .
for all the folders that are stored under backup files , which are stored on the same file system , that can be used on the same file system as the folder that can be used on other file systems , you can be separately ordered under backup files .
to determine which files are changed since the last inc@@ re@@ ment@@ ation@@ backup option , a snap fixing file will be modified to have changed the files that have changed .
the name of the file that is used for the definition of changes since the last inc@@ iner@@ ation use .
del@@ etes the snap @-@ in file before the call of tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new flash file for the next backup will be created .

the settings can be configured via the menu item menu on the menu item menu . the following settings can be changed :
the complete path to device type ( normally / dev / net ) . this path must also refer to the non @-@ re@@ actor version of the band unit .
if the band is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the band is integrated into the drive . for some drives it is necessary before reading and write operations .
if the option is on , the option is switched off &amp; k@@ ite ; possibly it does not work with all the belt drives .
if the option is switched on , the integration of &amp; k@@ dat will be subject automatically . use this option to insert the flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ er .
if the option is on , try &amp; dat , the hardware war@@ nings to change the disk size for the band speed . no matter whether these setting is active or not , you need to be able to create a block size for your tape .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format is form@@ atted , writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only appear on the band . the content of the file is divided into :
( n byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this drawing is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where you name the complete name of the system , the number of seconds , which has been passed since the epo@@ ch in which the band has been form@@ atted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure style archive that can be directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other applications should work , as long as it doesn &apos;t exist .
check the content of a safety band . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; - viewer for system prot@@ otyp@@ ing . the program is intended for un@@ authorized users to obtain information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files .
&amp; k@@ log log ; helps users understand what your machine is in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ comfortable users that can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system files are depos@@ ited via your system .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users with information about problems which may occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; therefore , some extended functions can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ log log ; a number of useful functions . includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the Sys@@ log server and Samba
many other features are also included in addition and are explained in other capit@@ als of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen screens@@ hot , &amp; k@@ log log ; functions available , with their help you can filter the individual protocol type of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start is trying to open a system log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll . the protocol files are usually displayed in Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for normal users , usually do not include any permission for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar to filter the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter . then the protocol will only appear if in one of the columns in the columns defined by the filter .
you can also select a different entry on this site . select the character set of the filter search by selecting the name of a process , and contribute to the name of a process , then shows you &amp; k@@ system log ; all Protocol lines are sent to you by this process .
this option is activated in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with an increase of the protocol lines . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
you would like to show some specific process ( e.g. in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or in C@@ ron Protocol ) , this can be useful when you book the output of a certain commands like e.g. for the start of the Samba server .
in addition , you can activate the new lines in the context menu on the main menu to show all the new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub @-@ folders . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open additional sub windows and select a protocol in the menu , select a protocol in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system log ; has an own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system log ;

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a couple of concepts and describes what you can with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it developed quickly to the standard for control of the program track in the flood of the system in the &amp; Linux ; so because it is easier to use powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not be interested in history of historical aspects ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know about it , - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . This is therefore important because perhaps someone might try to connect a machine to System V In@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ format .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d . see r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
if you need a script for each system service , you need to do a script for each system service which you wish to start at the high level of system or when changing on a other run@@ level . system services include these things like set@@ serial , which just started once started .
r@@ c.@@ local should be part of / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . the most systems have this file , even if it is not much use for this file , even if it is not much use for this file . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ driver in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection .
the kernel searches in various places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the default font is in / etc / in@@ it@@ one@@ . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the run@@ level 3 is to change , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ data of hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you want to restart the system and then run it using the system :
but how start it all the correct script ? if you enter it -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there is no right files . instead , every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory of in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
as starts and stops in@@ it actually , system services ? quite easy : each of the script is written so that it is a argument like start and stop . you can start this script in the command line :
this would keep the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains the name , the script will stop the argument with the argument . when it comes to a S , the script will be called the argument with the argument .
some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could also have a user of Run@@ level , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . you should not be difficult because the program is so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simply not to say tri@@ fl@@ es : simply put one entry out of the available system services to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts between Run@@ ewi@@ n &apos;s position or position within one levels by making it elsewhere . this is only then if they draw one entry from the field of the available system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you have to copy this in a new area . to copy it to a new Run@@ level , you need to choose copying from the menu or to the target area -- even if the same entry has already exists in the target range of action .
the sorting number of a contract can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the Sor@@ ti@@ la@@ sis of the surrounding items before you try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries which have been thrown into the rec@@ ycle bin . be careful .
you can use the tab@@ oo button to enable the various workflow system ( able system services , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc . ) and the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous version .
to move an entry into another run@@ level . move it into the cli@@ pboard ( you can use Ctrl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with Ctrl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually , press the button button to change the properties dialog box to accept the changes in order to accept changes to change the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu is a confirmation before they will be executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
if you would like to experiment with the standard Run@@ ewi@@ n and now start the machine . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ data and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be right ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc which are available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the kind of system services will be started in this distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary use of this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan a extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution : please check whether all configuration files are needed ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) will end up without sending messages when their configuration files not available or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to version , even from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send us information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is posted on &amp; gt ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
once you have done changes , you need to save this file . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool box or entry in the menu .
the main window is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and user set list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some card cards will only appear if you have advanced system settings . if you have to have advanced system settings , you can have a card card that you can create individual settings , if shadow passwords can be displayed in BSD ( passwords , e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd ) as in BSD .
the card card will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD .
this card card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( reco@@ vers on the file system ) .
this parameter can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system .
the card card groups may be informed about group ownership of the user &apos;s group . the standard group , to the user , you can find in the field of Prim@@ ur group . furthermore , users can mark the user in other groups of the field .
the dialogue properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add images from the menu or group or click the appropriate button button . the Edit or delete the selected user and the selected group functions .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO File Manager , add the boot password , remove the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system that add the default system to remove , change operating systems , change operating systems , change , and more .
