<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity is an overvoltage protection. this is a tool that absorbing a part of the energy storage and the rest. it is usually in shape of a plug-in bar. remember that not every plug-in is also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then please make sure that it protects the UL 1449 Standard. this guarantees a particular minimum of protection. you should also note that he protects the protection against lightning and thus protects the right devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because an overvoltage of each cable can use any cable to your computer, you should be sure that all peripherals are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, which can also be connected to your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have an notebook, you will require a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore they are also the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for your trip.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system will protect your system above small fluctuations in the power lines, it will not help you to invest in a complete loss of unwanted data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a low-free supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against excess extensions, these devices can be automatically run automatically when a power loss. this gives you the opportunity to save your data and the system. if you have a UPS, you should be sure that they get the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risks associated with your computer system and compare with the costs for this. a high level of high-quality overvoltage protection can be reduced by up to & euro; 40. this is only a smaller price difference if you think about it.</seg>

<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), photo (Yahoo) and photo-Community 23hq.com offers online storage services that are available to you. your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not want to get your pictures not in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the Web solutions are automatically adjusted to the TCP protocol, and the large companies are included in the offer a backup and a partial memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission ratio in the machine. all the transfer is susceptible to transfer errors. the file system sends and btrfs at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells us if a transmission does not occur in your hardware. it's quite undisturbed that there is no protection against you. it's pretty sure that there is no protection against your computer. no one seems to be thought about it. the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer database away than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are another source of transmission ratio as they create interruptions within the data streams. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not interested in transfer technologies, you should look at the future. in 2010, you will see a lot of errors per year.</seg>

<seg id="208">You don't understand this, these two factors are responsible for 86% of data losses, with notebooks and 46% at the workload. in notebooks, the proportion of the theft will be 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most common. it leads to a lower damage, e.g. theft, or new installations, and it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; it has been no longer a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is a minimally better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupts data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during surgery is higher and a undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main cause for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 blessings of a fundamental physical limitations. meaning that technology has further developed a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characterization for all types of light sensors are no longer removed from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras are available in the direction of the 10 megapixelsensors. the sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimally important for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a maximum size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive today have been responsible for 100 & euro. so you do not backup any other data loss in any year of data loss. so you save your data often after a plan and test this backup before you use any more dangerous as the new installation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size change from hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Do you use daily your backup on an external SATA drive. if one day, a flash maker you've been associated if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A desaster must be local and destroys a lot. do flight routes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft, are usually a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, destitute does not require local storage. do you bring the stairs to the stairs, in your neighborhood house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above above is a common reason for a data loss in spite of backup the Panic. if you have a backup, that is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be secured. it is a momentary recording without histories and provides a complete copy at one point.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete complete backup process. the complete moments of the complete protection and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental security: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. you can easily integrate the original status to any time. this backup comes from a versionary system on the next to which it is only abastet and no longer.</seg>
<seg id="223">Sync is a wonderful tool that you can set easily on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer Authenticing sync only the difference of files that really changed. this happens to compressed and when you want to increase your safety via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another oppositional medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure will give you enough time to discover losses and make use. at the same time, you have a complete day of the last 7-14 days, a weekly momentary recording for at least one month and a momentary recording for every month. each other output should be done, after which you have made a complete test.</seg>

<seg id="227">With this valuable pictures you will survive the next 40 year, that is about the time period in you are really interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future due to your nature unpredictably you need to know everything today. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain storms. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to evaluate as the current system backwards.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays for everyone. if you have an old system that you should know about your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other side, the Council is quite simple: jedestimes if you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. stay on open standards.</seg>

<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression salms (default late). there are many different types and not all applications can work with all types of applications.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Betative file format is a license free and open source format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obliged to use the camera in the format.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why to replace Adobe its XML based XMP technology, which allows users to embed their data in a file itself. XMP is a label of XML and RDF. it is a label of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. it is a key component of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers go to a original of your recording, mostly in raw format, but can come back separately from the image file. it can be used to use the metadata between the metadata and the image file, and how you use the raw format, so you should consider it if you use DNG as containers and keep it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that allows for fully compatible online metadata standards that provides an extensive range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI system, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>

<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixel is generally not as fast as green and red. & nbsp; and dystw will try to reconstruct the missing green and red volumes from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how many color or white you want.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you have a coloured workflow integrated into the colors of your camera or scanners have a predictable deviation from the fact that you can print out the colors of your camera or scanners and the colors that meet you with your camera or scanners.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic of color management is coming, everybody wants to press and press the results of the results. unfortunately, colour management must be available to each point of the image processing workflows. in addition, the sense of this tutorials is to give you sufficient background information about ink administration. in addition, you will be able to make your own informational choices that you will receive the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows all six below is fulfilled, you must not take care of colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working at a monitor of the sRGB colour gamut. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are based on e-mail or the web, where sRGB the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">If the RGB so well works and the life for all so easy, why should you use another colour gamut and do not need to make thoughts about color paces?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the leRGB compared to the colors which we really see below is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeits-shaped region, and the colors in the RGB colour gamut, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour surfaces, you visit Bruce Lindbloc VAT and click on information and then click Information About the RGB contents.</seg>
<seg id="385">If I want to reset my monitor if I decided to work with the RGB colour gamut.</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you work in the sRGB colour gamma or not, you need to reset your monitor if the RGB function is reset, then you need to insert your monitor on the sRGB template.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool represents five automatic corrections that may improve the image in most cases. if you use it, before selecting a further manual process.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same as automatic and contrast contrast from the menu Korrigation Automatic correction are automatically deleted from your color. they are to experiment with these effects. they are like to experiment with these effects. they are like to see what's best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scalable with the entire image, so that the dark spot is black and the light point as light as possible without its color shading. this function is often a stomach correction for images that are dark or low.</seg>
<seg id="391">At the same time this method supports the lighthouse of the selected images, so that the histogram's intensity is as flat as flat as flat as possible. this has a very good results when improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes there is also a very powerful operation which can either be found in an image or it destroys.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic loading: this method is maximized to the color range in the red, green and blueprint. you obtained the dark and bright borders of red, green and blueprints on the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of a picture by means of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new jibs of all values. this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White bordered of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to carry the white torch of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white abject correction is somewhat limited because of a colour gamut with 8-bit per color. if you can work out far from the original picture. if you can work out from the original picture, in case of the white mode, your possibilities are going to be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white degradation algorithm in the copyright by Pawel T. Jochanan. it will start using the Menu to the Gold page and you can drag the images (folder) to the top of the page.</seg>
<seg id="397">The display mannequin can be adjusted in size. you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will see dynamic the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original version, it will then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview photos features a red Marker. the Luminance of the Pixels is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top of the top, a histogram is shown that dynamic changes will change when you bet an parameter. you decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, calories and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the scattendance of your photos or also.</seg>
<seg id="401">Check the above mentioned above mentioned, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white content. this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white back with the list of the settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overpower indiator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is displayed. this is shown as pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">In order to store the buttons as well as loading this. any setting of the white, you can save you in a text file and later reload.</seg>
<seg id="405">"" "the" "" "button" "" "button allows the filter values to your standard values and the related neutrality. note that neutral settings will be another different photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth of each color channel of the selected images. 8-bit code is the widely available JPEG format, 16 bit code is better for high quality images. this code is needed, but also more disk space, computing time and can be done for the formats PNG, pnm, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the machining of raw images. it uses the change and transfer of colour profiles. a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be applied to the use of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors audio channels. this tool provides a built-in menu to adjust several colour channels. this is useful when your camera or your scanner are always use the same error and you always do the same corrections in the manual you need to find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility for correctness is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The product portfolio includes four colour effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velotechnik filter, a Neon effect and a cantonal filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, solar cells, even Sabatier was called, a effect of a short flash, and after the development of the picture. the result was a partial negligence of the picture. the result was a partial negligence of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect on this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity is controlled by the solar cells. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible is to create a negative image that is not to produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar generator. the original image is the (1) and edited (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaque; -effect. it differs from a scouring that he makes a stronger contrast effect that he makes the colour brilliant and smooth. try it, he runs many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquet; the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquet; and a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors, but also some photographs which are hardly surprising.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilters simulates Neonlight at the contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the layer of repetitions the strength of the Neonite. in large images the filters can relieve the entire CPU for one moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have common problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to change the colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu. as soon as you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">When you make a photo of bad lighting, you can reduce the reverse problem: there is a great choice for Brightness / Sättel. also in this case the tool allows you to see in a preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated for improvement of the exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool is very complicated, you need to explain what you're looking for here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active edge or the selected area. under the graphs below are three sliders into the bottom and be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left-left hand represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn to learn the control is the regulator to move the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can see the original and preview of the picture. the preview will be dynamic, using the settings of the picture, updated on the left-hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera is common, the linear depicting of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the middle for the middle tones, often gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image in order to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, middle and bright colours automatically.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow to change the selection values for each area. the compression values can be used to change the output values for example. the compression values can be used to create the output values for example. the compression values can be used to create a hidden picture as background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: the image values are set automatically, depending on the intensity values of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons can be stored in the file system and later reload the Gimp levels.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use these mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will be automatically detected automatically for all shadows, means and solar panels. check the color pipette you want and click on the preview of the original image to insert the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of an indicator is controlled all color channels to display overflow pixel and to show you the results of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, an example of the adjustment parameters can be applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, half of the originals and the target is displayed. the preview will be dynamic in dependence on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified Channel: this selector box allows the channel to allow the channel to change the module.</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are recorded by linear and a logarithmic view. for images with a digital camera, usually the linear mode of the linear mode is the logical mode of the linear mode. in this case it helps the logarithmic mode.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move like a cursor to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that this bright tones with dark output levels and the associated image noise can be darker darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos you will see a red mark on the field. if you want to change this marking on the curve, a matching line on the curve shows the original value. create a point on this line and move it up, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: using these buttons, you can configure exactly this. each curve can be stored in the file system and later be charged. the file format is the Gimp Short venformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pickers automatically generate the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, Central and Sonnentöne. check the color pipette you want and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blueprint and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of transfer indikator controls all color channels to overhauled pixels. if in more than one channel, it is an indicator that you get the effect only in a preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black white photo that was placed in the luminance canal. shadow and Sonnentöne was applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>

<seg id="442">You can drag the images (folder) to the jQuery Slider window. you can drag the images (folder) to the top of the jQuery Slider window.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel spacing box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you an initial reference to you by using the relative distribution and distribution. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to their own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target is a red Marker. when you positioning this in picture, a vertical line is displayed in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controller for Red, Green and construction allow you to combine these channels. if you also keep the corresponding colour components, this is especially convenient if you also enable the corresponding colour components. this is especially convenient if you also enable the corresponding colour components. this is especially convenient if you also enable the appropriate color components. this is especially convenient if you are also the option of monochrome. this is a great tool for creating great black white conversion of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black or white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a visible space, which looks like a visible space, which looks like a colour channel which looks like a colour channel. if this is the case you can reduce your monochrome. in this way you can reduce your monochrome. in this way you can reduce your monochrome. in this way you can reduce your monochrome.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and loading buttons are exactly used for this purposes. any kind of mixer selection can be used for later and then load. the use file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of an indicator is controlled all color channels to display overflow pixel and to show you the results of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect when the final result is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="461">You can also add product news, press releases, events and vacancies completely free of charge</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer's eye to keep the limits of a photos is no easy task. it is an opportunity to keep the image a decorative frame. this is an psychological barrier for the spreader. under the frame, the module can be started using the window.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the frame type for your image. with a thin line, rivepce cover it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), embossed it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: are the width of the frame in percent. the value segment is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The frame design is larger than the original, but the same side effects are bigger. this is important for the pressure of the images, especially if you have used the tool after the page.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text in a picture. this is also important for several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text area, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its properties as you need them. you will simply choose an frame to select the text and / or a semi transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK. after the image has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitization, tool, you can specify a template for a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">Or you can drag the images (folder) to the jquery gallery with swf jQuery Gallery window.</seg>
<seg id="471">There are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and to work with maximum compression (9) to the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to send an e-mail in English to the & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to set your range folder with the button square folders. select the folder where you are copied to the highest folders. these settings are created for the next launch.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitization, three different tool for carbide saws. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpens is a traditional tool for carbide. it is very quickly and simple, but produces especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unshark mask works on the contrast of edges to create an image sharpen. it's no bit, it works better to remove the atmospheric Dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocrine is probably the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. he is a bit complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures will require a correctional process. this leads to a common colour with just minimal differences. the same phenomenon allows sharp edges to be printed on paper. SLR cameras are usually more than normal cameras for private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">Using JPEG image, a camera is often applied to a camera. pictures in raw format you need to be moved during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already installed during the image of the picture. if you deactivate this deactivate, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you may find useful results by clicking on a photo with the sharpening tool.</seg>
<seg id="487">It should be careful because the results are not very natural: the focus will be increased the edge of the edges, but also the noise. in general, it is the most expensive technology for the sharpening of a picture of Refokussies. you can reach further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too scarce. the solution to record the picture a bit soft is much easier than it. use the tool for soft to sharpen and experiment with settings. the buttons on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp edges is a very good tool to remove slipping from your photos. a demonstration allows you to see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help to edit the image. the device display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the Radius and the amount. the default values are often generate good results and should first be used. if you create the unsharpening mask, smokers and the impression of dimples are placed in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The Radius produces a like many pixels on each side of each side by the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radius. you should therefore sharpen images at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount specified between the original and the wiches picture is added to the original. therefore the strength of the edge is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a breaking out of the maximum RGB value and apply-to-amount. it is possible to define a minimum difference between the tones from the sharpen from the sharpening from the sharpen and therefore the beauty changes in faces, heavens and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the irradiated filter. the original image is the (1) and processed by radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digitization of the digitization of digitization is achieved by improving the edge of the tool. it uses the copyright protected protected Discreatic filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to make a picture of & quot; refusing the Defokussies. this is a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique of images is achieved. Refokussies have achieved better results when you start using Colokussies in the window.</seg>
<seg id="498">In the practice, the circular thread is much better than the palaces. the palate'sche frogs has a very long tail, which leads far from the source. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the palate is influenced by far away from the original pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">It is the most important parameter for use this module. it is the most important parameter for use this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation may help recover artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of noise filter can help you avoid artifacts. however, the filter can be too low as 0.1 mg. however, the noise filter can be too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's focus: this is the radius for the Gauß. if you use this value to 0, in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value to 0, you may also increase the correlation and / oderous noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">This value determines the size of the transformer size. an increase of matrimal size may have a good results, especially when you select large values for the circular edge or the palaces. however, however, you should choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving and loading buttons are exactly used for this purposes. each other Refokussian parameters will be stored for later and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all zucchini, colour and intensity of intensity and the intensity of the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before creating the picture. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but they leave a pleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, irregularity is generally used as a focal point. this could be caused by the sharp edges of a larger neighborhood as an edge.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it must be impossible to remove artifacts. even under the optimum conditions, it is never possible to remove the effect of impeding filter. practically, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as well as the unsharpening mask. the FIR III filter is often better with processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unmistakable colour image must be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="514">Ink wraps allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool eye correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the required artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inducing algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different pre-settings to simplify the restorations. the available pre-settings are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter settings for settings, you can use the rider clearer and advanced settings.</seg>

<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this is defined as the maximum smoothing factor via the upper limit. set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">As a result, this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the greater it is necessary if a lot of noise. it is necessary if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulc effect, it is necessary higher than 3.</seg>

<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the More about quality that you get through the selection of this option is low. he doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons can be saved as well as loading this. any setting from picture errors can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very quickly when work. it can take a very long time and a high CPU load. therefore, you can use the calculator at any time with the button tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how many errors can be removed with Small Artefacts. the module is made on a photo that created in Guatemala city with an analogue camera. the original picture is created under (1) and correcting image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitization of the digitization is a very powerful tool to reduce vibrations. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool is selectable image filter available to remove marks and other artifacts, i.e. from dust or hair onto the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or Moirellas; effects from books or magazines too.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor technology from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial on English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shows the typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grasping noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you need only the subwindow details and the lower window settings can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the amount of filters per pixel, and the image is generated by the Radius area.</seg>
<seg id="536">This value is set at the edge of the filter by the filter by the filter. if it is increased, you need to change the edges of the filters. if the value is too high, the adaptive Filter image details are no longer available and noise or lubrication.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge-accuracy of the filter. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, you can remove it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controlled the fluorescent tolerances of the picture. we suggest you either to improve your color or light density in order to improve the image process by the details of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerances of the picture. we recommend you either to improve your color or light density in order to improve your image. this settings does not affect the smoothing process of the settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controlled the gamma tolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark sections, which typically are stronger to increase.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controlled the adjustment of the phase angle. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius to variations of light. when it is increased, the edges are smooth, if it is too high, the noise and phase of noise can be removed to the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons will be used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction your life can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture can be crisp for your purpose. the solution that gives a little soft to sharpener is much easier than an image to sharpener. use the tool to make the soft tab on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization is definitely one of the most developed tools for picartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filters are presented to you the opportunity to remove a lot undesired artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove the palate 'replacement parts, scratches, compression artefacts and local mistakes in the digital, original or the digitalized images, which makes the contents like it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures. the texture analysis is developed with another tool, the imaging function of the grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkrich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it produces some compression & quot; Artefacteer; - small standards that will be corrected on uncompressed image. this setting is to fix these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons can be stored as and store exactly this. any setting of photo restorations can be stored in a text file and later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quickly when work. it can take very long and take a high CPU load. therefore, you can use the calculator at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can see how a photo with equal noise is restored.. The module is applied to Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old colour photo which has been removed with a scanner. the original picture is found under (1) and correcting image under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It allows you to access it with a CCD camera with a CCD camera, and it uses it to be removed with a CCD camera, and it uses algorithms from the pixGPixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickinson.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw, because many cameras are equipped with JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel--and "quot; bright pixelated; on a photo with an dark image-trader method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the assistance via the Button. the tool will detect automatically the hot and bright colors. these are highlighted in the picture of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as in previous section, you should find the right dark image to correct image. an automatic processing of the dark pixels will be used. note that this assistant is the last dark image and this automatically closes in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and preview will help you correcting the result. the device display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixel are raised in all fields of fields.</seg>
<seg id="560">In order to see the defective pixels on the preview and see the results of the filter. select the best filter method to see these pixel blocks. these are the following filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durability: it is determined by an average of the neighbouring pixels. the same color is determined by all defaults in the block. for a 1-dimensionally interpolation, this will be separately ordered separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all Pixies have a distance of 1 from Pixelblock, for calculating a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear tubs (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are considered to calculate an bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) to calculate the pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubically: all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less can be pulled into order to calculate an bi-kubic surface (2-dim) or a group of kubical curves (1-dim) to calculate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can use the hotline correction on a colour photo, from an defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original picture was enlarged by 300% (1) and the correct image is under (2).</seg>

<seg id="567">Wide variety of objects, especially in the middle and large photo format, often illuminate the whole sensor area is not even illuminated. instead & quot; vignettierungs & quot; (shady) they reach the sensor there. teleobjective will also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when you need to hold a factor 1.5 or 2 when blood filter, which should be necessary to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle objects, even with center filters, a hole of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise incurable effects through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effects of a Centerfilter by digital cameras and film scanning, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the correct correction of correct filters and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter also controls the degree of light sensitivity at the point of the biggest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which reduce the density of an aperture of 1, or accidentally compensate the density to compensate the density to compensate for a larger degree of Vignettes, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettierite correction reduces the light intensity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target audience with these options, as you need to increase the settings only.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to use a fine new setup of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma / Gamma is zero and use the Gradation from the & digidation; you can drag the Gradation from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetration correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the itinerary in the corners and (2) the correct image. an leukment and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>

<seg id="629">A photo bladder is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The large question is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture-bubbles and the details of difficulty? how can you find the missing information you can find in a picture. how can you see the missing information or errorby? the CImg algorithm is here, makes it a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size using the tool size using the tool size. select the target values in the menu and enter the destination values.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size change a linear interpolation method to avoid the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitiation was developed by IMAGE team of grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>

<seg id="637">The buttons can be saved as well as loading. each insertion of photo can be stored as a text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shooting is very quick when it makes it, but it can take very long and a high CPU load after pulling up. you can easily pull the calculator at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bladder by a small colour image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged photo (3). the result (2) is the result of the linear dynamics to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The photo gallery is not just a common operation, but also a often underestimation tool to create a picture. you can simply cut the mouse with mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the mouse. you'll see this right mouse only while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you look back again, the area of the photos will be cut off again. this way you can look for a good overview of how your photo is cut off. you can create a good overview of your photo by clicking on the corners of the right place.</seg>
<seg id="642">You can also use the button window button to store the button button button in the tool box and the photo will be customized (Ctrl; + X). use the entries to save / save the photo.</seg>

<seg id="648">The tool must be cut to the side effects, depending on the image orientation (horizontally or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are displayed in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data is saved in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will be restored and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the compositions to help make it clear that you are better suited to your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle are based on the principle of the similarity. like the third-regel, harmonic triangles is aligned in a similarly harmonious triangles to the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a part of the various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of an Nautilus shell or the aperture of a sunflower. it occurs in all sorts of things which we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational Number of 18033988... and it has been used throughout the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who use your images, buildings and even photographs.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number of the fibonacci row 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 8, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34 and etc.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle is more fluid lines when you make a picture. these tips are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spirals will bring your goal good results to get closer to your photos. compared to third-third, this type of composition takes the look of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the rectangles of the golden spirals. it should be used to make the eye in the heart of the composition. it should be a line to be one line or different objects. it can be a line to be one or different objects. this something can be simply because without the eye, it will fulfill its function.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are likewise from the above mentioned gold spiral. in contrast to harmonic triangles, the sides of the sides are the sides of the golden rule. note that unlike the harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not even equarable triangles. diagonal to these lines can cause a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use the golden triangles to create your frame, create a effect of professional photography dynamic Symmetry. try your image focal points and other visual information in the triangle. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach different.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options are stored and reflect; to reflect the harmonious sub-structures.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the corresponding colour, you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are around a corner. you can also find this picture with the tool free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slide corners. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. the knob will be shown back on 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will appear on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help you find the free rotation of a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse into the picture show you can move it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now check the angle as in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have a shot, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to fix this is the function of the jQuery Slider window.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the complete range. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-Aliasing emulates the picture a bit after turning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perseverance transformations are carried out for a fixed point of the above reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">In order to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your picture. you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new picture, including the empty areas which were created by transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new picture, including the empty areas which have created by transformation.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the valley.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the valley.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the bottom left: shows the current angle in degrees below the lower left corner of the valley.</seg>
<seg id="675">At the bottom of the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the valley.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective of perspective, the image is a bit soiled. for individual adaptation is this effect small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">You can drag the images (folder) to the top corner of the jQuery Slider window. you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a portion of the picture in a direction to the left and the lower part of the left. this is not rotational, the picture is broken down.</seg>
<seg id="679">You can use horizontal and vertical angle at the same time. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press on default settings, the angle is shown on zero back. a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will create a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the mouse button to fix the lines. you can use the tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the picture, the image will be a bit caught. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible but two shots of the use is twice as long as you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">You can drag the images (folder) to the top corner of the jQuery Slider window.</seg>

<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file will be created to see the export page. navie information can be found on the export page.</seg>
<seg id="921">You can select which information can be displayed on the HTML page. if you are aware that information can be displayed on the HTML page. if you are exported all images from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML page will look like. most of the setup options are unique, which is why not specifically designed.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can make different resolutions for the pictures. thus, you need to view different resolutions and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site may change the resolution at any time or change the resolution at any time. it can also be your images with low resolution, which leads to a smaller transmission time.</seg>

<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if this is really all for viewer. if you select a URL to select a web browser, the URL you should select here, this folder should start here. otherwise the web browser will start the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">This allows you to copy the HTML files even in the final folder you need to copy it manually. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are.</seg>

<seg id="934">You can also add a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images that are found in the folder of the .kim file. the respective images are not found, the images of the URL you are looking for creating HTML files. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue for the exporting pictures you will receive via the file expo...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is to act whether it is to act internal or external .kim files. there are the following three selections options:</seg>
<seg id="938">When the option to copy in the .kim file you'll have to copy the images in the same folder like the .kim file.</seg>

<seg id="1042">When a picture is marked with only a beam of the pixel, different errors are often created. these images often have a moirè pattern or layer effects in curves and lines which are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally, pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"" "when you are off Anti-Aliasing," "" "& Povray" "" "is called super-sampling." ""</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighboring Pixies using the second method is adaptive because each pixel is again split and adaptively because the recursion depth of the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you select the first method, POV-Ray comes to the pixels. when the difference between the color values are calculated on 4, the pixel is calculated on 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams to the pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 stracts per pixel. when the difference between the color values the pre-defined threshold, the pixel will be checked individually. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted individually.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to increase the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the radiation process, Jittering. if you are off Jitching, changes & Povray; the beam to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final adjustment for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflex. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse of light reflex port is calculated. it takes place very long to calculate the scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can set if the Alpha channels is calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have no object.</seg>

<seg id="1083">You will often use these menus and symbols are often use, so you should remember the menu and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovModeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and select the menu in the menu. so you can now see the scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene which you create. in particular note the view of the camera from the camera. this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>

<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, but take note that the camera can change in the view point where you can change the target point of the camera. simply clicking on a control point and pull it to the desired point.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you turn the button fastening or the input file, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you may also insert a quader (inserting body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a fundamental method for the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovModeler: actually it offers a simpler system. you can use an infinite level as a floor.</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed soon.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model has now also shows the level at the moment, even at the moment only as limited place. if you renders the scene, the level runs through to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">In this case you will find that you can find the entry for the bottom, if you click on the icon + before the object. you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>

<seg id="1514">Under the Audio Formats, MP3 and OGG are most common. OGG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality with low bitrates (up to 128 kbps) but more than this bitrate the differences are less important since both Kodiver are very good audio quality.</seg>

<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music also belongs to other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should be acceptable for most people and most of most music pieces have acceptable transparency, and has already high quality. well enough for hi-stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a slightly less complex parts of the piece. well enough for hi-stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. don't need 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of an Titels. well enough for hi-stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"" "" "" "-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of an Titels. well Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autographeosystems. but not well enough for hi-hi-stereo devices." ""</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is most commonly used for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely don't want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information provided by the freeDB is automatically deleted by the freeDB on the Internet, are available as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used with & kaudiocreator: and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with the encoding programmes, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to explain the code for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the CD's title to the tables (english: day) to add MP3s with lame, the switch -tt should be added to lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks so from: '... tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameter that can be used (= button description in the assistance):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CD, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of the computer. it is to note that here only from text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of pieces & etc., not of the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I have not agree that it is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that you from the & CD; and also the information can be added to the CD; more or less value, so can not be added to the music by the CD; more or less value, so can neither be the artist nor the CD; business, physically or virtuoso.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; in this type of configuration, the e-mail address is not used in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used for retrieving the data from server (This is not only the programmability to know which code has been checked out.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">If & kaudiocreator is set in many countries of the main database. if & kaudiocreator is used to use the freeDB, the geographically used to use the freeDB is to be used for using freeDB. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of Spiegelungen for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the update of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reader program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know exactly in the source code.... This was always the best choice for the read of audio CD; it has to be aware that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the right distribution if this is not happen.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the shared WAV files, the Kodiers can be selected using the codec (MP3s), oggenc (OGFP) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the register card. other codiers can be added to the register card.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Kodiers can be used. further information about Kodiers are required in the chapters of Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a code, additional information about its switch can be obtained via the input as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console) must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have a lot of causes. check the setup of the device diagram of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reader the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGCC, FLAC & etc.). try to invoke both programs using a command line in a terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, this will give tips how to go.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, but somehow it is still unknown to do? Yes, no problem, follow this step-step example, and you will need enough information to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all set up and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps, average and ID3v1 sets (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. however, it is not necessary to compile the source files that you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is that you have access to copy (eg; by trying to copy a bit into a copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic input of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to the reading of a & CD; which must be repeated for each passing & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of using cography for compression of music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 bis 256 kbps). it is determined to use the files and the structure is used to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings, we will probably not be able to change them very likely to read one & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device problem is transferred to the toolkit using the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device-model of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed via the device with other programs, so helps you get a look into the file / etc / fstab and a try using the existing entries for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here are not much too do. here, there can be a additional conversion. in our example, everything will be shown in our example, in our example, will be shown as in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card reader CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow you to download the CD; data automatically by the Internet of a freeDB computer.</seg>

<seg id="1652">This is necessarily essential for synthesizer, which are not General MIDI files. in this case the MIDI device works in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI interface that allows all events of the type Change files to Trumpet, and thus has a trumpet sound when originally a piano play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, do not need MIDI interface because all soundcards is GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI files. you have to edit the appropriate file of your favorite (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI interface is a text file that supports all the needed requests for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section, which can often appear as desired. a prerequisite is that each appearance is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "if you want to send us a question about this product, simply complete all the fields marked * and click" "" "Send" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to show that a section starts (except for options) and request that the end of a crash is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map-file as e-mail to do I in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use can see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM command will be ignored (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to insert all the sounds that you need to play this instrument with the number M. if your keyboard support is not supported (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a rifle.</seg>
<seg id="1664">If a MIDI file is played with patch 127, it is patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant to be another permissible instrument (drums, pelvic, Maracas & etc;), and not the one, when the tone is the pitch of the same drum (like it some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section will be used to give as the sounds on a certain channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As at the PATCHMAP Section is the order of lines very important, as well as the pre-hand. you must also create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define for each channel and each instrument panel. you just need to use different names only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keys will be used above all, to create sounds on the perkite canal. check out as example the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form a number of channels. if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, you will make it easy in the CHANNELMAP Calendar.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion capabilities on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section, 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, set up following the pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">If you use the keywords name, which is defined on the channel N. if you use the keywords name for this channel, the respective keynote should be defined in the file: if you use the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored that the patch shall try to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">E-mail address for PayPal: info @ sheetmusicdb.net</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates the value of Pitch-Bender events in which ratio of Pitch-Bender events sends this value to the value of this formula (r / 4096). this value 4096 is returned to the Map (R / 4096).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM has a keyboard, which receives a Pitch-Bender event. unfortunately, but some keyboards to play a sound. unfortunately, there are some keyboards to play two tables to a octave. in order to try to try the right value to your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI interface, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this menu will find the menu settings, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). you see what sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list for each channel. if you have a instrument, the button won't be green but red to show that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">View the channel view (up to now) two different views to show the sounds sounds. view the menu settings below the menu channel: settings: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a sun. if you find such a song is too fast to follow the text, you may slow it. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anyone to do & kmid: but a typical MIDI file doesn't need about 50 KB, while a MIDI file doesn't need to change the individual instruments, speed, speed and etc. you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (counter, Deb) from & kmid: that happens because & kmid: without AWE support, you need to install a source distribution and install (e.g. kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supported & kmid; drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add to & Konqueror; and select all the files you want, and drag them on the & kmid; window.</seg>

<seg id="2026">An action can set up with settings actions... created. click the New promotion at the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This can be assigned to the keyboard shortcuts. by clicking the button the button can be selected; with Kone is the current keyboard shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailiated settings and in execution of the action, this text is added to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful shareholder. with the help of these action may change external applications (usually scripts, but it is not restricted) to change the document or use the document (or parts of the document).</seg>
<seg id="2030">You can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified quade is recommended, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir 'command line: $KDEDAY / share / free / quanta / free local scripts: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the URL of the current document, in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>

<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event is usually the filename of the current document or the path to project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods the script can be adjusted from & quantaplus on the default input. in the selection field input can be determined to send to the standard input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document will be sent to the script. the% variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">In accordance with the input, the output can be led to the output of the application. there are two types of issue: normal output, on the default output. it can be specified with the default output. it can be specified with the default output output.</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar to create a tool bar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar has been added, you need to add actions and configure settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this thread are quite self-explanatory. press the New promotion at the bottom end of the window in the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the right tool.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and if the tag attributes and you are planning to plan the" "" "day edit" "", "when available, so it is possible to insert a input under the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igam! is that an ugly symbol. who should notice the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action will better be better, we will use & kiconedit. choose from the & kmenu;, graphic other programs (or where otherwise it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select one another.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the symbol is not only helps you realize what the promotion does, but also in all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regards to that the day is called, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually less than los, stared, further interpreted), or should at least be able to add a message to the user.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creation of symbol tools, it must be connected to the promotion. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field, a button will press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is available, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button button and set it with other tags, so it's still available, or confirm with the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="2051">In addition, you want to complement some exercises and quantaplus; functions for the tool form or should be set for better overview through some Trenner in several groups. open the tool spot on the settings dialog. make sure that the desired workpiece is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the Trenner (left top right) for my tool bar. after selecting the element that should be added to the tool. this adds the item to the tool.</seg>
<seg id="2053">You can select the most suitable payment method: credit card, bank transfer, check, PayPal etc.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner is not able to support the group. someone who doesn't know my workpiece might be believe that & Konqueror; the contrary the start of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proxy to all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">In the right folder after the eXML is not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your tool bar should be loaded in the right folder. please do so that their workpiece is loaded (n) when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioned extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for script language or the formatting language you may like. therefore, this chapter describes how I have a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could start at & quantaplus and repository if someone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting and script / etc.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "if you want to change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g." "" "www / gallery /" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation of documentation. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "when you click the" "" "folder" "", "please note that you can easily change the Directory as well if you need to have your uploaded images placed in e.g." "" "www / gallery /" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before getting started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a subfolder in the tree with your content. there is no known border for the chess stream depth (except with reason) mdash: but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the contents can be found directly to a file system (and consequently it is indicated on the upper end of the construction mansion & mdash; folder).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Empty spaces are nothing but notice on & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; based & quantaplus; Resourcams are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The text section is the area of the docrc file, the context of the context of context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function returns the documentation directly. there is only two types of entries here: the context of the context (ContextList) and the file extensions.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate separate properties elements which should be available (for & PHP;, this are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and set in $HOME / .kde / share / eMail / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / category / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder on how to use this in your file docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. for the documentation you have been used to use & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development process.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, factory settings with actions, scripts, templates) with others.</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send e-mail to friends, partners or else who are sent. to different places there is a menu item entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantaplus can be downloaded here. the contributions will be checked and only available when our team will be checked as correct and usable for the publication. to ensure that the resources are assured, the origin of the resources are ensured both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload your Passphrase for your private GPG key (Passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you have multiple key words you have to look out. in the dialog box, the input fields must be empty (URL preview) and click on the bottom of the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP). download the menus and folders in the templates and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installing the installation and quantaplus, the integrity of the resource is given and it may be broken down. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message with the author of the text is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, currently not from & quantaplus. it is possible to work with an DTEP package, because hundreds of day files can be needed in day XML format. there are the simplest way to convert a DTD into an DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">This conversion can be created from the DTD format and conversions of a DTD, select the .dtd file containing the DTD details which shall be used. then the following dialog will appear in the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target: the newly created & DTEP will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / E / quanta / dtep Folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You will have to type in your hostname, if your site is not found, you will be asked if you want to save your project.</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantaplus; to conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand and full benefit from & quantaplus, this chapter has to be familiar with these fundamental concept without understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three sections: global, local and project management. this distinction is a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus is available, available as a global network, which is available as a global network, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus, which are available in a multi-user environment that are available in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of Webentwicklungsfirmen, which are user-specific patterns and workpieces. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available within a specific project. it can be said to be a specific project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all items are in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"" "the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the construction of the board, with information and the tool bar. please suggest that in and for further information on these areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the card with the right mouse button to obtain a contextual menu with the current document folders, such as complete, delete or reload the document, delete or upload the document to the current document or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-to-document (void / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste (paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste / paste on the mouse button in the editor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfensters, the tool bar can be shown at the top of the Editors. currently, the tool is now being shown as standard for which a set of workpiece is shown in the course of the further excavation of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2090">You can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider. an easy to use search interface in English,</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction of the project (QIT;) enable it to navigate through the information to & quantaplus, to navigate through the files, project, sample pattern, document structure, scripts and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that establishes all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by a right mouse click. actions such as Hindi, removing, upload, upload or delete files from the memory medium with the program editor.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole page & etc. there are all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be shared in three categories depending on which in which they are used. the category depends on the relevant user and templates in projects can be used only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script languages. the concept of the attached to Global, Lokal and project works here. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can open the available information about the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document indicates the cursor in document to the position of the element. through right click of an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and collecting the building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces change the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. it is possible to download the documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site, you can create your own documentation, and see how to add a folder on an project, it can be edited and edited.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two cards played at the bottom end of the window, through the use information can be achieved: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This paper investigates the impact of non-take-up for two hypothetical scenarios, namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by €100 per month. IAB-Discussion Paper 20 / 2015</seg>

<seg id="2102">The quantaplus holder: tool bar are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and get the relevant command. the chocolate bar ends the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a workpiece with Email. & quantaplus, sends the tool in an e-mail to send them into & quantaplus, as any other support and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus on your system. if autoconf is given a number of options that can be transferred to the control box. to get a complete list of all options, give you a complete list of all options, give you a complete list of options, which are easy to understand and click here.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached via the menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL. Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor operates as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML, -page and a cursor. then you edit and edit the source code editor which are visible in the source code in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">While working with the VPL, editor in a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol that is necessary to edit the Vohandensa from & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL. it is not possible to edit the source text editor. there is no plans to change this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL, editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in VPL; Editor synchron runs on this mode, the button allows the active cursor from a window to others, with the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Synchronisation spacing between the VPL, Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings to select from VPL; -View, you can automatically choose between synchronisation by one click or automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2220">It is assumed that you want to change the title of the website so is to choose document folders when working with the VPL; Editor is also called as soon as a new document containing the VPL. it is also used as a new document containing the VPL. it is used to change the suspension of the suspension.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags included the storage of information about the document, e.g. for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons, e.g. key words on the column names and keywords keyword key to the contents column.</seg>

<seg id="2225">The inserting tags is done in the same way via the tool bar, such as in source text editor, it is necessary to note that the inserting tags didn't remove the same identical tags, e.g. if a anchor day is removed with text, each other can be removed with text.</seg>

<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and related to the possibilities of present color monitors. if you are often cowhide, you'll may like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are visible below. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this on a view of the column in the column on the left side. (no trouble, if it doesn't change the insertion).</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in a line then shows the color to which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders you can find out the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">If you have any queries, please contact us if you are not logged in as a club member.</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows you to specify the file name from the set list, the selection of the file browser (file...) or select one of the last name from the set list. if you have to specify the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">If you select a folder, you can select a folder if you want to set a folder. if you select a folder, the password will be selected, for B and C but a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A to the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If the function is enabled, the input field is active and can edit the input field. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify a output rate.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The input button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before you start using the password / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only part of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use copy and write a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes it contains a file, e.g. several other features. if you want to figure out what these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would like to copy, paste, paste, paste, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can leave nothing from & kdiff3; not only the input of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret the numerals and paste text in another program as exporting and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such case you could go to your original data.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text line, the information line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional.) Jede Info line has a different color.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a colour blue, B, colour green and C is magenta. (this preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can be seen at the color which file differs from red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the colour scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">On the left side of the text, the column displays the corresponding colour. when differences in white characters, the color is not so important, it is useful to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters only exist in character and commentaries, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases).</seg>

<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several events at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' use to separate the meaning of each other:</seg>

<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file folder will be started, and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of type in the other folder is different, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane at the selected object. in such case the merge action can not automatically be selected. if the merge will be started, you will also be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Like in the above image, in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">The same applies to identical entries is the same as the same as the age of the entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their content is identical. then you also folder the same color. then you have the same color. at folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color is based on several diff. the colors reflect the colours of a leaf, which is green, then yellow is yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C is identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, deleting the target if there exists)</seg>

<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: together and the result in both folders. (the users see the visible file name for the output file only B; directly after the release, copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be assembled and the option of new file instead is activated, then the date of files and proposes the newer file, but the date is identical to the files are identical, but the date is identical.. Solange may not be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the meeting, a file after the other works. you have completed a status after the other. when the meeting was successfully completed, and according to others, if the meeting is completed, you should see a final review and see if the status is entered into order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the folder dialog the file distribution method is selected, KUL3 more columns is selected, the number of uncertainties, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for deleted conflict will only appear if three folders are compared to or assembled.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either redeem the just selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries are selected (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have no target folder, then use the three folder merge mode C as a goal, to synchronize the two and / or B as a goal.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you selected a target folder, check whether all entries will be shown in the folder structure. there are several options by the specific entries are displayed in the folder structure.</seg>
<seg id="2392">To select all entries, select controls and select F7 (the keyboard shortcut). select the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If applicable data types are still not yet invalid combination of actions, it appears to be a message to the faulty elements. you can choose a valid action.</seg>

<seg id="2396">When a manual intervention is necessary (together with a manual intervention is necessary (together a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start with a file, select again or press F7. if you have not saved a folder, then a corresponding dialog box will be displayed in a folder. then, then & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & kdiff3; there is a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the causes of the problem. you have the option to select a different action for the entry or the problem if you continue with the compilation.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually folded, noticed that & kdiff3; this entries have not been saved. even if you have not tested this entries, these entries will not be considered. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be assembled once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 users...) now has a section called directory memory with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the indicated patterns are shown in the element tree. split the pattern with a semicolon; a valid space holder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is to correspond with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders which correspond to that pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one pattern, use the semicolon; a valid space holder: '*' and '?'. default setting is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders which correspond to that pattern, are not displayed in the element tree. it can be used more than one pattern, use the semicolon; a valid space holder: '*' and '?'. default setting is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are ignored by CVS. many autmatically begot files are set by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder has to be set up with a .cvsignore file. (see below: / cvs / cvsignore).</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, a hidden attribute. a file is hidden. a file is hidden. a file is hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files appear in the element tree or not. this option is displayed in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links on files: when the option is switched off, symbolic link will be compared. if the option is switched on, the files are converted to the links. this is deactivated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic link will be displayed in the file. if the option is switched on, the links are treated like normal folders.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unavoids, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files that do not contain text.</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders to compare a slow network, it may be faster, only the change date and the file size. this speed offers a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is automatically activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentially the change date. there will be no real comparison instead. the files are considered as the same as they are equal. this can be useful when copying the change date. please use this option in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">To synchronize the synchronisation mode when two folders are specified and no target folder has been selected. in this mode the proposals will be the same as the file will be used in both folder. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying the copying of the newer file as an action. (this is not considered necessary for the knowledge that the other file does not change.) This option is off automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced by another file, the original version will be renamed and receives the original version. this is the normal merge file with the .original extension. this is also the normal context of individual files, not only the merge folder. this option is enabled in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folders are visible in the context of individual files; you can turn the window button by mouse button. if you don't want, you can switch the window size and text window to switch between the two views between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file just using double click. however, the file contains a corresponding menu item. if you want to save the file, the status will be added to the merge source and the file will not be used again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will be lost if you read the directory again: directory #: read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE support network quality with the help of kio slave slave. Kdiff3 uses this to read the files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders to open the local or remote machine.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one of an FTP server. the second command line generates a folder within a compressed archive system with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax of local files and folders. a few things should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">The path can be relatively easy. or if it is not possible, URLs are not possible, these are always absolutely absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">(# - &gt;% 23, empty label &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the names / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system, sometimes using the protocol, there is a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or a folder will be accepted. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, controls the permissions or change date from the original. (note: this is only possible at local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of the main purpose is currently being able to start the built-in-room viewer.

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band's band file using the band's tape using the tape recorder. you can create the index on two kinds of bands from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This allows a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings. you can create a backup profile for the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folders are automatically updated in which the backup will be automatically updated.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folders that are stored under backup files, which are stored on the same file system, that can be used on the same file system as the folder that can be used on other file systems, you can be separately ordered under backup files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files are changed since the last incrementationbackup option, a snap fixing file will be modified to have changed the files that have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used for the definition of changes since the last incineration use.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snap-in file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new flash file for the next backup will be created.</seg>

<seg id="2929">The settings can be configured via the menu item menu on the menu item menu. the following settings can be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device type (normally / dev / net). this path must also refer to the non-reactor version of the band unit.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If the band is active, transmitted & kdat, before the band is integrated into the drive. for some drives it is necessary before reading and write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is on, the option is switched off & kite; possibly it does not work with all the belt drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the integration of & kdat will be subject automatically. use this option to insert the floppy-Streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is on, try & dat, the hardware warnings to change the disk size for the band speed. no matter whether these setting is active or not, you need to be able to create a block size for your tape.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band format is formatted, writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only appear on the band. the content of the file is divided into:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band-ID. the format of this drawing is calculator: seconds, where you name the complete name of the system, the number of seconds, which has been passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure style archive that can be directly with & GNU; - tar. even other applications should work, as long as it doesn't exist.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& klog; is a & kde; - viewer for system prototyping. the program is intended for unauthorized users to obtain information about your system or where the system uses the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& klog log; helps users understand what your machine is in the background. the program is suitable for uncomfortable users that can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system files are deposited via your system.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystem log; experienced users with information about problems which may occur on their server. & ksystem log; therefore, some extended functions can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & klog log; a number of useful functions. includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the Syslog server and Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and are explained in other capitals of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen screenshot, & klog log; functions available, with their help you can filter the individual protocol type of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start is trying to open a system log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protokoll. the protocol files are usually displayed in Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for normal users, usually do not include any permission for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar to filter the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter by selecting the filter. then the protocol will only appear if in one of the columns in the columns defined by the filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry on this site. select the character set of the filter search by selecting the name of a process, and contribute to the name of a process, then shows you & ksystem log; all Protocol lines are sent to you by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with an increase of the protocol lines. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">You would like to show some specific process (e.g. in the system protokoll or in Cron Protocol), this can be useful when you book the output of a certain commands like e.g. for the start of the Samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the new lines in the context menu on the main menu to show all the new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub-folders. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu to open additional sub windows and select a protocol in the menu, select a protocol in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystem log; has an own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more information about the reference sources of & ksystem log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a couple of concepts and describes what you can with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init developed quickly to the standard for control of the program track in the flood of the system in the & Linux; so because it is easier to use powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not be interested in history of historical aspects (e.g., because I don't know about it, -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. This is therefore important because perhaps someone might try to connect a machine to System V Init, without a new installation and reformat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. see rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">If you need a script for each system service, you need to do a script for each system service which you wish to start at the high level of system or when changing on a other runlevel. system services include these things like setserial, which just started once started.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be part of / etc / rc.d if you need it. the most systems have this file, even if it is not much use for this file, even if it is not much use for this file. you can also use a rc.driver in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in various places according to the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default font is in / etc / initone. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the runlevel 3 is to change, then you can edit / etc / initdata of hand and change the 3. be very careful when you want to restart the system and then run it using the system:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how start it all the correct script? if you enter it -l in rc3.d, you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there is no right files. instead, every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory of init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">As starts and stops init actually, system services? quite easy: each of the script is written so that it is a argument like start and stop. you can start this script in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains the name, the script will stop the argument with the argument. when it comes to a S, the script will be called the argument with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. also, I could also have a user of Runlevel, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv. you should not be difficult because the program is so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simply not to say trifles: simply put one entry out of the available system services to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts between Runewin's position or position within one levels by making it elsewhere. this is only then if they draw one entry from the field of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you have to copy this in a new area. to copy it to a new Runlevel, you need to choose copying from the menu or to the target area -- even if the same entry has already exists in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a contract can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the Sortilasis of the surrounding items before you try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries which have been thrown into the recycle bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the taboo button to enable the various workflow system (able system services, runlevel 1 stop & etc.) and the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous version.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel. move it into the clipboard (you can use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a contract manually, press the button button to change the properties dialog box to accept the changes in order to accept changes to change the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu is a confirmation before they will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">If you would like to experiment with the standard Runewin and now start the machine. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / initdata and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be right).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc which are available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The kind of system services will be started in this distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary use of this distributions, but unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan a extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution: please check whether all configuration files are needed (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) will end up without sending messages when their configuration files not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to version, even from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send us information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is posted on & gt; 1.0. with this program, you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have done changes, you need to save this file. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool box or entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and user set list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards will only appear if you have advanced system settings. if you have to have advanced system settings, you can have a card card that you can create individual settings, if shadow passwords can be displayed in BSD (passwords, e.g. / etc / master.passwd) as in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a built-in file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recovers on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">This parameter can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups may be informed about group ownership of the user's group. the standard group, to the user, you can find in the field of Primur group. furthermore, users can mark the user in other groups of the field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialogue properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add images from the menu or group or click the appropriate button button. the Edit or delete the selected user and the selected group functions.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO File Manager, add the boot password, remove the time to the booting of the standard operating system that add the default system to remove, change operating systems, change operating systems, change, and more.</seg>
