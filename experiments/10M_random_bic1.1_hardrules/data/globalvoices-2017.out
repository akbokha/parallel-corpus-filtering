although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live for the first time .
and it was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films to American music , American music , and operated on American music .
indeed , this land had a deeper effect on me that I was mainly due to a American film journalist .
as 14 years I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Deep Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ ful rep@@ orter who played with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura @-@ Stu@@ der .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the absolute truth is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA was only increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you are always who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

much was written about the manifest@@ ations and the racism of this man .
the extraordinary aspect of his Ascension is for me as he is with his commitment .

the 13 million voices in which he won at the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dency was the highest number that was ever reached by the party with the candidate of the party .

who are the Americans who support this big@@ u@@ sic person , I asked me ?
I couldn &apos;t have Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers , not with the people who had learned to know during my time in Phoenix .
like for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist , the people from all over the world , a deep gl@@ amor@@ ous man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .

on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mainly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or maybe just because of his account , not @-@ white people .
the conflict with the idea that people have agreed to Tr@@ ump because they either take his racism and fan@@ ati@@ sm or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke out to me almost the heart .

the people of man said , one of my friends , is exactly that which has led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand people who act on another way and think .
it shows people that concerns and fears about the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities .
could it be that these weighing , of which most knows most knows for Tr@@ ump because they would like to gain control over a country , which they are disappointed ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?

however , one can barely forget the words of David Rem@@ inder that the cruel decision to raise a man to rise up to those who look forward to those who look different from them .

millions of people on all over the world appreciate the American Ideal - regardless of whether it or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background is always welcome , America is welcome every welcome .
for this land chose as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose history , how he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white American of this promise and says : to hell with their vers@@ atility , religious freedom and all the term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and her voices were loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could someone who is not so as you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a single and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan wrote with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God was thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that gets me my heart .

the music that is played at both places , not just the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ arb@@ age hill , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular with tourists , but worlds removed from nearby villages and its world famous kitchen .
for some years now the La banda de música ( music ban@@ de ) in the church : one of the children and adults of existing Symph@@ onie orchestra , which has found their musical instruments in an opportunity to overcome it with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students is devoted to the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca to the central interest .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is in one of the poor@@ est province of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs abuse and ban@@ anas @-@ violence .
however , this resulted in an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project , and the youth , as well as a rare author .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the right streets to go with their big passion .

more than 7@@ 0,000 km south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero plays the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the largest waste disposal of As@@ unci@@ ón .
music with reproduction instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under management of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez started to turn parts of the examination in instruments .

first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ sing , and we had to do with the same place in the same way , the children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before was seen : one made waste of waste .

&quot; &quot; &quot; photo © FIS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that is fighting the wild illegal fishing village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , originally written at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine about international , practice @-@ related solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ published in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
in West Africa , that this ship was operated in Li@@ beri@@ an waters of illegal fishing , before it had been sought after the other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eastern African countries were brought down to the question about the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war crimin@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply had everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; remember Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a conduc@@ tivity of the ken@@ o fish@@ eries officer . he is part of a team who discovered the ship itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2013 was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia due to lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , FIS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fisher@@ y ) ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fisher@@ y ) .
the members of this network are sold out in Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that were destroyed by their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are inter@@ twin@@ ed and working together . they exchange information from and stand up to each other , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ ging project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project offers FIS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing has a definition of definition : what will be caught , it is hidden because it is extremely difficult to make it extremely difficult because it is the illegal fishing port of regions .
by the obvious mis@@ understand@@ ings of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing environment may have a balance condition that are a del@@ ik@@ tive balance .
but while actions against the illegal fishing village , once the illegal fishing village has been influenced by bureau@@ cra@@ tic sei@@ zu@@ res , with the information between individual countries , the actions are in real @-@ time , with fol@@ g@@ able on FIS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there you can exchange the individual countries with each other for instance lists of existing licenses , news on suspected activities or details that you noticed during a harbour inf@@ ec@@ tion or experience .
fish @-@ i persec@@ uted the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if these are moving on the open sea , satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark the ships to fish in the bot@@ her@@ ical areas . however , susp@@ ects that a ship will discover its fallen fish in the way to other ships .
in the ide@@ al@@ case you can see such exam@@ inations that they have a fish fan@@ fare where they were and maybe even if they have a spot@@ ted .
countries , which are against illegal fishing , can be used on the basis of this information , which means that the ships can not sell their cargo . and that they can not sell their cargo from pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is a considerable financial loss for the owners , what means that the illegal fishing port is financi@@ ally not worth more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hubert Ber@@ gh , director Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and thereby also supports FIS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created in order to gain estimated 20 million dollars to lost sales , which penet@@ rate the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year , due to the illegal fisher@@ men who enter into ost@@ e@@ African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive @-@ fish @-@ fish companies , because of the region &apos;s commercial fisher@@ men from around the world .
such practices are among the events like the sailing under false flag , correc@@ tive licensing papers , speci@@ fying imagination of imagination , the fish @-@ protected species and fish in the nature of nature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale swal@@ low tries to close to FIS@@ H @-@ i .
so far , the closed front has been so far .
FIS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 exam@@ ining ships since its inc@@ eption .
criminal networks have been covered up in Tanzania . there were ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identity and found ships and found .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities to fight crime , FIS@@ H @-@ i information about illegal fishing on big distances and receive them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far in the networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system consisting of the FIS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships can also be precise .

the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , helps to hide the illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Michael Cop@@ eland , editor of Tr@@ y@@ gg and FIS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch to the example of their automatic identification systems where they are not supported by satellit@@ es .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information levels together . it is to help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
however , FIS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team Afri@@ cans have actually influence a global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ wards , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ ler has been working together with Google and the Marine Insp@@ ectors , Oce@@ ana , which offers satellite data , satellite data and by offering the position of each individual fol@@ dable ships worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; go to the neighb@@ ors to get a better picture of what it does - that is simply meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ ling their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ tered Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on a global system that per@@ missible from ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FIS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but they can also be deter@@ red .
ships that previously had without any licence and hardly any consequences they know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the FIS@@ H @-@ i @-@ countries have been a 33 % increase in fishing trips , since then fishing tackle more licenses .
after FIS@@ H @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 was launched , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors there on board tow@@ ing network , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of PE@@ H @-@ i Africa . photo courtesy of PE@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is strong that we will also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object in West Africa , several hundred million dollars by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries have closed , to so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model like FIS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures in other regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently I couldn &apos;t see FIS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most beautiful triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship , which was under false flag .
the ship was also present in bot@@ ene waters that are reserved for fisher@@ men in Somalia . &quot; with the integration of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong mark that they go against the illegal fishing spot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at FIS@@ H @-@ i , this is another successful success of many . at the same time the proof that such a collaborative work of the ocean is indeed a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . Emma Bry@@ ce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London .

there was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ff . during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a period of State &apos;s military service was his father from 1976 to 1978 .
Luis Gordon Qui@@ j@@ ano .
add to my press materials
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who is accused of de@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the removal of a 10 @-@ year child is charged .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had worked as a boy who had experienced as a boy , and who said before the court of his own father said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his story tells how great power is a parent , and how this child chose a way of salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father was started to take me to the military base , I often went to the hall of hall .
all the blessed him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father to him and some days later he showed me a black photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are a long hole , you have dropped you with one of the ERP system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why I don &apos;t want to save it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Est@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ ists to the Military Revolution@@ ary Army - the military arm of the Military Revolution@@ ary Workers Party .
for this reason it was for me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to the military base .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be in order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the prisoners are tor@@ tured by the prisoners .
my father took a total of four times after La Perla , everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to rise up . he led me to a bar@@ row , in the cars , furniture , furniture , TV , refrigerator cabinets .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blanket on a blanket , and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cavity on silver .
on this day I went to the other end of the bar , where the stolen items were set and signed me with a wax .
suddenly he showed an open room and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured by the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw and saw a sun , on the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they saw such as a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found that she was mounted on the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person that was straight there .
it is rarely a man with hand @-@ bed on the bed , covered him with water and hun@@ ted him a load of 220 VDC into the gen@@ it@@ als .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father was among the children of Israel , the same smell came from his room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I realized the smell again and it was clear to me that the smell of a body is in trouble .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that these men have killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he introduced me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were made with hand @-@ finger and were filled with ey@@ eli@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i , Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , one of civilians , who also participated in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses that bare naked men with the face of the bottom - all were filled with hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance to the entrance , quiet to the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father wanted to say to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are you this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he knew that these men were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were cast into a pit . they were killed and buried in a pit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I know this because my father told her at home .
apart from La Cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms , which were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man struck a man and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the former owner of the Zi@@ vi@@ ii Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also acc@@ redi@@ ted in La Perla @-@ Ri@@ bera process , which also was acc@@ redi@@ ted to R@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Ro@@ sia , the head of the memorial stone La Perla , through the former fol@@ cl@@ esi@@ ons chambers .
the path , on which you come here , is also the path that came here .
if you look at the card , see that they took about this path and then took to the first time .
here their names were changed and they came as part of the process of human human thinking .
when they lived by torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came to be moved .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the destruction of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
July August September October November December
my father brought all the possible things together with home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was in the military , I was in the G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie , I was clear that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military marks that one takes up one enemy who is fighting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who want the cars on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is there a crime ?
he explo@@ ded me before anger , struck me and cried :
if you do so far , I will find you and bring your own hands .
but we need no one else !
so my father was my father .
I have no good remin@@ der to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that , on which I had a jacket and a rolling wooden pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Perla .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor but he spent clothes with home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , the defence took me to be a co @-@ ordin@@ ator of this crime . I did not contradi@@ ct my problem , they can take me to load what they wanted .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have done so during the dictatorship of people . but what the body can disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why children do not lead ?
one day after my father had been a girl with home his mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this is a small girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always put the question : they were persec@@ uted , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these words are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I made him notice because of all of the Gr@@ aus@@ am@@ ite that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know not . I have killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt lon@@ ze@@ able , and asked me to explain what the most clearly in@@ significant patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who def@@ ended them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you say to me ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you have killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older auto@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but maybe but also with b@@ ös@@ ke h@@ ors &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ ented Auto@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input field and in the building itself .
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investigation ( TV )
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ri@@ al . he was also atten@@ tive to the local newspapers .
the Ky@@ oto @-@ daily Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such a English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
this is a reward for older people and in an international city such as Ky@@ oto simply in@@ acceptable , &quot; said Mr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun Race &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scott Race &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate vehicle when the programme is not completely correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fields drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto was ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already mentioned in the text that they had been checked from the transl@@ ators and that the translation was not checked on their accuracy before they were published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are no Belgi@@ ans to speak of - just the three peoples of Belgium agre@@ eing that they don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really sorry that older people by the in@@ adequate correction ( translation ) in our part , said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese magazine J @-@ Cast News offers something detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was released as an adequate description of older auto@@ driver . according to the police , the proportion of the police have been involved in accidents , but they do not mean a concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Ky@@ oto , for example , in 2005 1,9@@ 41 from a total of 19.@@ 460 amounts of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors of 1,@@ 803 of 11.@@ 850 accidents .

- Is it ( &quot; sc@@ ented Auto@@ drivers &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How does the translation is actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real translation is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is not a few such comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why does En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is so widespread in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation missions are manifold .
to transfer , you need two important skills : passive voice in order to understand and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
this latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is in native languages . generally , the conviction that transl@@ ates in the target language is not in the initial language - native language .
a French native language should be translated from French to French - not from French to English .

many Japanese companies employ no employees with English as a native language , the translations into English language . this may be the understanding of understanding , cost reasons or relatively small number of English native speakers to study Japanese .
some companies that even have no foreign employees , translations are still fir@@ med . then the Japanese employees , whose English employees are made in English , the Japanese employees , whose English language skills are really good or bad .

machine translation is also widespread - often with fun results .
the wor@@ ries and r@@ hy@@ m@@ ous sentences that are to replace through machine translation by machine translation . this is true for some languages , especially for some languages .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the r@@ hy@@ per @-@ shirts , which often uses T @-@ shirts or pockets will be used only to be read or understood .

translation errors like jewellery are acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . but of large businesses or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards .
the city of Ky@@ oto use the future hopefully a serial source for their translations .

shortly before her studies at the University she returned once again into the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; die &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was treated in this house never as a daughter .
when she was ten years old , she started to work as Cri@@ k@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one of Paraguay has been forced to work in the more than 46@@ .000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the business is quite easy : a great family with little money over their min@@ ed @-@ year @-@ old son or her min@@ ed daughter to another , the family . in thousands he receives the child food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mentioned , the children have to afford countless days of household work , which can never be paid and victim of abuse and mis@@ er@@ ings , and all that can be unable to lift it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely distributed in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organizations .
after completing her study , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked several years for an organization that fought for the rights of the boys and girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; resear@@ ched and pran@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they tried to call things to name , as the feeling of gra@@ titude , which is the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , is guaranteed in general .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double t@@ inc@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one of the family to close their daughter in faith that they continue to enhance their position in society , and &quot; something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make something from themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand there is the family that takes the girl with himself and whose exploitation is justified by faith that she would have to give someone to someone who would otherwise no education and perhaps even be hungry .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mis@@ er , his family will have only many years later .

in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ ough in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ min@@ ta in the household of the former military , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants and 250 kilometres east of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín , until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment of the young girl .
a few days later , the media about the incident .
Originaltitel : the Young and the Rest@@ less ( TV )
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela took part in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ sic society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called upon that there is no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without the paper , it is much easier to harm the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the Eh@@ ep@@ a@@ ars and nearly 60 civil society organizations required a little investigation of the Falls .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who led her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , about 30 years of prison .
if the case before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be consec@@ rated - if the first time in history of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go has come from the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the daily life of a Cri@@ k@@ ta
the Cri@@ min@@ tas won &apos;t only be exploited as a working forces , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ming , where her father worked , he had to register later and her father lost his work .
her brothers had to work all work and began on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to sell money .
they went to school , but they went to school .
only Tina was sent to As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived between four and six hours every day .
the time had to share the time so that you still had time to learning .
they stood every morning against five o &apos;clock , and prepared the breakfast for their employers .

when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learning .
the more they had finished , the more time had it .
but this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to be hungry , but also not an unlimited food . &quot; I left me more books from the library of the house@@ wife to take a meal from the fridge , &quot; rec@@ alls her .
the library was well appointed and belonged to the house@@ wife liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the dictatorship of the dictatorship of the dictatorship of the dictatorship of the opposition .
in some evenings , the hosts Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , along with him and to read the articles from Op@@ posi@@ tions@@ .com , such as &quot; transmitter o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to convince them to present the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intellig@@ ently , but not with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper didn &apos;t found someone who spoke about politics , &quot; says them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would have to be &quot; bad habit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a who would speak to the indi@@ rectly group of Guar@@ an@@ í would speak to her native language of Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her Lord feared that they had the education that they had to lose her , she explained them .

in the school of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated , &quot; a thing about which almost never talked about , are har@@ med and the che@@ ologists who cri@@ es Cri@@ adi@@ tas as they are to school .
because the other children have their parents , they realize that someone who has no parents , a Cri@@ min@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t buy anyone anything at home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I feel particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the groove of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that a penalty of up to six months , or an account of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the draft , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ms , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running about the Internet and communicate with other means to communicate with other means of voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear that the draft will not be assumed by the draft , as the draft shall not be resur@@ rec@@ ted as the Egyptian authorities have not been able to sign up , as those of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure that Egyptian government is currently working on the level of social media companies .

this could mean that Egypt is planning to be a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those that would be required for the Egyp@@ tians , the Egyp@@ tians would be required to access their identity to the network .

the German Minister for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) , on German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I am strong on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have done with technology .
in my opinion , they make it so that just as they are violent physical public and private rooms , they could also be done online .
when I take it seriously , it means that it is possible to filter a powerful monitoring system to monitor citizens or not . and this means an abandoned system to monitor the activities of people and also , they also supply a trial process .
that is technically not realistic - but in Egypt , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted by the law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative framework of Parliament and the Constitutional Treaty before it &apos;s going to plen@@ ary the plen@@ ary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why is this certain kind of Leop@@ ar@@ den so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video shows , &quot; the Per@@ sian Leop@@ ard shows the only remaining prey in the itali@@ an ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the top of the ecos@@ ystems that there is a big prey .
the chance to see a Per@@ sian Leop@@ ar@@ den in fact is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video it shows that they have a good cat in the camera that lets the recording of a big cat in the camera .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triple disaster , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ äl@@ zer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ agi , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such tension .
for nearly 40 % of the year of ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster was more successful than 75 percent of ev@@ ac@@ uation which are over@@ hau@@ led after the disaster in heating systems .
the costs of paid items are shown in the procedure , a paid listing has to be confirmed explic@@ itely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyday life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the most important part of our everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung could be opened , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , its p@@ for@@ ts until December 2016 , which is almost 98 percent of schools of the three embos@@ sing cultures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three embos@@ sing activity .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi are again in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima was only 30 per cent of fishing ports in its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident , have gone in the three embos@@ sing activity of agricultural land in co @-@ passionate .
Mi@@ y@@ agi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 % destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atom@@ ic nucle@@ us , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares , was destroyed by 5 400 hectares , in the &quot; nuclear war of Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is two years ago when the activities were placed in sugar cane factories .

the reduction of sugar pi@@ pel@@ ines was a economic necessity for 155 sugar pipe factories were technically fe@@ a@@ sible , and hardly competitive they were not competitive enough for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient industry , the annual production goals was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the crisis of the world market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the sugar price was over approximately a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar is between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to 2016 published &quot; agricultural activists &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production will reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export was about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day comes with safety in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first words of the k@@ ub@@ an president of Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then the process of restructuring in the sugar industry started in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the down@@ ward of a total of 98 sugar pipe factories , more than 65 million persons received their full commitment to training .
the same thing happened at the sugar cane of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in 1967 in the factory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is the word that he says in most repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he was against his will at the down@@ ward of the factory which he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with each part that he has stopped , he dis@@ sent one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area was deleted by Cuba and the most important work sp@@ lat@@ ors .
in many cases , no alternatives for work stations and services which generated installations in the congregations are generated in which they found themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the dam@@ ned president in the eyes of the present persons , as he guaranteed that for the opponents , their factories has been no longer in operation , everything was good . &quot; &quot; &quot;

frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( single @-@ section ) which allows them to draw up . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence of Christians with Muslims or in defense of the Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second question@@ ing uses the picture to discuss how a African life in comparison to a European or French life .
religion means to understand and the value of human life is essential for both . therefore it is worth@@ while to examine how images in connection with these efforts are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens when reading these images do not be able to offer longer faith . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with social media there are many people who have un@@ intended to claim the water around a tragedy .
however , this mood of wrong and false information is that actual off@@ ert@@ ory did un@@ true , and whi@@ ch@@ ever the real eye of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a argument is that the rej@@ ection of images of a consec@@ ration is equ@@ alled to recognize the tragedy of the tragedy . at times , these pictures are even demands of the victims itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and spectators des@@ ensi@@ tise them to feel the ability to feel recep@@ tive ( so for example , for example those that can help others to help others ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of violent messages in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this word .
this unique words was collected in a online list .
most of these lists have Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ is from &quot; Un@@ transl@@ ating &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you will find the words from the Swiss @-@ Language language of Van@@ u@@ atu , as :

we repeat our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ que : due to corruption , the head of the President of the prison for the prison sentence of the prison sentence .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que beha@@ ved with anger on a cor@@ rup@@ tive case with a government member after half of his arrest con@@ spiracy at the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed .
in this respect , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , the 2008 arrested and arrested four other def@@ endants filed with the four other def@@ endants of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
this money is from public transport to the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and demanded immediately his re@@ taining to the company , which on 19 April then came .
in accordance with the statement of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic , there would not be an obstac@@ le for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer to his old post , since the company &apos;s not a foundation upon his trial .
however , many residents of the action are not good .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , just CIP ) , an local institution providing for public transparency , is condem@@ ned to an interview with the German wave the decision of the company to introduce the Director :
a return to corruption in the fight against corruption and is the lack of transparency and is even a return step in terms of our legal system , as the CIP system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of this is that the company would have to enter a disciplines against immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company was silent , however , no provision of appropriate legal proceedings for the application of the respective functions .
- Gain an outlook of the historic development , current market situation , and future outlook of the agricultural and forestry tractor market in Belgium to 2019 - Market Size , Development , and Forecasts
if Cam@@ ba@@ za is a competent type , he would be convi@@ cted after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and of which the half did not eat half .
he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches , he could advise and his image .
but as it is in@@ competent , it has all necessary to be integrated into the company who helped damage to damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is paid for his silence .
be careful !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ quit@@ ous and student of political science in Brazil , the director has no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za from the state is re@@ warded , because it is re@@ warded to it , I cannot believe that someone has been re@@ warded to such a way that the state has already gone .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he had already given a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it is operated on the state .

the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they have brought the use of the word or doubt that they have brought to the use of the word .
there are several small words with many different mean@@ ings that have the same character pages as &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters as also other words like &apos; kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ine ) , &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
at the same time , there was a number of mean@@ ings of words from the words of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .

I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I ru@@ ined me just at home , when suddenly , Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ ai@@ da Lodge ) . he had a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river one Leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father had observed it and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to get pictures .
Sag@@ ar aims to gain cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ als and wants to deep@@ en understanding the understanding of the wild animals not such as they look like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know it , for he stood in the face of the face of face , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in order to promote wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for use &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ as nature and wild , however , is not always easy .
he was waiting for 22 days long , and lived in a tent in order to take up to 12 days until he was photograph@@ ed up to 12 days until he could take a tiger photo and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .

this post was published by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally posted on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation of India .
a revised version was published here as a part of an content sharing agreement .
in many parts they avoid women with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands , or even from older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a p@@ onom@@ y or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father &apos;s child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect their hus@@ bands , as well as fear of the consequences they should be ab@@ sent to life this practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian state of Rome , and sentenced to her family and the village community , after they had a secret relationship with names .
the tradition of their wives are also common to name , even under men . however , they have much less conc@@ es@@ sions , if ever , they should not come out of this practice .
in the small village of the Pun@@ e in the Pun@@ e , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among others , including health care and home .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , in 13 Indian countries , he is part of the campaign # K@@ helmet Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , and set himself for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ń@@ ski has been working for seven years with help of their video camera on the notice of practices , such as children &apos;s home and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs .
they reported about how these clubs have created a secure place for these women , and they have made them at the same time to bot@@ an@@ ed inside the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , was made by women who did not call their hus@@ bands .
it has decided for this subject because it wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify women .
the names of their hus@@ bands are not according to the names of their hus@@ bands , is a bre@@ ach that they keep guilty and never met in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good idea . &quot; &quot;
this tradition has been witn@@ essing that a woman wants her husband to respect and wishes a long life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t stop it as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted in our discussion round up to this discussion round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called the name of her husband , to try at home as it runs at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round at her husband and her mother @-@ law .

many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor never before . some believed that there was a good cause because it meant that the younger members of a family , mainly girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of feelings about their hus@@ bands with various feelings - happy , s@@ laugh@@ ed , sad , lov@@ ingly , and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When we can &apos;t tell us the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t even be uniform ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married and this was the first day in which they brought to the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .

the other women are not fully aware of this , but my they are now in a better position , even to bear it in some days .
many women is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with every occasion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we have lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make women who can listen to women , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own bir@@ th@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and san@@ iti@@ zed and red@@ ded things , about which they had never made thought .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems and yet I also have about some things , for example as our identity to our husband are not so honest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it feels great to say certain things according to you , quite a matter how small it is .
in a discussion round , we have to talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .

next you will have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can be worn and raw , is sure that they will get rid of it .

now only small steps are made .
some women tried to say some time , but they listened to the name of their hus@@ bands .

only one or two will continue to continue the name of their hus@@ bands , only one or two women carry up on Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ ead .

Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be foo@@ lish , Singapore &apos;s international level as an independent state .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate .
during the meeting on a meeting of the International Business Association of the State of New York , the ministers agreed that many people took the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore based in Singapore with other countries .
he supp@@ or@@ tive that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has to ask whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people have a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Ministry of Justice , &quot; to defend the logic of the power of power in Singapore .
and then after all of our efforts and efforts to create this valuable country , one would say that we would not be a country .
it happened so vul@@ g@@ ated , it had the accus@@ ation of a flight in front of the responsibilities , a mandatory prosec@@ utor .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , it is then ?
the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore did not measure the political system from Singapore .
however , he has def@@ ended the idea that Singapore with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , the cities that are permanently guided by a party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these cities are democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once you reached the core center of the them@@ as , the good old Lei@@ er from the authorit@@ arian Mach@@ th@@ ab@@ ern , who left the only demo@@ cr@@ ats , left the logic of the logic , as it adap@@ ts better to their power .

if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to what country belongs to what country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our standard K sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would be able to clarify this point , if he was paid in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore is so important , even if we are free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities were ten years of a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when He said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it not in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am over what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader in Singapore , I am doubt and I am not sure whether he is really aware of what he def@@ ends .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credi@@ ted a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was a fre@@ ud@@ al institution ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question which is given me in Japan is saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , do you evil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation , the conversation is taking place , it is regarded as poli@@ te , interest to its singing , by making personal questions .
on my order , then the standard response : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Kan@@ adi@@ er cook perhaps internal and if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t distur@@ b it .
for somebody who doesn &apos;t know , there are little that different from the American guns .
this is one of the reasons why so many Kan@@ adi@@ er takes a Canadian pot in her back@@ pack when they travel .
all love can@@ adi@@ er .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
so it was already , when I began 20 years ago , the world began to travel - before Donald Tr@@ ump in front of Iraq and before the 11th of September .
Can@@ adi@@ er always have small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighb@@ ors .

we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are obviously very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also an toler@@ ant country compared to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types in the south of the border .
from the last 100 days
I h@@ asse that .
first I have lots of American friends , which I admi@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; means to be called &quot; nice &quot; means it is basically to be a necessity , but tragic , but tragic figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a own Canadian double taxation ) .
if Canada really really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; is not a personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing of which one can escape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing is harm@@ less and un@@ interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , from the things that around one around .
I would even go to say that the desire to be freely and alone , a main one of the Kan@@ adi@@ er .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what outdoor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply called cool Hö@@ f@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he doesn &apos;t talk about the fence sitting with the neighb@@ ors .
it is also a warm , open friend@@ liness , which I get together with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ ste@@ er will be the stage to show that Kan@@ adi@@ er more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister , Canada is almost perfect .
Musik@@ video von Pop @-@ Band Par@@ odi@@ l Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta Par@@ odi@@ ert , which 2014 the power and despite their promises to the civil government , the country still reign@@ ed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a young man who tells of which he tells him his girl@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly politically , the musical video refers to the continued military force of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was written by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
in the last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; is blo@@ cked after a group of activists to take the public to see this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics as well as the location of the country under the Jun@@ ta domin@@ ion .
take a look at the videos on some of the political themes , Thailand in the past three years have been pursued .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girl &quot; may appear on the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provis@@ ional Constitution , which means the upper limit of the absolute decision making over important national issues .
11 . rule : &quot; change your setting &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of journalists , students , scientists , politicians , politicians , politicians and other people who are considered to be a cri@@ tic of the Jun@@ ta as a cri@@ tic .
the picture shows the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear provisions are often used by the authorities to restri@@ ct and other critics of the State .

on 20 May 2014 , in Thailand the war has been approved in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to buy , however , their decision to buy expensive U boats and security experts they war@@ med that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax burden .
in the video it is even shown as individuals in a black delivery flight , before they bring it into a interval camp , another problem .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits with a smile as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to get her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America .
the family had a famous name on the track , &quot; M@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he told that Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often come together the track and that Afri@@ cans already speak to the Pope Ram@@ í@@ rez talk .
like many of his compan@@ ions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and has worked as a construction workers in the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
as the Brazilian economy , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ um Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus back to Ti@@ anes .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez Contact .
&quot; mother Africa is our mother and we never go back . &quot; we are always in contact . &quot; we are always in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that her guests can send a lot of text if they have lost or to report her through the course of her journey .
they explained that their Christian faith is the power of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought them to prepare h@@ ey like in Ghana .

they sent me and my father 3 times , but that was not enough to have &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of security advis@@ ing it to us - with the promises that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he turned his power over us , by focusing even the simpl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were killed during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city of the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
all town districts are sought after , only my own not .
for the first time it was still quiet , at the right time , even if I had no high claims to a city , which is set up to the ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security @-@ organisms and their complications .
in the third night the things had a bit so@@ othing after the power supply within the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by making several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice in the silence of silence .
a few minutes later felt some of my friends mu@@ tig enough to tie together .
I was not alone .
dear friends , true friends turned to me ; we forgot to a pra@@ ying picture that my expectations filled with full and fully fulfilled .
such a moment will be aware of you that you have fre@@ ed the mind from the lamp , but I don &apos;t interested you in Ger@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how many honey do hin@@ ders you - nothing can give you your voice , after you have done all the way to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I came there there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the upper Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you hear &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes made me on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re sad about what to look at me and not on the floor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; maybe at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I never heard you in the sight , so why should I do it ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t have a word of what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in individual and his father is equal to his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was sentenced to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spiritual judge , which I had exposed to monthly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I sh@@ orten the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I want with me .
then again through the farm and in the second office , which leads through a course to individual cells .

I have to share it with only one another prisoners and can put me immediately without waiting for the permission .
after a couple of minutes , who felt like a whole life , left the cell , and I handle on a wide spectrum of communication method : to beat the wall against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a very good example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after years of co@@ hes@@ ion he answered me .
and in no one of the surrounding cells were a prestigious man of middle age , which is similar to me and the doctor .
in the perfect darkness there is no distinctive facial expressions , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone &apos;s voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would like to know a bird of a bird in order to remove all these forces to remove the fruits in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I heard it still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has to be about 10 PM in the evening ; always in the evening the schri@@ lling , every day .
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always convinced that black the color of the life is , until I saw the yellow light that made us the Gr@@ auen in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; arrival at 13 S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to listen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret : to protect the State Security Council to protect us and prevent the terrorists in our al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - and thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al tile map and bol@@ ted the narrow view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land ; it is a curse that call it to co @-@ existence in order to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound in a hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expressions that ent@@ ails him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin with your life when you start to join these diary , and on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t answered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really do not really want to say what Bel@@ kin and Schl@@ ager have become an important conversation for me to an ordinary communication means .
when and how the happens was , it was imper@@ ative .
any voice in me said that I had to say well , that I had to be pun@@ ished , although I had nothing done to earn it .
a penalty in all of their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .

it starts with a plastic tube , which is probably from the monastery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t judge you with him and you can &apos;t hold your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my first arrest , I asked if the revision@@ ists had worked as a waste stream or whether that belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables together in order to present us out of their view , great invention of a huge cable .
in a single hour , three of them came from them , while I still was still in the row .
I had any time feeling in my body , and also my voice , why I heard my heard .

the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper La@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b rough a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b complet@@ es the majority of his time , when he comes to his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch .
what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers and his ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
he lives in the chief business of his family house , which was born in 1967 to fle@@ e their occupation of the West Bank , and was forced to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine , in which they lived in Palestine ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activity , who asks the conservative decision and asks its proven opinion about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and Rap@@ music .
with his music , which often sets with topics such as Orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of the Arab world . all these subjects will not only find out in his home town Am@@ man , but also in cities which by Damascus in Syria , according to San@@ aa .
with its 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b as someone who is not limited in his mind , and he can feel the off@@ ence with people who feel the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Syria and Libya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he doesn &apos;t open it , he told him that the American foreign policy is not open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , ir@@ rational what caused by his identity as &quot; Palestinian ro@@ aming of the second generation &quot; - so he was born in Jordan and still had never been born in Jordan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life distances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he added : &quot; I think that I am a person , &quot; while he had a man , while he shake the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is scheduled for Muslims to come from sunrise until sunset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the j@@ ord@@ an law also implies that the public debt of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an illegal is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has some weakness to break with an ancient traditions : on the other hand , a cup of coffee was little to do with protest against Islam .
in principle , the mud cigarette and the fridge is in the first line of liber@@ ty in the nose with the first line of freedom .
sometimes the Jordan did not feel a prison under the open heavens , especially if you have a look into the neighbor@@ ing countries .
hence it is easy to do basic things - like in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Ministry launched a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already in the second time .
some parliamentary elections to support the Islamic fundament@@ als - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslims , that the sexual orientation of the Fron@@ tier@@ ra Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country , says the main reason for the concert table .
the MEP and former press spokesman for the Islamic Coalition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ pen@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was saying in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was saying in a interview with CN@@ N that the concert has been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world of dangerous beliefs , which represents the well @-@ proven Leg@@ i@@ tim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a the j@@ ord@@ an the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is not easy to be sil@@ enced Rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a more clearly visible reality in Jordan joins that in h@@ da@@ i@@ bs work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional sex stories to Lei@@ be , by creating his vision of the fate of Arabic women who made the first sex sex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a obviously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unknown woman , whose arms and legs up to the corners of the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through hands of those who are actually trust .
during the past few years , Jordan did the number of &apos; Honor@@ mor@@ de &apos; - the official outside .
human Rights Watch therefore stood by the number of the mor@@ als in 2016 , however , the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women who tried to support the victims of victims or violence in favour of adequate way .
according to a law to compens@@ ate violence from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the threat of family violence , &quot; and for their release , is often a years of bureau@@ cra@@ tic effort as well as the guarantee of the family that woman will not happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b spread that his work is politically , yet , however , that he is his music that is full of explicit rej@@ ection of sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not of politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gh@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are on the core is running .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b has published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get , &quot; that can be &quot; - be faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ geneous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that barely any man speaks to Jordan about the rights of sw@@ ings and reading , and that comments for equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been strongly weak@@ ened in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Internet program Ro@@ ya to notice that his comments from the context was torn , rot@@ ates and his opinion were mark@@ eted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment it was un@@ loaded , it was un@@ loaded , but only one worked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly acknowledged for the Arab H@@ BT@@ Q + community and performs the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als are not anti @-@ Islam .
he mentioned Abu &apos;s , a poet of the nin@@ ete@@ enth century , which is still in the same today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ i could work on the order of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the view of the pot@@ assi@@ um , why can Jordan did not leave Jordan ?
the actual problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government attacks on free expression of expression , and that progressive voices are brought to silence .
even recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an agreement has received several former foreign ministers and members of the teachers , with the reason why they had voted against the problems in social media and the problems associated with the deep in the land ru@@ bb@@ ish corruption .
in the face of what is the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , it is only the tip of the Eis@@ berg - the real challenge is to interpre@@ t a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
in Jordan , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a now hon@@ oured the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so far it &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and internal changes . it is sure that these changes of day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society will take place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Ara@@ bs , including a Arab world without inter@@ ven@@ tions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed not only that his work up to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
maybe the region with music , art and literature are a true and fundamental principles - and not by Bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and the artificial kind of Tibetan democra@@ cies . at least he hopes it .
as far as it is , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue straight and therefore resist@@ ed resistance .

there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ula Festivals .
another theory is that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which was accompanied by a very few years later , and from a time , in the armies of Jap@@ h@@ um , in the north @-@ east , in order to force the indigenous population of the region who participated in K@@ nie to force the K@@ nie .

why are we only love to people who know ?
is it not much more important to bring people who want to bring out their aff@@ ection ?
this question was about the two young colonial activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young European Youth Foundation , and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as de la Rec@@ on@@ ados .
only before dum@@ b the land of a historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of long negotiations , the col@@ loqui@@ al government had closed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ atory FAR@@ C ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treaty of the Peace Treaty will be so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Antonio was received by his advoc@@ ate for peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the column , however , there is a long way to talk about the true reconciliation and peace of peace .

the Colom@@ bian society again , who had been re@@ conc@@ iled to life in general fear and in some cases in some cases deep hatred of Guer@@ ill@@ aris , must now record them in their ranks , and to support them in the structure of a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cris@@ tian got convinced that the young column will close together and have to help the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly that they did , until now , there are thousands of young people letters - lov@@ akia at former guer@@ ri@@ lla struggles to welcome them again in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ llas - that will be delivered personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as a inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was built on the World Summit of Peace Prize who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ ben@@ th@@ i , 2014 to the Peace Prize for Peace Prize .
this declared that we love the people we love to love at Valentine &apos;s Day .
he told him that he told him that this year he was able to share his love with people that &apos;s most urgent need .
thus the plan was to write letters of hope and support of the FAR@@ C to write their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ sem@@ ination of a history of peace , &quot; say they .
so far , the campaign was more than 2000 letters in the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters .

the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN @-@ camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students at the University of Al@@ kal@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art rei@@ sts in the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the FAR@@ C joined the FAR@@ C &apos;s members , as they had done earlier in order to counter@@ act the commands of their guide .
but this time they were no commands , but letters of full under@@ taking of people out of the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience as :
after having passed the letters , a former intelligence led by the camp of Guer@@ illa comb@@ at@@ ants .
when I was in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of refuge in which the Guer@@ ill@@ ators are living ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ cane who wrote something .
I had fear that , as next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ rö@@ sh@@ ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has never been written in my life , so answer me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I sle@@ pt the tears over the tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

perhaps he was in the war , it was sorry , all the years of the tre@@ aties he would help to write this letter , and would help him to write this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never heard something else from life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAR@@ C was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never thought that someone would be for my mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now I know that there is a company that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where there is peace , I can learn many things and dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the year , students and some lawyers of the FAR@@ C came to a discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were grown up as already war , and the FAR@@ C already had already had the secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the FAR@@ C &apos;s history of the FAR@@ C is the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop the social injus@@ tice of the state . now , where we have the possibility to design us to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth it to overcome all obstacles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those people who have never found obe@@ dience , and even think that people who are often seen as Monster are often seen as Monster , even only people with beautiful feelings are revers@@ ed by their habit@@ ations and their environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reality , in which the land lives , is mine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it came to me that all men - even those who killed and so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of former comb@@ at@@ ants killed on the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , including the Arch@@ bishop of Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column was made clear that according to the dis@@ arm@@ aments of peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , it will always give people who are willing to attack their weapons and to fight for their rights . and this is also totally justified ( ... ) .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
therefore we call all the defence of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology , they belong to all those who wish to dream about a country in war .
we give you our word , to help our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know of own experience that nothing is simple . for those who defend the lives as the foundation of existence , many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles but together we will overcome them .

Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer director in a human rights organisation .
one day was told to me that someone took my help .
it was a friend of D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ wife that is in trouble .
she had no money , so he took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he would be a friend to find a copy of my documents and summar@@ ise them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me .

&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was straight to pick a few shopping from my cars , I heard a male voice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How long do you want to eat the family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How long do you want to honor the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the hospital , I knew that I had to overcome two reasons in my right lung wings .
OC Media : what do you have to do - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , it is still my male name ; but the doctor stood up , and laid me to the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I got his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ tic , a k@@ au@@ ra name .
but he turned out as good man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him that he has gone up with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than one month at the hospital .
I was able to live with them .
it took me to me , tell me - , stran@@ gers , some completely un@@ known .
it was the start of a mountain@@ ous .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some remote relatives .

they ordered the absurd recei@@ v@@ ables : some said to me , I think it is in the official television in Gros@@ ny and tell that I had not changed my sex , and I have not changed my sex .
you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or track@@ back .
OC Media : how does your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke to my mother at the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a Monster to the world , that not only your family but the entire republic has damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot be exhau@@ sted because you are a happy woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and they laid a Stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change several times a day .
I moved to a flat , and already a few hours later , under the window a car with dark windows and a num@@ eric sign with a 95 release .

for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their name , but I will say that I will be reminded to them , they have helped me .
with their help , I left the land , but then sometimes somewhat im@@ planted .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother , as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without pre @-@ register , without registration without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and put it in the effort .
came into and check@@ ered into the hotel .
the number was to be registered .
click &apos; Insert Before &apos; button and &apos; Publish button &apos; .
in the moment when I asked my mother to comment , I got a message : &quot; you believe not about you , you war@@ n in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you want . you know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family still in contact ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the course of the inter@@ course , we do not talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two traditionally c@@ aff@@ eine elements I still have in me still in me .
so much I wish to send this pastoral barrier . I am not able to overcome this pastoral barrier .
I say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to harm them .
if we want to chat with camera , I don &apos;t want to look like the person who reminded me of her past - so on my male &apos;s form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do you do for those who have stayed in the years ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report in Washington .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with someone who has spent a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had no human being arrested and persec@@ uted , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an were not waiting for the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an , and he got a new wave .
it is probably the most likely to concentrate on family and destruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means I will probably take the relationship to the problem with the affected person and at the end of a proof that the so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : will now also s@@ acks up men in this secret meeting ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be brought out , you will show their bodies in the television , and claim they had attacked a village or a military supporting point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these men have not simply disappeared , but to radi@@ ate radical and radical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is now only a matter or have you an source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just like someone who had a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared into this prison after having grown up .
since then , there were nothing new ways of them .
they have taken it easy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even able to hear as those people were taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now they were not presented as ban@@ di@@ ers , there were still no reports . we assume that such actions are actually possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why otherwise one should not allowed these men to lose itself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
know whether these persec@@ utions and dis@@ appear@@ ances of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation in the past ?

the following article is a revised version of the statement that was published by Ay@@ om@@ id Zur@@ i and originally posted on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the object of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comment@@ aries below the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as intercultural femin@@ ism - with Fr@@ inge .
that is why I am not part of the movement .
they are even well thought scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally do all femin@@ ist women should be inside .
for example , women nowadays nowadays are still less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation if it is about that they may have to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
that is why women and social standards are still aware that women are sooner or later in various sectors of life in a glass of glass , and that discrimination based on the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is conscious of me and well known .

I am a black woman .
yet , when I come to the skin color , on Rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , based on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a : when I mentioned , what kind of we are physically , pastoral and ban@@ ishment of femin@@ ist movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all agree that women - all women should come together to lift their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they do not want to talk about sexual violence on sexual violence against sexual violence , which are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold .
or that black women and women of other Eth@@ ics and Her@@ nia are less harmful than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girl , due to obvious necessity .
or that women in black co@@ h@@ ars and women with mig@@ rating are exposed to a higher risk of violence and violence in the partnership as white women .
on the one hand I want to join all men , all men and all men all of all men of all men and all men of all men and all men of all men of the same rights , and in whose centre the white lady comes into account , which are in their thinking about the generation as well as on the skin color of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m fati@@ gu@@ ed and I don &apos;t want to fight my assignment in a white femin@@ ist @-@ oriented Sp@@ h@@ ist fighting for me and countless other black women ever and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a woman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I gave me an ide@@ ology in which the black woman in historical respect is a simple and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wei@@ gh myself to join me &apos;s group , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not try to isol@@ ate white women the importance of the cuts of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the inter@@ governmental femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different her@@ ds , and is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pray it in front of me and to close me by the femin@@ ism , and to make me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , instead of trying to use my dark skin and my status as a woman in life , which is so stub@@ born to be celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women ourselves according to our own ideas and in the sp@@ aw@@ nings that are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ kaner declar@@ es : as we have rejected us by ourselves , that we can defend ourselves on our own way , and not only that - black women can also be distinguished by ourselves , in which they are fully aware of the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements that will make the black woman .
although some white and inter @-@ secondary femin@@ ists use separ@@ ati@@ sm and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please let us know about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of whom the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I think of black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of my existence as part of my existence as a part of this paradig@@ m .
I , a black woman , in an environment where my life is neither passed , nor ignored .

it is hard to determine how many women really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researchers at the Centro de Tribunal , a social science research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that are not at the level of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;

there were more than 5000 ads in peace with the peace of peace . here , 86 % of ads of women came to women .
in the ads told 40 % of women that they were physically active , 55 % of women and psychological abuse .
however , these statistics show the true level of violence against women in Paraguay .

since women in Paraguay is not a private criminal prosec@@ utor , the prosec@@ ution authorities shall not be adequ@@ ately approved , as many women are murdered by their current or former partners .

before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he was that she named him the name of all its former friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning they wanted it , but then . this should always be for always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but two years ago it was the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most common forms of violence : &quot; &quot; &quot;

Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) that is made of women who are all in any way .
in the group you can talk to other about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ad of mis@@ san@@ ity is a path full of contradictions and a struggle against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Kar@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees big problems in application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft agreement was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ arian parliament , which was known under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # 3 ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ paramet@@ ric ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original design of the law is to explain and harder to explain and harder to unite and harder as it is already in neighbouring countries , Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ature has changed in some point in order to gain the evidence for the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of public debt is forbidden to be illegal and with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original legisl@@ ature had provided that the majority of ( bureau@@ cra@@ tic and economic ) process costs , which would have to be able to contribute to the victims of violence , if they are just a ad and receive a safe place to stop the state .
Ak@@ au@@ ri argued that the Law is not effective unless the legisl@@ ature has no sufficient financial means .
in Paraguay , the destruction is seen as a portion of the human relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary to take place , so that violence is not regarded as a little standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of these facts , he is guilty of guilty , and we@@ pt with that the gates of justice are gone .
we have to register as long as possible until the destruction is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ arian Senate had been approved by the law of law .
the opinions on the changes are apart apart .

ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ehouse RW : at the moment the focus lies on my work on the application of research findings . I support the sam@@ pler for anti@@ angi@@ ity therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research research . we only use solutions that have been developed different .
this must be changed , otherwise we will always remain , instead of himself , instead of himself .
the solutions we get , are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
* Another programmes have incredible functionality but no fantastic interface like your product !
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists to find projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
it is difficult to find people who come back or here , because the financing and development chances are better in other countries .
how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles can be done in your routine research work that you did not had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure corresponds to not the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a constant supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that cri@@ tically thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there are required at special scientific training , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , study of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and growing sick@@ ness ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this .

the Open Source Tools Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Saat@@ gut ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software .
it was founded in life to ensure that some plant species and cells do not be protected as intellectual property and used for plant treatment .
in the context of the initiative , just O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can be assured that others can use of seed seeds .
this does not mean that they do not continue to continue with their seed and sell them . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder allows others to buy it to cruci@@ fy , and to remove it immediately - two aspects that can be b@@ anned from many plants .
it has already been connected to the many years of experience in the future .

the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madi@@ son and O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s committee member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility to empha@@ size new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seed plays an role in larger structures such as bi@@ odiversity , rights of the farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to attempt to make seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emph@@ as@@ ised that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ ds , gene@@ tically changes , or not , from ecological farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we are able to buy control of environmental sustainability , as for example , in August and September 2016 .

the members of the Open Source Center are committed to help others to make their seed @-@ free to help others . thus , their approach is to be used , as opposed to the seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argued that the future of food supply is endanger@@ ed , since the available Gen@@ swimming pool , because of constantly numerous other intellectual property rights to plant materials , that is always limited to limited liability .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Board of O@@ ss@@ i , has been involved in their doctoral thesis with genetic vari@@ ation at car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found that such a third of all the cards is being protected as intellectual property , as it is necessary for plant enz@@ yme .
for other plants there are not yet not yet , but experts as Lu@@ by recomm@@ ends that there is no need to be used to be pat@@ ron@@ ized as wheat or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of visibility
plants are so b@@ oll@@ ed that they remove their taste or their color to such as their taste or their color increases up to such as they are in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ans or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material used for bre@@ eder by becoming more patents than ever before , since the changing conditions are worse than ever before , since the changing conditions have much worse than worse .
in a e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ President Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto , that gene@@ tically diversity and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four business banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company is tailored to the conservation of genetic diversity .
it contradi@@ cts the view that intellectual property has other bre@@ e@@ ders , since &quot; Pat@@ ente and the protection of pesti@@ cides innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan which can be done as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often , these statements can help others to get the same result on the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a matter of protection , but encour@@ ages it by the public and know more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent christ@@ ening , that is certainly no innovations .
and if you are waiting for a long time to get plants , who have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument of Mort@@ on is that genetic resources are always good for a general practition@@ er , neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to make farmers in their work .
this is what we want , and it will be impossible for us if we will not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; they seem to be the USA in the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding programme &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the concept will grow rapidly on all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as professional organization in the resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program is working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfil specific requirements .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it does not be patented for the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits the patent on conventional plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an explanation is yet not a law ; now it is to implement the governments of Member States of the Member States to implement this new line .

all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared its decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that will happen in every big city in the world : murder , Rau@@ b , sexu@@ ality , etc . everything , but what is happening in Rio , will be published in the &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to complete this , so that we do not conclude our eyes before it .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared by Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ rd Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of the failure is :
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a prison@@ er of war in a country that cannot recognize the war .

but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner .
the name &quot; War &quot; is more than they used ?
in a article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasil argued , the journalist Ant@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira , on the contrary , the force of violence against the media and could make it difficult , responsible for the police .
this is not war .
