<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib rough a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib completes the majority of his time, when he comes to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers and his nicotine lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the chief business of his family house, which was born in 1967 to flee their occupation of the West Bank, and was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived in Palestine (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activity, who asks the conservative decision and asks its proven opinion about gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and Rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often sets with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of the Arab world. all these subjects will not only find out in his home town Amman, but also in cities which by Damascus in Syria, according to Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib as someone who is not limited in his mind, and he can feel the offence with people who feel the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"" "" "" "if he doesn't open it, he told him that the American foreign policy is not open." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, irrational what caused by his identity as "Palestinian roaming of the second generation" - so he was born in Jordan and still had never been born in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own life distances" "", "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he added: "I think that I am a person," while he had a man, while he shake the holy month Ramadan in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is scheduled for Muslims to come from sunrise until sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "the jordan law also implies that the public debt of food during the Ramadan illegal is illegal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">On the other hand, Hdaib has some weakness to break with an ancient traditions: on the other hand, a cup of coffee was little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the mud cigarette and the fridge is in the first line of liberty in the nose with the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes the Jordan did not feel a prison under the open heavens, especially if you have a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence it is easy to do basic things - like in the public during Ramadan water to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Ministry launched a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already in the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections to support the Islamic fundamentals - the jordan branch of the Muslims, that the sexual orientation of the Frontierra Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional standards of the country, says the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MEP and former press spokesman for the Islamic Coalition of Dima Tahpenb said in an interview with CNN that the concert was saying in an interview with CNN that the concert was saying in a interview with CNN that the concert has been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world of dangerous beliefs, which represents the well-proven Legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila the jordan the jordan people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is not easy to be silenced Rhetoric, but actually a more clearly visible reality in Jordan joins that in hdaibs work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional sex stories to Leibe, by creating his vision of the fate of Arabic women who made the first sex sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"" "the picture shows the skeleton of a obviously" "" "unknown woman, whose arms and legs up to the corners of the screen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through hands of those who are actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">During the past few years, Jordan did the number of 'Honormorde' - the official outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore stood by the number of the morals in 2016, however, the institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women who tried to support the victims of victims or violence in favour of adequate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to compensate violence from the year 1954, women who are exposed to the threat of family violence, "and for their release, is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family that woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib spread that his work is politically, yet, however, that he is his music that is full of explicit rejection of sexuality, freedom and expression, not of politics.</seg>

<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are on the core is running.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib has published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get, "that can be" - be faith or non-belief, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that barely any man speaks to Jordan about the rights of swings and reading, and that comments for equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been strongly weakened in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Internet program Roya to notice that his comments from the context was torn, rotates and his opinion were marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "at the moment it was unloaded, it was unloaded, but only one worked," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly acknowledged for the Arab HBTQ + community and performs the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals are not anti-Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu's, a poet of the nineteenth century, which is still in the same today thanks to its homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nui could work on the order of the potassium, in the view of the potassium, why can Jordan did not leave Jordan?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government attacks on free expression of expression, and that progressive voices are brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the jordan agreement has received several former foreign ministers and members of the teachers, with the reason why they had voted against the problems in social media and the problems associated with the deep in the land rubbish corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In the face of what is the concert Hdaibs, it is only the tip of the Eisberg - the real challenge is to interpret a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In Jordan, Mashrou 'Leila now honoured the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so far it's Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and internal changes. it is sure that these changes of day to day in the heart of the jordan society will take place in the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, including a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed not only that his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Maybe the region with music, art and literature are a true and fundamental principles - and not by Bombs, Streumunitions and the artificial kind of Tibetan democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as it is, Hdaib will continue straight and therefore resisted resistance.</seg>
