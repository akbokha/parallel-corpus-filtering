but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
he describes a cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al US intelligence agency in which the CIA has literally put the stat@@ ute for a nuclear bomb .
if you sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who doesn &apos;t revol@@ ve the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
almost 10 years the government imposed against cracks and promp@@ ted him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol for the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to condem@@ n and journalists .
according to the European Parliament , the media must publish the right to publish the secret .
but it is impossible to apply this right when the media should not get rid of these information and when they are unable to protect them .
so when the government at Ris@@ en ank@@ lo@@ p@@ ino , he did something to rep@@ ent what many cour@@ age@@ ous rep@@ orters had already had before him : he refused to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en also lived in prison with the risk of prison .
but then , only days before the process , something unusual .
suddenly , though it is essential for years that it would have essential for their case , the demands of government imposed on cracks .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources are becoming less hide .
instead of standing and cracks down to the statements , the digital foot@@ steps could be done for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found the evidence that they were useless to condem@@ n Jeffrey Dean , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens on behalf of condem@@ nation .
- Use &apos; all words present &apos; instead of &apos; exact phrase &apos; .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has condem@@ ned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as a cro@@ codi@@ le .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security is the result of being a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now set the press work on the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty , because the government always has more opportunities to send all of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology of the government to deal with rep@@ lication , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and although they can record them from the moment , in which they contact , instead of after@@ ward , in the testimony .
today we are communication software that had not been written as Ris@@ en &apos;s book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is a real drop , a Open Source transfer system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed from the internet of Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I work .
instead of e @-@ mail , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post .
there you can send documents at high or more information as at any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encryp@@ ted and stored on a server which has access to the relevant news agency .
thus the government does not need more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would be not yet available .
Sec@@ ure@@ list is only a small portion of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments in the world still develop new pro@@ pion@@ age technologies that are all endanger@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snow@@ den has one way to get mis@@ understanding . it is just as important to protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower .
for more information , please visit the websites of local offices for the next few years . or the next environmental guidelines , the alarm to contam@@ inate the water of Flin@@ t may be war@@ med . or the next environmental conditions , the alarm to contam@@ inate us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies are not only intended for those who want to cover the crime but to protect our all Constitutional Rights .
thank you very much .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest Data le@@ ck of the story released . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ anners Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to a declaration . &#93; this week we were posted by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama based on a L@@ eck from 11 million documents in Panama .
the release of this documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers and companies like Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; okay , we need a Anon@@ y@@ mes company . &quot;
we actually watch the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , such as the whole system works as it works .
this has already done very direct consequences .
Iceland has lost the Prime Minister .
there are reports that an allies of the brutal Anti @-@ Syrian Arab dict@@ ators B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s rights companies in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollar to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin has been kidn@@ apped by a narrow friend from children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now it will be a lot more ri@@ cher , and others give the nervous on the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
and now that &apos;s how the P@@ lot of a Ag@@ ent@@ enth@@ ri@@ ll@@ ers or of John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ LOVE .
it seems to be we@@ pt away from you , ordinary people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why should we go to what ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful people are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , and not all their taxes , it means less money for important public services such as health , education , roads .
post subject : re : please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are equ@@ als .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are only used to hide their wealth and wear -- something that we have been discussing about ten years .
I think this whole world is very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how this tax hav@@ ens work .
posts : 63@@ 70 Gender : re : headgear / fac@@ em@@ ask videos # 04 ( e.g. elas@@ tics , her@@ bst )
that is why there is another company in another company where it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for pen@@ alties and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what it is .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter .
probably because there was no famous Americans who arrived in this revel@@ ations of that sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not so that there are not enough Americans to hide their wealth in tax hav@@ ens .
but due to the principle that they work with these controls , Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a less than American customers .
if we would have a data le@@ ck from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information that needs to be less information to get a company as around a libr@@ arians .
this type of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed the staff of school districts , school children .

it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in the practice .
how does it work ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; our investigation was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; African Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the susp@@ icious money in the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were sho@@ cked that all until a lawyer of our investigation , such as he could transfer money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course , no one will be passed on to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single problem .
it is not about a single lawyer who has under@@ gone from our conce@@ aled suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , with the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound delicious as if we could do nothing to do , as if nothing happens to change ; as if it is always the rich and powerful .

during the past few years we have been fores@@ een for more transparency than the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU in the Central regi@@ sters set up at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the un@@ pleasant facts that the USA is behind the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law of both parties have brought a question in the two legislative chambers , but this is not the progress that we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how this Panama @-@ disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means to ensure a greater transparency in the United States and global for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who can see how they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ quar@@ tered companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not well for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to stop this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finish the in@@ contin@@ ence , which now allows this type of control , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the story how I travel@@ ed almost , and in the luggage space of a red Maz@@ zu@@ ela would be enjoyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a day after I had finished my design studies , I made a back@@ grounds .
a type in red cab@@ b@@ age remained , and looked down my things .
he bought one of my works .
he was in the city and made just a road@@ map through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace .
I &apos;m invited him to a beer . he told me as he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistakes , saying , &quot; Where do you know today ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve just met him who would go to Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s really needed . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s really worth it . I will not end it in the luggage room of an dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small suit@@ case !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ve at the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what was I built to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
make a cup of coffee in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got a fear that I went out from the bed , on to@@ fu from the door , and my dor@@ mit@@ es was ab@@ sent from the bed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the art of art which he bought from me depends on today in his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
it was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my vision angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I went to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time ahead , two years later ...
I am not working , almost pl@@ eite , my fellow citizens draws from and the rent will be increased .
I continued that time was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked up .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
I wrote my best friend and new colleagues of Brian Jones : &quot; Brian , I have to make something about . our apartment will be able to make a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can be shared with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast .

three happy guests were allowed to sleep in the air mattress on a wooden floor .
we found it great , and we also .
I am sure , our cheese ham qu@@ ettes , are completely different because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we moved our last guest , the door opened in the castle , star@@ ed Brian and I went to .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former fellow citizens , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , saw us as developers as developers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were waiting for the mis@@ sile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , they did not .
nobody who is still in Tro@@ st would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .

at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people , negative effects .
finally we decided to wait until both hosts as well as guest their en@@ rol@@ ment before we ordered them online .
this week we have discovered something new .
we investigated how probably it is that people trust in each other , depending on how they are the age and place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no surprise , we trust the people most of the most common ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social occurr@@ ence .
it will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of Be@@ ur@@ sion .

then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remind you to know where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just my country , but in N@@ u turned to me the works of others from a civil war in a susp@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city .
I remember how I sail@@ ed -- as we sail@@ ed -- so deeply he went up in my sitting position , and I knew the first time for the first time to be detected .
we went in this night in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then she heard and read the war@@ nings of national Islamic organizations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be aw@@ ned &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; might not be aware of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was , in that week -- the Day that were gathered to themselves to those who were gathered together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not at this first Friday , mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I heard of print on the Muslims or of people that were in the free and sm@@ ashed for him .

it &apos;s not easy to explain themselves .
I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions .
the accus@@ ations are hard to do .
nowadays we can say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we come back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those people want to ban@@ dits and mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they talk of my community like by a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or bad ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ ours is removed as a whole and a good tum@@ our can only be seen under observation .
alternatives are worth@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ ors in the body of the USA , but a life @-@ one organ .
thank you very much !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , invent@@ or and Olymp@@ ian .
will the closing of mos@@ ques America is safer ?
it will perhaps stop to stop a couple of parking but don &apos;t stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to people to consider individuals who are toler@@ ant to prove and bigger citizens .
as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently reported : people are not radical in Mos@@ que .
they are radi@@ ated in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer .
in the radi@@ ological process , it is determined that he will start online . as a result , the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the person who believe , the terrorists were the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ sent their behavior and their ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ y or of faith .
if we want to avoid ra@@ dic@@ alization , we need to keep people to keep the mos@@ que .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a group of bro@@ od for a group like the IS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ods &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups do their ideology demands on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;

it is their bro@@ od to read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
the un@@ fair treatment of Imam told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him because she would have had to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . each priest said to silence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to silence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she told her wrath against the ini@@ quity in the world , they can only bring them in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Prophet created the connection to God and her church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of her anger , he showed her con@@ structive ways for a real change in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what they learned in the mos@@ que learned to join the IS to join the IS .
this was a focus on how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .

how does it affect any other ?

if you look , when the mood against the Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then , this three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the for@@ tification of Iraq and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction of Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expect it .
it can actually be a tool to be the public to stop the foundation of a free society , the rational and good inform@@ al citizen .

during our research , we will often use basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to a such question .
helic@@ opter are known about as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts that can contact you .
during decades , the pilot @-@ controlled flight units can fly between two moving parts : a pro@@ pul@@ sion and a tail@@ gate .

it only has a mo@@ vable part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross sections , no further actuators or controller surfaces , only one propeller .
even though it is mechanical , it happens in the inner life , so that it can be stable and move in the room .

all this , what I had worked , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and love Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at the MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , such as li@@ go sol@@ en@@ oid signals .

I would like to explain what this means .
the light has a wave length that is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , size of your hand .
this is quite convenient . for so you can customize a picture or card of things by adding a number of points coming to you .
for killing it is different .
there are currently 1 users browsing this thread . ( 0 members and 1 guests )
therefore it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that are especially true :
your child &apos;s face about your child .
instead we listen to certain attributes such as sound and height , rhythm and volume to close the history behind it .

&quot; stupid ! &quot; stupid ! &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation shafts .
we can not create any simple images of objects in the All .
but by focusing on changes in ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
if we can convert the wav@@ el@@ table to you , we can literally do the All book@@ outs .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation of two black holes can advise us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which I am very busy .
SH : two black , non rotating holes , circul@@ ated simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , stops the same cir@@ cus with an additional ton@@ ality . this is thus : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a type of motion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; form of motion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which form the wav@@ el@@ ength form . &quot; &quot; &quot;

AA : don &apos;t let us know what that means .

using gra@@ vit@@ ation shafts , it should be possible until the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we never seen we are never seen , and we don &apos;t have a presentation . things that we only have to discover .
in fact , li@@ go was found in the first start of things that we did not expect .
my colleagues at MIT , Matt Evans , a very important member of the li@@ go project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that will bring black holes , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
it is enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are like the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ ir@@ chen for our archaeological work .
it allows us to find entirely different perspectives on the events in the All , on the emergence of the stars and finally on how we went out of chaos .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , my life changes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
but there was a definite time that my life grows deep , and there was an un@@ expect@@ ation . it began with a question of my young@@ est .
for three unbeliev@@ able daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the young@@ est , calls for all &quot; estimates &quot; ,
it would be a wa@@ iter in the south .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her , when I was straight on the jump . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ setting in my family . from there I don &apos;t want to play with them , as soon as you are waiting for me , or whi@@ ther I go , I say yes -- every single time .

I am a neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how to change your life of a second on the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organic , a very small ability to sel@@ ections .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor that tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they are sure of one of the most known one of the most known as &quot; deep @-@ stimulation &quot; . im@@ planted , one electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the switching time of neur@@ ons that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the destiny of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease , which improves under sweat and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very near .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began in 15 years ago .
at the time I was bor@@ ed Ober@@ trau@@ tin and worked on day and night in the emergency recording .
often I received patients with skull @-@ sh@@ epherd @-@ trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that in the brain sh@@ ampoo and trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is mu@@ st@@ ened and the sh@@ utter .
in order to save life , one must decrease the damage .
on the other hand , one has to remove a part because the brain has to be removed too .
instead of susp@@ ecting brain mass , we decided to analyse ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to let the cells grow out of this tissue .
this is no easy task .
the cells of a fabric is comparable to small children which will be taken out of your families .
you need to find the right food , temperature , humidity and the environment to let them grow .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .

he saw among his micro@@ sk@@ op .
this was a great surprise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was exactly as a basic cellular culture . with great green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ rip@@ e cells .
perhaps you have to look out of the bi@@ ology lessons that stem cells are un@@ rip@@ e cells that may turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are in deep , small n@@ ical of the brain .

we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
she never die , she is imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw a new , strange cell population that saw such as stem cells , but was different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed a long time to understand what they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our big her@@ k@@ rin@@ se cells .
you play an important role in our development .
in the stage of F@@ öt@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they receive ourselves ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concent@@ rations of the brain injuries .

one thing is clear -- from these cells we get our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source , the brain tum@@ ours .
we had to prove .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to find a piece of brain from the non @-@ speaking area , and then those cells have exactly so cul@@ tured , as it Jean @-@ François opened
and they then mark colour , to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we made them on the control of the same individu@@ ality .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ transplan@@ tation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of our first questions was : what happens if we did these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are the same cells in damaged brain tissue ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ et we were working with mon@@ keys .
in the first scenario , we made the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they have been made after a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation of injury and irrit@@ ated precisely the same cells and still remained at the same time .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were hal@@ ogen .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that are stain@@ ed in vitro , in the culture of culture .
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help a mon@@ keys to recover from brain injury ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , we trained mon@@ keys with a manual gun task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had to take care p@@ ellets from a tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they had achieved a stable platform level , last we had reached the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is exactly how it would happen to people , become aware of spont@@ ane@@ ously and to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the patients are paraly@@ zed and try to recover with the help of plas@@ tical brain tum@@ ours . it can relax after a certain degree , just as the mon@@ keys .
as we were sure that the A@@ ffe has reached its degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , im@@ planted with its own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side , they see the mon@@ keys that sat in spont@@ ane@@ ously spont@@ ane@@ ously .
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
he is not as precise and not so fast .
they now see , as we formed the cells involved : the same A@@ ffe , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were very exciting results for us .
since this time we have found very much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other newly @-@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still still able to im@@ plant@@ ate them to im@@ plant@@ ate people .
I hope that I can show you soon as we are the human brain the means to heal itself .

J@@ B : Yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .

J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
this depends on the approval of the clinical trial .

democracy in democracy .
we in the west make a big mistake they make them as of course .
we see the democracy not as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to consider it as un@@ changing ge@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that capitalism leads to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that isn &apos;t true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lee KU@@ AN Y@@ ew in Beijing and its great deal in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a flo@@ ur@@ ishing capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics are completely un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report examines all retail channels to provide sector insight .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece , the newly elected Greek government -- has been made clear to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity policy -- not the austerity policy that have been realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there would be no better justi@@ fication for Lee KU@@ AN Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my open friends who would lose myself to me that the democracy would change anything .
I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
I would like to believe that Lee KU@@ AN Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save us the democracy , but that we need to save us a tru@@ sting and immune democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy , our societies will intensi@@ fy our future no@@ ster and our great , new technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3,@@ 4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar invested in all the prosperity produced goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , track equipment and so on .
3,@@ 4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar is equ@@ alled after a lot of money until you play with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar , which is around the same time in the same time and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the pollution and the real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt and un@@ productive capital is not the same as the usual market mechanisms are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is a real wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe &apos;s labour , and consequently , a low demand for the P@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could not invest in which they do not invest in which they do not invest in which they do not invest in which they will not invest .
thus the circumstances of the state is to lead to the body .
that &apos;s my hatred of capitalism --

is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do we understand in democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as a social form , in which the open and the poor as a majority of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ en@@ ical Democracy of course of course too many -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of ath@@ ic democracy due to this expression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision on the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it was not only the right to free expression , but more important and decisive is that they have the right to political engagement with the same tuning program in issues of state intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ en@@ ical Democracy has not kept silent -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a candle is very bright , she is also very light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , today our liberal democra@@ cies won &apos;t have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the gl@@ or@@ rich revolution of 1688 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy is concentrated on free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a pro@@ position for Herr@@ ing .
because the liberal democracy came only on , as a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process of policy , while the economy -- the world of tourism -- a democratic deficit .
in our present democra@@ cies , since the time , the separation of politics and economy began , a unbe@@ ar@@ able struggle between the two instead , by the economy gradually becomes the politics , and they escap@@ ed them .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
it is not at one of the Deg@@ ener@@ ation of its DNA .
it is that one can be in the government and still not in power because the power of politics in the economy is ab@@ rupt and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of prey that is thus sustain@@ ing the animals that nour@@ ishes them , that they should star@@ ve at the end of that reason .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the greater the twin will , and the greater the waste of human labor and the welfare of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , it is obvious that we must gather the politics and economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control is as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a new idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Marxist @-@ Lin@@ ke had already been the idea of 100 years ago and it was not surprising .
the doctrine of the de@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working need@@ y is merely a position as in the ancient Egypt , without any new species of bro@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working need@@ y !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capitalism does it affect energy consumption by automation and robots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is , so long @-@ economy and politics can be higher , the automation is higher and higher , the waste of waste , and social conflicts arise , as it will be very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
we have to re@@ construct the economy and the areas of economy and politics again , and we make sure that we are re@@ turn@@ able to democra@@ ti@@ ze , otherwise we will be able to appear in an illness that we can appear in an illness that can appear in an illness that can appear .
the question is not that capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he brought forth , will survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism by a de@@ yst@@ opia , similar to humans in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in the machines of the universe , or in a high tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in long interviews with the meaning of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ Lin@@ den@@ ies instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ opia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation I want to call you some examples .
in the area of companies : ask a capital market for you , while you work and in which your capital is working for you by a company for the next , and the company -- regardless of what you &apos;re just works -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hypothe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015
no distinction between those who belong to the company but not belonging to them , and employees who are working there , but not part of exchange between capital and work , no large gaps between investment and sp@@ ells , and ultimately , there is no risk of twin eyes .
in the area of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies had a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest threshold land &#93; , in the interest of the whole humanity .
imagine that the entire space trade in this currency , we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos &quot; , in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pays the sum of trading in trade and trading income in the country , in a common funds .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are .
that &apos;s not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed by 1944 .
the problem was that one had to implement the technical standards .
today , we have seen them in particular before the background of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world that I compl@@ ained , is at the same time , at the same time it is preferred , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ gh &apos;s history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ical , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ical .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ yst@@ opia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide to do together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you very much .

Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I told , is Marx &apos;s relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un we cannot create this technological development as a massive decline in the overall economic up@@ turn , which Larry Sum@@ mers as well as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
by transfer@@ ring this crisis from a part of the earth , as we experience it , there will not only be our democra@@ cies dest@@ abili@@ se , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
when this analysis is true , Marx is also relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal , and as key@@ less , and therefore I am totally wrong .
BG : actually , now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t dis@@ connect it , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was the same , the said . BG , in your lecture in Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner in the Red@@ ner you have very clear what you keep from the perspective of the West in China .
do you want to repeat here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the anarch@@ y of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area of the economy -- a fully democratic zone .
in certain respect if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative may be similar to China today in the England of the nin@@ ete@@ enth century .
for -- remember that -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can observe in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second .

Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , for we had the opportunity to make with the Eurozone a new start ,
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said that this is not exactly the same , but that is why the referendum campa@@ ign@@ ed for the referendum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the occasion , on the basis of the Greek registered -- of the way , which was the first proposal , who denied it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what is coming .
the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one tries to find a economic system that is not capable of survival through political will and authorit@@ ism in life , it may be a while , if the change happens , he has ab@@ rupt and destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone is no future when we do not change their structure .
BG , do you have any error in your time as financial ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks at this -- seriously ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a financial crisis , or any minister that claims to 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he claims no mistakes , then that is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the training program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of money to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that gave it not .
they wanted only to bring our government only because they wanted to deal with the institutions they wanted to walk through the euro zone .
they wanted to do not want to realize that she had led a cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worse than the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika of the don@@ ors that have set up this policy : &quot; this was a kol@@ oss@@ arian mistake . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BG : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all that , despite the aggressive war of talks , you seem to be right to be a New Federalist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves .
you need to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they are not over@@ crowded , the frei@@ ghter border forces will destroy the European Union and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not alone for Europe cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the most advanced economy of the world .
if we propose to suggest the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , it appears as well as to the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG , we hope that you are wrong in that point .

they are not suitable to put the parts again and then come to a dec@@ eption .
there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , parts and pieces will continue again , even if the information is un@@ broken -- especially if the brain is an expert .
therefore I am Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and understanding what they belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience . but the decision , how to take up all these parts , and this one show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; doesn &apos;t work in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are wrong when data will start our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and in order to forget that device is pretty useful .
many of you will be ...

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most probably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most probably &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have met some decisions in my life , and I would have to hear in the ball at the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how you know of course if you want to have the data available , you would like to replace this by a bit of cl@@ oned , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic design .
this is perhaps the ball kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger . finally , it is about us to make decisions when we want something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I am this as a very encouraging message that it &apos;s still pays out to be able to make decisions , an expert in which you do , and to enter risks .
because at the end it &apos;s not the data but the risks to land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
