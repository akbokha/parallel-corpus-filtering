<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">He describes a catastrophal US intelligence agency in which the CIA has literally put the statute for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If you sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who doesn't revolve the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years the government imposed against cracks and prompted him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblower to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the European Parliament, the media must publish the right to publish the secret.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when the media should not get rid of these information and when they are unable to protect them.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government at Risen anklopino, he did something to repent what many courageous reporters had already had before him: he refused to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen also lived in prison with the risk of prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, though it is essential for years that it would have essential for their case, the demands of government imposed on cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources are becoming less hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of standing and cracks down to the statements, the digital footsteps could be done for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Vampire Diaries" "" "castet Leslie-Anne Huff für S7" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card and even travel-wise with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found the evidence that they were useless to condemn Jeffrey Dean, a CIA whistleblower and Risens on behalf of condemnation.</seg>
<seg id="23">- Use 'all words present' instead of 'exact phrase'.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as a crocodile.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security is the result of being a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we now set the press work on the game that will be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government always has more opportunities to send all of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government to deal with replication, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And although they can record them from the moment, in which they contact, instead of afterward, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today we are communication software that had not been written as Risen's book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a real drop, a Open Source transfer system for Whistleblower, originally developed from the internet of Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of e-mail, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can send documents at high or more information as at any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server which has access to the relevant news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thus the government does not need more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would be not yet available.</seg>
<seg id="36">Securelist is only a small portion of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments in the world still develop new propionage technologies that are all endangered." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snowden has one way to get misunderstanding. it is just as important to protect the next Whistleblower.</seg>
<seg id="39">For more information, please visit the websites of local offices for the next few years. or the next environmental guidelines, the alarm to contaminate the water of Flint may be warmed. or the next environmental conditions, the alarm to contaminate us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies are not only intended for those who want to cover the crime but to protect our all Constitutional Rights.</seg>

<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest Data leck of the story released.] [what does this mean?] [we banners Robert Palmer from Global Witness to a declaration.] this week we were posted by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama based on a Leck from 11 million documents in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The release of this documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>

<seg id="51">And now that's how the Plot of a Agententhrillers or of John-Grisham-LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be wept away from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "why should we go to what?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful people are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and not all their taxes, it means less money for important public services such as health, education, roads.</seg>

<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are equals.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are only used to hide their wealth and wear -- something that we have been discussing about ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think this whole world is very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how this tax havens work.</seg>

<seg id="60">That is why there is another company in another company where it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for penalties and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what it is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there was no famous Americans who arrived in this revelations of that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not so that there are not enough Americans to hide their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that they work with these controls, Mosque Fonseca less than American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information that needs to be less information to get a company as around a librarians.</seg>

<seg id="1110">If you solve a complex problem, do you do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">You have to analyse this problem in its individual parts so you can analyze the details; as a branch, you will receive the details again to make a deception.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but it's always two things: apart, and retraced again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to fix a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts again and then come to a deception.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, parts and pieces will continue again, even if the information is unbroken -- especially if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore I am Netflix so successful because they have data and understanding what they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience. but the decision, how to take up all these parts, and this one show like "House of Cards" doesn't work in the data.</seg>

<seg id="1133">But how you know of course if you want to have the data available, you would like to replace this by a bit of cloned, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic design.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This is perhaps the ball klüger and klüger and klüger. finally, it is about us to make decisions when we want something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I am this as a very encouraging message that it's still pays out to be able to make decisions, an expert in which you do, and to enter risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it's not the data but the risks to land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
