<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestion system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study concludes exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh based proteins and milk products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000, causing stomach crabs and blood flow, weight loss and extreme strain, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the patient may occur, meat and dairy products were out to prevent their symptoms and found the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteine to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared the immune cells in the intestines to ensure that harmful microorganisms that enter into the body not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that can be triggered, inflammatory cells are exposed to cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without preaching tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is susceptible in the direction of inflammation, it can result from a inflammatory intestinal bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments in experiments was established that a type of tolerance conveyors in mice comes to a particular bacterium.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to replace the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterium and Lactobacillus - which is a normal part of the intestine, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan the powers in their food, the more they had them from these immunity. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He smote himself that the combination of L. reuteri and an an Tryptophan deficient diet is tolerated, less inflammatory bowal milieus, if the same system also occurs in humans.</seg>

<seg id="2593">They are used to do the difference with the intestinal microbiomen of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">As a result, DNA sequencing were found in the mice, which were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them inferior to mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were not developed in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiom did not have developed and they were developed at L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">Scientists from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and their colleagues from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and their colleagues from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and their colleagues from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI).</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it became known as a side-product of the Tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers showed the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells were about 50 per cent, but if the tryptophemp could decreased in half of the cells around half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan announced that people have tolerant tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-secondary products made from L. reuteri the cells in humans are developing as with mice, but defects in cast in relation to Tryptophan was found in humans.</seg>
