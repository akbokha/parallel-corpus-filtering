as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ ometric a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a to review by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
&quot; at the first study , almost 8 000 older women with O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and it was examined the number of sp@@ aci@@ al and hip sculptures by a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study published 2 127 men and women with O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , the number of groups were examined by a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , Ac@@ la@@ sta has been tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and six months long with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; main indi@@ k@@ ator for effectiveness was , whether the percentage of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( a enzym@@ m , the bone conduc@@ ts ) in the blood of normal or at least 75 % compared to the output . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of anti@@ biotics have been reduced under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) over a period of three years in comparison to the patient under Plac@@ ebo to 70 % . &quot;
in comparison of all patients among Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ cal ) with those under Plac@@ ebo was reduced by 41 % .
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip resistance , 9 % of patients with acet@@ one ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients among the patients among the patients among the patient ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta will come within the first three days after the in@@ fusion process and are less frequent .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be applied to patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other substances .
&quot; as for all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ation , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion , and O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides a medical material for doctors , the Ac@@ la@@ sta for treatment of O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , which contains information such as the medicines , as well as a similar material for patients who should contact the side effects of the drug . &quot;

&quot; during the following treatment of liver , kidney and cardiovascular diseases were not used in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including Tran@@ splan@@ tation or other side effects that can occur in the result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ or or over@@ ex@@ position . &quot;
patients should always be re@@ tained the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; circulation of form@@ ulation or the regime should only be carried out under the transplan@@ tation of a transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

&quot; Adv@@ ate shall be used for treatment and prevention of blood vessels in patients with H@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lie A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ary , alleged blood flow interference ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application can be applied to the treatment of blood cells or to prevent blood sugar at surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with H@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lie A suffer from a factor VIII , lack of blood pressure , such as blood vessels in the joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not made of human plasma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is one of the other in the European Union called rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar to which the medicines has no proteins in proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe damage to medium H@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lie A , among a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug has been examined . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of blood vessels in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of dis@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ del , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to patients , which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against the human brain factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ ster@@ oid or another of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission to the European Commission of B@@ ax@@ ter AG is a permit for the in@@ solvency of Adv@@ ances in the whole European Union . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment of treatment , the determination of inj@@ unc@@ tions and frequency of inj@@ ections is an appropriate determination of the factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can be achieved in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery , and different half @-@ value times . &quot;

&quot; if the expected factor of VIII plasma systems can &apos;t be achieved , or if the blood has not be carried out with a reasonable dose , a test is carried out to obtain an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ isation , it is possible that the factor VII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic actions must have to do . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exce@@ eded . &quot;
the formation of neutral anti@@ bodies ( In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known cure for treatment of patients with H@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lie A .

&quot; for adults and young children from 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ on@@ ze twice a tablet that should be taken by a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as possible as possible as possible , as soon as the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the no@@ des . &quot;
a treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be carried out using the nose .
&quot; the main test dimensions were the changes of the heavy duty of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , which were treated by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study the patients had their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary , and with a standard sk@@ ala , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; with regard of all hypo@@ cris@@ s symptoms , except the con@@ sen@@ sion of the nose does the patients , the aer@@ os@@ ze took the patients , the aer@@ ospace symptoms over 4@@ 0.0 % compared with 35,@@ 9 % compared to the patients who had pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;

&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. to the Committee for Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) officially declared that the company will bring his request to the in@@ solvency of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the pre@@ ventive H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 Influ@@ enza at adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be caused by adults and older people to protect against flu that are caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the Influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vacc@@ ine which may cause a trunk of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus , which may cause a future panic cause . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ de@@ y breaks out when a new trunk of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus may be caused by man to man , because the people still have no immune system ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to the vacc@@ ination of the vacc@@ ine det@@ ects the immune system , the immune system is used in the vacc@@ ine of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus as &quot; physical imp@@ unity &quot; and forms of anti@@ bodies . &quot;
this is the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus .
&quot; then the membrane cover of the virus is used with the &quot; surface coating &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , the human body as physical body as physical body . ) , clean@@ sed , and an integral part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the studies showed that the study is not done according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; in this way , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the vacc@@ ine does not affect the requirements of the vacc@@ ination of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ ventive vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; should you need to participate in a clinical examination and further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor doctor . &quot;

&quot; for patients who do not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ als can be taken as a solution that can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ war@@ ase should only be considered , when the physician has been tested , which has been developed , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the patient has taken the virus to the medicines . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily that can be taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ vir@@ al drug .
&quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ war@@ ase after the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drug use the HIV amount of blood , and keeps them on a low level . &quot;
&quot; they are not too heal , however , however , the cause of immune system , and thus the development of the immune system , and the development of AIDS associated infections and disorders . &quot;
&quot; A@@ war@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al cancer , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ in@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; that with low temperature , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ampli@@ fiers A@@ war@@ ase was taken in 206 adults that had previously been modified with other prot@@ otypes . &quot;
&quot; the general indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentr@@ ations of HIV in blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the studies with patients who had no prot@@ otyp@@ ed to 48 weeks under A@@ war@@ ase more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last under 400 copies / ml as under Plac@@ ebo , but A@@ war@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for children reduced A@@ war@@ ase , the Vir@@ us@@ last , however , however , of the children who were treated with prot@@ esters , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults that were treated with Prot@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drugs A@@ war@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment , as well as other prot@@ ru@@ ined treatment : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was opposed to four other prot@@ otypes together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , it came under A@@ war@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to four weeks as in the patients who were able to continue their previous prot@@ otypes . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ war@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ h@@ ö ( flow ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , break , skin and f@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients , which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r or another of the other components . &quot;

&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) to the end , that the benefits of A@@ war@@ ase used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drug use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al cancer and children over four years . &quot;
&quot; A@@ war@@ ase will be taken in the rule together with the cer@@ vi@@ onic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee confirmed that the benefit of A@@ war@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had no prot@@ ested in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r patients who had no prot@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; A@@ war@@ ase was originally found under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; since the time of the permission from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission has launched the European Commission on the company of Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited , an approval for the in@@ coming of A@@ war@@ ase in the whole European Union . &quot;

&quot; the result of un@@ bent A@@ war@@ ase is based on two hypothe@@ tical scenarios , with a total of 288 HIV @-@ based children in the age of 2 to 18 years , by which 152 with PI were treated . &quot;

the majority of the patients had been given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) or two ( 42 % ) .

&quot; there is no effect on the concentration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , but no effect on the concentration of Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) of the food intake is influenced by the food intake the extent and the rate of Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the distribution volume is about 430 mm ( 6 l / kg by a body weight of 70 kg ) , and can be used on a large distribution volume , as well as a high level of penetration of the blood circulation in tissue . &quot;
&quot; these changes leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ born Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r , which is likely to remain unchanged . &quot;

&quot; the gift of A@@ war@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice , or 15 mg / kg three times , leads to a similar daily Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r ex@@ position as for adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ stra@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bi@@ oph@@ thal@@ ates than consists of the capsules ; therefore A@@ war@@ ase solution and A@@ war@@ ase capsules not found on a milli@@ metres .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ s ( CH@@ MP ) , a negative report , in which the provision of the approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis 6 million IE is recommended . &quot;
&quot; this means that the alph@@ abet is a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medical @-@ effective component , which is already in the EU . &quot;
Alph@@ abet should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic diseases ( long @-@ hal@@ otherapy ) hep@@ atitis C ( one by a virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ simulation of the liver tissue , the liver tissue damage on , also the values of the liver tissue is increased by the liver tissue ( AL@@ T ) in blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active ingredients .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon laid data before the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , ( active structure , composition and p@@ urity of the drug , certainty , security and effectiveness of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of the Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of reference . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the study was measured as many patients to 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of virus in blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns have concerns that data for the stability of the active ingredients and the market is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C based on treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A calls was similar to clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with the alph@@ abet , the disease in more patients come back to the reference spec@@ s ; in addition , Alph@@ eon more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from the study of the question of the question , how ew@@ eit the medication is a immune system ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicines ) , not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ er ( one with a patient treatment ) , and small in@@ doors ( Ris@@ s- or cutting ) , ab@@ dic@@ ed and gri@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go shall not be used for treating infections , the white or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ ine resistance hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections may not be . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the treatment of the skin is no longer than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s patient after two to three days , the doctor should pay attention to patients again and alternative treatments . &quot;
the bacteria of bacteria that can be produced by bacterial infections ( the parts of the bacteria where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
&quot; in all five studies of the percentage of patients , their infection after the end of the treatment was used . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under the treatment of Plac@@ ebo .
&quot; at the same time , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ alli@@ in similar contact rates : if the results of both studies have been overcome during the treatment of both groups . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go at the treatment of canc@@ er@@ ths ( ei@@ ter@@ filled @-@ filled joints in body tissue ) or infections , the white or probably by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common @-@ effect effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a friction at the contrac@@ tor .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) to the end , that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go at the short @-@ surface treatment of the following surface treatment : • Im@@ pe@@ z , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , Ab@@ brevi@@ ations or impl@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission will bring the European Commission to meet Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients suffering from two to three days are not allowed to be examined and an alternative therapy in account ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensitivity , or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be shall be covered by the treatment of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA as a path@@ o@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .

an alternative therapy should be taken into account when after a 2 @-@ 3 days or two @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the affected application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means at the same skin is not examined and the current application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .

&quot; in the decision , whether it should be finished / expi@@ red or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefits of the food and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with a surface area of skin inf@@ ections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , was the most common interest of Ir@@ rit@@ ation , which was about 1 % of the patients . &quot;

the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selected hem@@ isph@@ ere of bacterial protein molecules by interaction on a specific binding area of the bacterial ri@@ ches of the bacteria of other ri@@ pen@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ulation of the bacterial infections .
data indicate that the B@@ ind@@ entation of ri@@ pen@@ al protein L@@ 3 are involved in the region of ri@@ pen@@ al P @-@ bending station and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .

to protect against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years old against these two diseases .
&quot; in the framework of a two @-@ existing vacc@@ ine , a protection against hep@@ atitis B may be achieved only after the second dose . &quot;
this reason may only be used if the immune system is a low risk of hep@@ atitis C infection .
&quot; if a total dose of hep@@ atitis A or B , you can be given an am@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis B or B vacc@@ ine . &quot;
vacc@@ ines affect the immune system ( the natural de@@ contamination of the body ) .
&quot; after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign @-@ &quot; and generates anti@@ bodies . &quot;
the in@@ active vacc@@ ine contains the same components such as the 1996 @-@ approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ Â adults and since 1997 .

&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known for the first permission of the In@@ struc@@ tor , the CH@@ MP the view that the benefit risk ratio for am@@ rix is positive . &quot;
&quot; however , however , however , only in a membership state ( in the Netherlands since 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug has been limited . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in the age of over a month with in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ity or with a complete end@@ ocr@@ yst@@ opathy in the history of the history .
&quot; ammon@@ ite is divided into several types of meals - split , under the food , or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ os ( through the abdom@@ inal belt in the stomach of the stomach ) or a no@@ ens@@ on@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of the stomach ) or a no@@ ens@@ on@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; this is not a comparable study , because of ammon@@ ia cannot be compared with another treatment or with Plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ quarter , i.e. without any active substances ) . &quot;
&quot; it can also be used for appeti@@ te loss , a ab@@ rup@@ tive acid content in the blood , deport@@ ation , head@@ ache , abdom@@ inal or taste , abdom@@ inal pain , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , abdom@@ inal , unpleasant body , unpleasant body , unpleasant body , unpleasant body weight . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) lead to the end that ammon@@ ite patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle comes to high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; ammon@@ ite was admitted under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because due to the sel@@ dom of the disease at the time of the approval only limited information about this medicine models . &quot;
&quot; the use is in all patients with all patients , where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ity had already manifest@@ ed in the New Apostolic Church ( within the first 28 liver age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a delay of delayed form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ity , which is manifest after the first life of manifest@@ ing ) , then a indications for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ opia . &quot;
&quot; for acid , for children who don &apos;t work in the location , tablets , or for patients with lu@@ ck@@ dys@@ function is AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form . &quot;
the daily dose is suitable for the protein toler@@ ances and the growth and the development of the daily protein intake of patients .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal day of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ es@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and with Her@@ mig@@ ua and adults . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar ) , for example , inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in breast gir@@ dle with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ arina ( a an@@ om@@ al measurement ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood sugar in patients who used a higher dose and the In@@ fusion can be used up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can increase the blood flow of the blood flow to the heart and to increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; almost 14 000 patients took part of the main study on the treatment of ACS parts , which was compared with a gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI has been used to prevent a st@@ ent ( a short distance ) , which is used in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie to prevent one lock , and they received other medicines to prevent blood flow , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ ma@@ b and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - at the reduction of new events ( deaths , heart rate or Rev@@ ask@@ force ) after 30 days or a year , as well as the conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in relation to all indications such as hep@@ atic , except in severe blood , in which it was significantly more effective than hep@@ atic . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox cannot be applied to patients which may possibly be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components are used . &quot;
&quot; it may also be applied to patients who had recently had a blood , as well as people with strong blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ist agents ( CH@@ MP ) to the end , that An@@ gi@@ ox at the end , that An@@ gi@@ ox at the end of the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a ann@@ elling replacement for hep@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission to company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for In@@ gi@@ ox of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union . &quot;
treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ act ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Hebre@@ ws ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency handle or if a early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox at patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ b of 0.1 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out a PCI , a additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1,75 mg / kg / h / h . &quot;
after the PCI can be added to clinical requirements again the reduced weight dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt securing of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox at patients with a PCI is made of a initi@@ al intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ tice of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of the subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the security and effectiveness of a all@@ way Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on 225 seconds , a second bolt securing of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the possibility of low ACT values , it should be carefully mixed and tested medication before the application carefully mixed and the bol@@ us@@ dose of intra@@ ven@@ ous medication . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is necessary , the 1,75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is correct . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ hard kidney compounds ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din ) should be used to be treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din ) should be used for a lower risk rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;

&quot; in one study , A@@ pi@@ dra can be examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the change of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ osis hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in blood , which shows how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; due to the reduced gluten capacity , the ins@@ ulated capac@@ itor of the ins@@ ulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; each change of the active thickness , the brand ( her@@ ds ) , the ins@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ able , etc . ) , the type of the ins@@ ins ( animal Insul@@ in ) and / or the manufacturing method can go to a change of the ins@@ ulin requirements . &quot;
