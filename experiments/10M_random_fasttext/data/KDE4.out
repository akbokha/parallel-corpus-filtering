met@@ adata are defined as data via data . met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata are defined according to your definition data that can be managed by a application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , you need not know how many photos you do not have to save a certain photo . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need and know before you have to be organized before you have to be organized on your computer , if you want to save others on your computer , whether they want to save you on a daily drive &amp; etc ; if you want to switch to a power drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc . &quot;

what types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the for@@ kli@@ ft processing easier . keep new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration .
&quot; we recommend the option to save the met@@ adata in order to activate the met@@ adata into the file of met@@ adata into the file . if you forget this , you can save the met@@ adata from the database to select the corresponding point . &quot;
now you have a lot of information in your database but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ?
&quot; now , you can choose all images that require the same attribute , and a review of course . of course you can choose all images that require the same attribute and the value . this makes sense that you can focus on the best quality photos . &quot;
all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
&quot; if you want to import your images from another source with built @-@ in images , then click the images to the right place . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different met@@ adata fields are cut , as each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data can be of all images . &quot;
enough of the sample - the next section refers to the ri@@ vals or comments in the third important tool for your met@@ adata .
&quot; you want to know most of your photos simply simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; watch this panorama . from the distance you can see a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , place . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re going to dream of the flight , you might have to dream of the rest of the flight . &quot;
&quot; if you have images , the key is more important than the image itself to create a interest . if you want to show a story . remember , the key is it the importance to the viewer , which you need to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is in order when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a coating for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; you can export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE offers you a lot of text , in a global alph@@ abet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a choice of images . you can also use it for a selection of images . &quot;
do you remember the time before GPS ? as you find in a different city without navigation system ? it was not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of the light presentation is already covered with light speed . &quot;
&quot; I am sure that one day , the photos will be ex@@ changed into the future , you can also use K@@ ML files . &quot;

&quot; of course , we talk about CDs that can be lost in the street or a fire . this type of loss are the same for you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company of the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must not be able to get more than a few years . of course you can learn CDs and DVDs in the archive quality of life . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting and the control . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a che@@ apest program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster all the wonders at CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications that damaged data from damaged disk@@ s , hard media , USB drives etc . &quot;

&quot; this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a power if you have secured data loss due to a current situation . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices are not much larger than the devices can take advantage of the device , such as devices , hardware and high @-@ speed processes are different . this can cause severe damage to your computer , such as a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against power is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that contains a part of the energy balance and the rest . it is normally in shape of an connector bar . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should be able to protect the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage of each cable , you should be connected to your computer that can be connected to your system . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for emergency braking and therefore very small and you contain the protection for modem modem . &quot;
&quot; during a over@@ voltage protection your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you to invest in a complete loss . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection of over@@ voltage devices , these devices can be operated automatically in addition to the protection of over@@ voltage . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be exposed to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you think that it is possible for less than &amp; euro ; &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are in comparison to the hard drives on the hard disk , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; limit ; 75 per year and 400 GB . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com will be available online . &quot;
&quot; with the TCP protocol , the Web Solutions is very safe . &quot;
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer .
&quot; the worst thing is that you do not have no protection against you . all these problems remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection against it . it &apos;s pretty obvious that it should not be destroyed in your computer . it &apos;s pretty much fun that it should be done in your computer . it &apos;s pretty much easier to give it . the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer data away than the computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source for transmission ratio as they are inter@@ medi@@ ated within the data streams . in normal file systems , this error was un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not in the future , you should look at the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who are available with plate defects on low level . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available at the GPL . read this article in english . &quot;

&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the chis@@ els . it leads to a less damage , as a theft , or new installations . and it is currently at Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less common for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ inct , travel FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to find the widespread file systems . &quot;
&quot; if a file is not fully stored in the procedure , only the speed of the trial process was avoided . if a file is not fully stored before the problem is lost . &quot;
viruses are the largest threat for digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main subject for data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries .
today &apos;s cameras go into the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already high for compact cameras and the En@@ der@@ able result . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ apixel and a high @-@ quality appearance are the optimal solution for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you can do anything other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected in each year of data loss . therefore , you may have any other data loss of data loss of your operating system , exchange of plates or sizes of hard disk drives . &quot;
&quot; if one day , one day , one day , a flash is not connected when the drive is not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . : &quot;
&quot; thus , Des@@ kt@@ ops is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ ishes the stair@@ way up to the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there are another advantage of the physical separation : as above , is an important reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup you have not available immediately , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files will be secured .
&quot; differential protection : a backup of files that were changed since the last complete complete change . creates a complete moment of time : the complete protection and the last differential protection . &quot;
&quot; a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . however , several moments of files have been changed to any time . you can use the original status at any time . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful tool that you can set slightly on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP client or other types of file extensions . this happens , and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh . &quot;
you can choose important images directly after you have stored on your computer to a DVD or another image file .
&quot; at the end you have a complete version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly version of the work files . at the end you have a whole daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly schedule for every month and a moment for every month . every other stam@@ ina should be done manually , after which you have a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : met@@ adata , display of images and met@@ adata , the photos on the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; with this valuable pictures the next 40 year , it is about the time of time in which you really are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be taken : &quot;
&quot; since the future of your nature is un@@ predictable , you will be able to leave everything that today is compatible with caution and updated during the time . unfortunately there are no other possibility to rate the current system in the past . &quot;
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for every available . if you have a old system , the reading of your images is important , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other side , the Council are quite simply : jed@@ es@@ times when you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary for a new standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size .
&quot; you can copy the sc@@ rolling plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this field and on a new plate : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new plate from the system has been detected , but you don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; you will find these under &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Privacy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create this task by year . &quot;

&quot; if you prefer a different colour , you can choose this here . if you prefer a different colour , you can select this here . you can use the tool box when you use the images on full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; you can set the images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery slider options . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ scribe , the images placed in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ escent than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the appropriate statement . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of PNG files , you can reduce the size of PNG files . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can use this value on a high compression . &quot;
the TIFF files will be compressed to TIFF files . this reduces size of the TIFF photos . it has no influence on the image quality because of the prob@@ ate -@@ free loss .
&quot; if you select the loss of losses , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than when normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , Met@@ adata is not supported , but in planning . &quot;
&quot; you can change the images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery slider options . &quot;
&quot; when you use this option , you can use this problem with a minimal loss of the CCD sensor . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . &quot;
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance that is based on a white card that is based on a white map that is based on a white map that is based on a white map .
this setting is only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect to get more details in four steps more details in the peak . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the peak , so the parts of your pictures are used in the settings , because of the in@@ ability of your camera can be seen in the settings . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , since blue pixel is not as quickly as quickly as green and red . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the option to set up a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image . &quot;

&quot; in times of the chemical processing of solar processing , solar processing was called a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then the development of the image has been observed . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust these interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controlled the solar cell . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is to create a neg@@ ativity that is not on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is ( 1 ) and the edited ( 2 ) .
&quot; the Vi@@ vid Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it is characterized by a satur@@ ation , that he has a stronger control effect , the colours are brilliant and mir@@ r@@ ored . try it , he wa@@ ited many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name of the Japanese company FU@@ J@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ atic , and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours and high yield . &quot;
the Ne@@ on@@ Filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the control edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the rails repeat the strength of the ne@@ on@@ au@@ ts . in large pictures you can adjust the whole CPU for a moment .
&quot; digital cameras have frequently problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to change the colour tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the button 1 and you will be applied in the preview . &quot;
&quot; if you can make a photo at bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : a great choice to increase the satur@@ ation , instead of it . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tools and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / G@@ amma is very complicated , even if the dialog is very complicated , you need to specify the field of the layer . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph@@ s of the int@@ ric@@ ation values , a hist@@ ogram of the active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three rails in which it can be seen in order to change the int@@ ric@@ ation values of the picture . &quot;

sc@@ aling : with this selection process can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic Y axis is displayed in this case it is the log@@ ari@@ th@@ fulness of useful information .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , medium for the bright tones , and the most common for the middle tones , often as Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three colour holes can be used in the preview of the original image in order to adjust the loading values of the shadow , medium and light tones . furthermore , there are a button for a fully automatic wat@@ ering . &quot;
the output values are used to change the output values for each field . there are two controls that can be used to change the output values for each field . the compression of the output values can be used as a background to create something else in the for@@ eg@@ round .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values automatically set up automatically by the Int@@ ell@@ ability of the image . &quot;
save as and shop : with this buttons you can be stored in the file system and later it will be loaded again . this will be used for the Gim@@ p levels .

&quot; if you want to move a cur@@ b to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that bright tones with dark output format and the associated image files are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark . if you want to change this link , a matching line on the curve you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve can be stored in the file system , and later be loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow and sun . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ine . &quot;

the preview of the dest@@ iny features a red marker . if you move this in the picture shows a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate colour value .
&quot; the controls for the module are the right below : controller for red , green and construction allow you to add the corresponding color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , particularly if you use Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour is in the same place , which is in the same place at the same place in the color channel , and their space forms in each channel . if the case is different , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ rom , even in the case of the environment . &quot;
&quot; to save the storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any any mixer setting can be used for later , then download the used file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ channel format format . &quot;
the option of over@@ drive indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to find the combined result of all channels . this is a indication that you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect at the final result .

use OK when you want to install the preview on your image . the image is adapted to automatic preview size .
&quot; at the same time , three different tools are available . each of you have the advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gr@@ illed images . &quot;
&quot; you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st , and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; however , the best of three are really the best of the three , because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
&quot; the same phenomenon can be printed on paper , but the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . this is the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras require a little bit . the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras are usually more easily accessible than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in the case of JPEG images , often a camera can have been used in the raw format . pictures in the raw format is always in during processing . &quot;
&quot; for example , you will get the control over your image . if you want to disable this link , you will get the control via your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get the results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing tool . this can be shar@@ pen@@ ed with the menu item Kor@@ rig@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; you should be able to work with this , because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also the noise of the edges . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too slow . the solution that image is a bit soft to capture , is much easier than it . use the tool to soft signs with the menu entry of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter Un@@ cut is a very good tool to remove white from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview can help the image to edit the image of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radi@@ us and the amount . &quot;
&quot; the radi@@ us represents a like many pixel on each page of a can@@ ister through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radic@@ als . they should not shar@@ pen@@ ed in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount of the percentage is added between the original and the desired image , which is added to the original . &quot;
&quot; the sw@@ elling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the difference of the difference . one can be avoided with a soft change between the pot@@ tery , and therefore the beauty of the body are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example for the invisible filter of the filter . the original image is ( 1 ) and that worked image ( 2 ) . the original image is ( 1 ) and that worked image ( 2 ) . un@@ bent = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sponge value = 0.0 . &quot;

&quot; this tool tries to shar@@ pen a picture to &amp; quot ; it uses a technology named FI@@ R Wiener filter@@ ing . this is better approach than just to try the photo by FI@@ R Wiener filter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in practice , the circular saw is much better than the pal@@ ate . &quot;
this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module .
cor@@ relation : an increase of cor@@ relation can help reduce the cor@@ relation between 0 @-@ 1 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
&quot; the filter can be generated from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . &quot;
&quot; if you do not use a value to this value , you should be able to do this value on 0 . if you use a value to this value , you may also increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , the module is very slow if you select a value for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and shop buttons will be used for this purpose . each of any Ref@@ ri@@ mental parameter you have to be stored for later , and then will be loaded . &quot;
try all cutting and int@@ ric@@ acies on the picture before you use the module .
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you use the image otherwise . &quot;
&quot; if you read images and compressed , &amp; save ; as JPEG , you should use the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally it causes better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the in@@ sharp mask .
&quot; theore@@ tically , the use of the FI@@ R Wiener filter is always at least as well as the in@@ verter mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better at the editing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different materials , on a small in@@ active picture , see : &quot;

&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and film @-@ Scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter . the tool is used to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter . the tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vign@@ et@@ able correction data and with three further the exposure of the target . &quot;
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , what a optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , and a light intensity of 2 , relaxed @-@ clean@@ .@@ Incre@@ ases the density by a larger degree of Vign@@ et@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the controls of one image , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of a image with the Vign@@ et@@ ness correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you must be able to increase the exposure of the target with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re@@ load of the monitor &apos;s target , then let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; amp ; you can select the gra@@ dation from the menu . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ness correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ et@@ ers in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ oven and control correction was also carried out at the image with this tool . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is a tool to complete the effect of spher@@ ical lens to photos . it uses copyright protected by David Ho@@ ckey . &quot;
this tool works with geomet@@ ric st@@ oves . color adjustment can not be corrected with this tool .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ des are treated by the general geometry of the lens , and the con@@ ical or con@@ ical form of the image . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ ding has a similar effect , fla@@ p but to the edges . this correction is not used in the mold . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des is corrected to the second gra@@ des . if you can combine these two combine different geometry .
&quot; general : this value increases the strength of the delay . with negative values , ton@@ utri@@ ents are corrected and positive values . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value increases the strength of the delay in the middle of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you are already our customer , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . : &quot;
&quot; light : this value represents the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values , the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values are increasing . &quot;
&quot; in order to find the best filter settings , the dialog is used for your image , stored and when standard values are used as standard values . &quot;
&quot; if you have a picture to cut out a picture to cut or change to size , if you have a picture to cut it a picture to cut it out of a picture . if you have a picture to cut it a picture , then the effect of the effect would be damaged . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to find the best standards , this tool is a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line . move it to a important place , such as the marine base or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse to the lines at this place . &quot;
&quot; if you have an unwanted parts , the resulting image of black corners have the resulting image of black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu , to remove the images from the jQuery Slider window . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like recordings from front , frame and pictures it is the perspective so that all angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that you will be able to keep the camera with the hand . &quot;
this is an example for the ton@@ al correction on a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ asse ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the F@@ enst@@ ers you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle , you can move the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters of film gr@@ itt and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option of the film gr@@ itt and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; since the filter color channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green system makes no sense of the effect on Black / White photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infrared fil@@ ming on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image has been set to ISO 400 . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 .
&quot; this is the classic high @-@ speed film like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , known as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , known as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , known as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; if you want this special , you can use Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery slider options . &quot;
&quot; the control can be used to control the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the b@@ ner . the default value is , although often higher values are required to use ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more power , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film gr@@ ind effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the user @-@ sensitive to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;

the options horizontal are reflected and vertical characteristics can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic part .
&quot; with the button colour you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you can add a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to adjust the camera on the camera or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things around a angle . you can use this with the &amp; amp ; you can adjust the target angle and adjust the target angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this rails are specified in degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the picture . the new dimensions of the image will be displayed on the right side of the picture .

the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to the met@@ adata of a picture and edit the loc@@ alization of the picture and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available in order to locate images of a geographical location , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . &quot;
&quot; to convert your images with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ cable and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . these interface may lead a number of selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images that you want to download the cor@@ relation between time and loc@@ alization through time , you need to load a trace file with G@@ PX file . this file contains information about the same time as the same time as images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , a automatic cor@@ relation is performed in red . GPS navigation data will be recorded in GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives the maximum devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera space . the devi@@ ation among the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
&quot; if you have no trace data from a site , you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add images to images . the time difference between 2000 seconds will then add all images in this area . &quot;

&quot; once you have the features on your pictures , you can print it in the browser . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview window , then you can add the images to the images by clicking the letters to the notice if the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the Gem@@ old will not be stored with the picture , but in the database . &quot;
in this way you can see a picture on the picture of the context menu . to select the picture from the context menu . to select the picture from the context menu . to select the cross in the window top on the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ v@@ ray ; work , you need to read the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; but the documentation of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then you will be displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire / page@@ views .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously at the same time . however , not the sub@@ property has been selected to the object , as all the objects are selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object in the object tree , select the location which you want to add the object , click the icon in the tool window or select a menu item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several positions , the following recording menu will be built , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
deprecated : function ereg _ replace ( ) is deprecated in / www / htdocs / w00cec0c / webEdition / we / include / we _ modules / object / we _ listview _ multiobject.class.php on line 296
&quot; if you have changed properties , please click here to take this changes . if you want invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the layout dialog , you can enter the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the object with help . &quot;
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature .
&quot; if you edit a text or part of a text or part of a text , you can view a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a part of the text box and a small example of the scene will be selected , even if you want to have a part of the text . if you only have a part of the text you want to have a text in a text map , and not the entire text map ) , cross the text . &quot;
the screen shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and thus to change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; if a transformation will be chosen , the control points and it will be displayed a small cross in the wire model . &quot;
&quot; each object has a view of a visual level . you can only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level , or equal in the tool level of the scene . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ int@@ ext ; has a window setting as the default setting . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed , and the four graphical views on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t like any other arrangement , you can need any other arrangement , you can save several window items and simply select between various angles . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the top of the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
the new view will be anch@@ ored on the right or left @-@ hand side . the new view will be anch@@ ored on the right or left @-@ hand side of this view .
&quot; if you want to arrange several views on each other , you will be able to change the same place on another view . you can change between the views through click on the map sheet . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window of the views are reserved . views , which are not in the main window . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click the small cross in the beginn@@ ings . to prevent the small square between the arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can paste additional page@@ views in the main window . in the menu , you can find entries for each type of views . new page@@ views are reserved , you can watch them at any place . &quot;
the current window view can save you with view window . it will be displayed in the window to save the window under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program must be installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ int@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the icon of the icon of the icon window or select the menu entry . &quot;
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the Ren@@ der@@ . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels .
&quot; when you click on the icon The Sun , click on the icon of the button , or in the menu of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that can see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card card size , you can select the width and height of the picture . if you want to choose a small area of the image , select the section section and enter the image section for ren@@ ders . &quot;
a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in a model with complex diff@@ user Ref@@ .-No. . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features you can find in the user manual book &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; these pictures have often used a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ patterns or side effects in curves and lines , sometimes sometimes details are not displayed when they are in the display of smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these error . in general , pictures with this feature is better . &quot;
&quot; if you play Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing , will be charged and connects to Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a Stra@@ Ã e pixel . this technique is super @-@ cooled . &quot;
&quot; the second method is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is always further split by the calculations and adap@@ tive to the calculations . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray have been calculated using the given threshold of a certain number of pixels using the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels . if you use the depth of a certain additional number of pixels . if you use the depth of a certain additional number of pixels . if you use the depth of a certain additional number of pixels . if you can use the depth of a certain additional number of pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; when the difference between the colour changes , the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ class , the pixel can be divided into 4 sub@@ folder which can be divided into 4 sub@@ directories . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to increase the Ali@@ asing effect is the generation of space for the Stra@@ hl process , called J@@ abl@@ ing . if you &apos;re J@@ aw@@ ing , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern . &quot;
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is a experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refl@@ ections . it takes very long to leave a scene with this property .
&quot; on this card card you can select whether the Alpha channels will be charged by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the corresponding rays are no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console @-@ output . when &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu entry file ... and select the dialog window . &quot;

&quot; if you do not support the source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ and@@ he ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ w and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ end . &quot;
&quot; to export objects from the object tree into the editor , select the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object in the editor . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ int@@ er ; a scene ren@@ amed . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the Property View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ad@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the object . make sure you are in the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ bib@@ lical data , you have to register the path to these files here . if a file in different paths of the library is used , the first used file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected inspection points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type .
you can specify the property of the points on the Ra@@ ster in the context menu of the wire model .
&quot; for some objects such as the ball , the ball can be set up for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you view larger projection views , all the wire model views will be higher than the camera . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with excep@@ tions of the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this feature is a better approach for proj@@ ections , but more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
the wall is displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors .
&quot; if you see the ground floor , a floor below the objects are shown below the objects . the floor will be displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you specify the edge of the use , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ ases method is used for the ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set to the parameters in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in the section window , you can use existing window items or new window items . in the section window will be explained , how you can create window and save . &quot;
the combination of standard equipment : shows all the existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ int@@ er ; uses the selected window of the program .
the list prec@@ au@@ tions shows all existing window manufacturers . a new arrangement can be configured with the button and select a selected arrangement with the button remove .
each window will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
the list below shows all page@@ views for the selected window . new page@@ views can be added to the button and select the selected file with the button remove .
&quot; the position of the new F@@ enst@@ ers . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with the window card , you will receive a card card with the v@@ ori@@ on view , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; you have just click &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ad@@ ness ; installed and now you would like to follow the ultimate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should not create the ultimate but easy scene of very popular : a ball on a level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you find the result only a black screen . if you use a 3D programme , you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you have no camera set , no rules for the ren@@ ders are used as a result , you will receive a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add light sources , your entire scene in the dark and you will get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all the error , you will see when the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ad@@ dit@@ ch ; the following window shows : &quot;
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool . read the documentation that you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will be able to use these menus and symbols , so you should use the menus and symbols , and also their application . &quot;
&quot; select all objects from the object , you need to remove all objects from the object tree . &quot;
&quot; the wire model displays the whole scene , which you create . especially in the fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
the object tree contains a new entry with the name of the camera . if it click on the contents of view product properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation of the camera . in the user documentation and Po@@ v@@ ray ; you can find further details .
&quot; you can change anything on the fundamental settings of the camera , this is later instructions but note that the camera in view control points you can change the camera in the view of the camera . click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you exit the button or select the box , the wire model views and the object tree immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the sight of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might be able to create a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ tion body ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a typical method for the solution of this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ad@@ mi@@ er ; offers a simple option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor : &quot;
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree is displayed the new name immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model displays now also the plane , if even in the moment only as a limited final level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level until the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will find the basic options for each new object : scale , turning and restart . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only that you get some of these parameters . select the shift and make the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; select the bottom of the floor to set its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose from different materials . &quot;
in both cases a dialog box will be displayed in which you can select how the object will be displayed in the object tree . please choose the name in the property tab ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) with a click on the button you can see how the pig@@ ment is now .
&quot; of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ment is only a matte black material because you need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the preview . &quot;
&quot; if you do not see any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you want to ren@@ ame your picture now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results : &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about this entry , you can also read this entry twice ( you can also read this entry twice ( you can also learn more frequently but the chess board can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
select in the object tree table times and change the colours in view of the object properties :
&quot; however , the ball is just like the bottom of the floor : the ball is just as simple as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can change the settings . set the value for radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the ball with the bottom . otherwise the ball is over the ground , since you have moved the ground to be moved to below . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ ders now is a strange result : as already before , the ball surface is as a matte black material . set in the following step in a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now have a material . as already in the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First name and change the name for example in the ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , select the colours and select the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve an interesting effects when you take the time , some of the finish features : &quot;
&quot; change the values like in the following screen , click on the Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; the settings of shine effect and reflection , even partially good visual effects , perfectly suitable for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if you are not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of which possibilities you have to have a good impression of which possibilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ad@@ ness ; . hopefully , you have already learned that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends data to all the current scripts . this reason , scripts are written to the default settings of the scrip@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if a script started , Amar@@ ok the working folders must be stored on the folder where all data will be saved . &quot;
the script could now be played with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
the volume flow rate is an int@@ oler@@ ance of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .

&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the description of request in the Regist@@ ered CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
read the read and - if a en@@ coder in the tab card code has been configured in the inser@@ tion settings .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available En@@ coder so that the selection can be read with another En@@ coder . it is possible that before the En@@ coder can be configured in the Settings dialog .
opens the file manager so that one already selected file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; .
open dialog box to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( like prot@@ ocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( how to read the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main feature dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; with different cart@@ on maps ( such as En@@ coder , to access the En@@ coders ) . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ efficient and compression rates and helps you in the choice of the correct code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio is lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there is also other such as &apos; sh@@ ek@@ &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; therefore , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a light advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality with lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important , since both co@@ di@@ fication is very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will be delivered with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions ? &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG display equipment is present .
&quot; MP3 , when music also belongs to other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo plants . today , it is only the MP3 format . &quot;
&quot; a short list of parameters with parameters for audio quality and , the pres@@ sur@@ ge rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) : &quot;
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting result is good transparency for most people and most of music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should offer usually for most people and most musical pieces acceptable transparency , and has already high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo plants with high quality . &quot;
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo plants with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . need to 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stere@@ otypes with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ els . good Gen@@ ug for music of teen@@ agers , portable devices and car installations . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos;@@ = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be able for most people and most environments , but if you want to have the highest quality , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB on the internet , are available in the program available as a list of parameters . you can set / used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code , there are often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters . the manual or the help to explain the code for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the sample ( English : day ) , add to MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt _ title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in the people the audio CDs are read , so that all other information can be sent to the host . it is possible that all other information can be taken into the computer that is only from text : &amp; CD ; title , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less value , it is not allowed to prevent it from the &amp; CD ; and also the information without the &amp; CD ; and also the information without the &amp; CD ; and this is the information without the &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; for the use of free@@ DB can be used to select ( S@@ ays of a address ) . in this type of configuration , the email address will be used in this type of configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; for use of free@@ DB , it will be used for use of free@@ DB . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org is a current list of mir@@ acles for the online registration of &amp; CD ; it can be downloaded during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database file or ( usually monthly monthly ) only the topic@@ ality of the database .
which release program is used to save pieces from &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; it &apos;s hard to get to cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , who want to know exactly in the source code .... This was always the best choice for the read of audio CD ; it &apos;s always the best choice for the read of audio CD ; it &apos;s always the best choice for the read of audio CD . &quot;
&quot; to Save WAV files , the code can be selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver Package must be installed in the chapter . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined code .
&quot; after installation of a code , more information about his switch can be obtained by the input of command as l@@ ame file or l@@ ame --@@ help to be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can be installed in a terminal with a command line of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to share both programs with a command line in a terminal . &quot;
check whether you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the cover of the &amp; CD ;
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can be done as you have to go . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , everything else is to do ? now , yes , no problem , follow this step for step example , and you will find enough information to make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for first time , everything and our first &amp; CD ; read the l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in the average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have read writing ( cover ; by you try to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or to copy .
&quot; the first section shows the basic introduc@@ tions of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , something which is probably just once done , and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; , which must be established for each other &amp; CD ; it must be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here , we determine the use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings , we will be able to change it very probably not to read a &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device will be connected to the out@@ readable programme that the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , it can also be used as a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , it can also be used as a &amp; CD ; / DVD player can also be configured with other programs for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
only for in@@ complete information you will be informed if you will be informed if you are informed if the information is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a free@@ DB calcul@@ ator .
&quot; note : the computer must be connected during the read of &amp; CD ; with the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry was found on the read of the &amp; CD ; it &apos;s been modified to be changed by the database name and file name , they can be changed easily with the database name and the ID@@ 3 tags and the ID@@ 3 tags with bf@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , if you want to enter anything manually , if you want to choose all manually , if you want to download the database and free@@ DB . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . this are settings for the data @-@ request , for the call of &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server to the Internet . read the section about free@@ DB . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want only to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look after a mirror server in your proximity .
&quot; both the server concerns , since but many Fire@@ flies the protocol 88@@ 80 default graph , perhaps there is a lot of luck with the protocol of 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . &quot;
take the settings from the screen picture . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer )
&quot; at the same time at the same time , there is a reason why more than one of the same player ? parallel reading reading and code ? the author white it is not so easy to try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ specific folder for temporary files : if you are stored this ank@@ ind , then the path must be stored in the private folder . this can be useful if you want to create a WAV files to WAV files . &quot;
&quot; the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , the command is somewhat long , under the right of the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defined the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stere@@ ograms . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the conversion of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; id@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags you can also be deleted for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of tags and the output input ( including the full path ) and the output input ( including the full path ) .
set the rest like in the screen picture . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; at the same time at the same time , WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ Core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we have chosen the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; finished . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section will be described as the process of the release of the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , the type like the music on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; using the free@@ DB , which is not yet listed in free@@ DB . so you will learn the &amp; CD ; with successfully by free@@ DB ab@@ out@@ dated data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; with successfully by free@@ DB . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to find it . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the car .
&quot; if this does not happen , the &amp; CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window will be listed as in the screen picture . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia could be read . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , you are looking for questions and answers to the help or go back to the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully performed by the free@@ DB , all the title of the pieces are already filled and also the name of the artist and album . &quot;
&quot; for the case that it is more than a entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window built , and you can select the database entry , which is the best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have the cross field for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually switch manually through the choice of the first buttons in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you need to have the access to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the Tit@@ els of the first piece

&quot; attention european and german buyers : we allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; the lower comments folder can be used for the individual comments , di@@ gesti@@ ble per piece , the commentary field of the album is used for comments for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful termination of the data from the free@@ DB is the CD editor , but it also contains a good idea to check the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD file or not ... ) but also to check whether there are any unwanted opinions . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we do not use ID@@ 3@@ xxx tags . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the files later with the day editor . however , 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him , you can also create id@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
Tags will not be supported by all code or file formats .
&quot; for more information , please visit www.@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Rap for example are available at rock . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the CD Edi@@ tors will be again and you see that the fields marked for the album has already heard , which we have for the first piece . enter the title of the piece on each case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and procedure you have given the same way to you all the title map of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not to download the data from the free@@ DB .
it is the third button of the tool . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that all pieces are selected to select the line , select the selection of the piece . only the title will be selected to select the selection of the piece , or select the button to select all the pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces . &quot;
&quot; this window was started by clicking on the button selection of the readable process , this window appears on OK , and then we will be able to take a look at the window with the support and follow what . &quot;
click the tab on tab on the order window . it is in the left corner of the window directly under the buttons of the tool .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is displayed on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the F@@ enst@@ ers in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ ver which you don &apos;t have installed . pieces that are not successfully checked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
now it is clear that the error occurs directly after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the mission 1 reads the first piece of , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the code of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , the status quo in the lower part of the F@@ enst@@ ers , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration option to press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able to read this behavior .
&quot; now the last title will be read , while another piece is formed and a dr@@ ink@@ est order at the Wart@@ rol is a small window with a message for a short time in the upper part of the F@@ enst@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , you need to create an audio files as MP3 or OGG . if you want to create audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in C@@ VS as part of the k@@ de@@ &apos; package , you can download a anony@@ me copy . &quot;
this section is subject to persons who use the source files to use and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help with the program your needs to be adjusted when it runs , it is the following correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program allows many different programs , many variations of settings , has many variants of settings . at the best you read the step for step example to learn the options and settings . it shows the photos of different types of settings , settings , and also comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , always at the same time ? even if only the help of the program can be found , without any permission of the program , no audio CD ; in the drive , or from the unusual menu ? &quot;

&quot; supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( Li@@ eder@@ ike , or Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ ners ) . K@@ Mid is automatically used . &quot;
&quot; when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the next time , K@@ Mid at the next time again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ izer , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for example you need the L@@ up -@@ driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select the menu from the menu . it appears the usual file dialog with its help to select the song . &quot;
you can also use a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows can be seen with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and select the button in the tool , select the entry from the menu unit or select the empty . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you are added to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces are added to a collection and then add another one . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can use an any place by clicking the middle of mouse button and drive away . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can change the arrows left and right of Tem@@ po@@ ad , click the original pace , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; when a piece is played , a pressure on a button is played on a button or the menu of the menu item will be played on the menu item , and the image entry is played with a print on the button , will be released &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ les can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ ess and again other both pieces . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust the events to change the events , and even better : the event will be automatically deleted that you want to change anything manually . if you want to change the entry in the menu Settings menu , you will be able to change this . if you want to see the other way you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event , select from the menu settings , the entries are also the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you created together .
&quot; to open a collection , please open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point of organis@@ er .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copy and then the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original songs .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the part in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when the application is not stored , this collection will not be saved . concerns you , if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected to the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of the automatic setup .
&quot; when automation is activated , a piece can be added to the opening ( under use of file or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic collection is activated , when opening a piece of the temporary collection is activated and gel@@ e@@ ert . this collection will then be added to the open pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , the collection and the desired song and then click here . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order to select where the songs are played , when you played the series after the sub@@ menu of the menus , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove songs or random order in the menu , the order will be defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the Coll@@ ect manager or use the selection list of the Kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to show a song to jump , select the button next to the menu next to the menu item , or press the button on the right . &quot;
&quot; to get a song back to jump , select the button to select the previous piece , or press the button on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection and click on the button . &quot;
the temporary collection may not be deleted .
&quot; this is not necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izer , which are not General MIDI MIDI . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in Events were found in the syn@@ thes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map containing all events of the type Change to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always a trumpet is playing when originally a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you have only a Sound@@ card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ ATI@@ BEL is ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . you have to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite se@@ di@@ tor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that sets all necessary alter@@ ations for the playing of a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP -@@ section , which may appear as follows . a prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ites is that each layer has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you see that a section is used to show that a section begins ( except for Options ) and that the end of a Ab@@ schnitt@@ es is achieved .
please send me your Map File as E @-@ Mail so that I can offer you in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general MIDI MIDI .
&quot; in this section , the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard will be used as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the par@@ atro@@ op is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all tones that need this instrument , on the sound with the number M ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the sound . &quot;
&quot; if now , a MIDI file is a note with patch 127 ( threaded ) , it &apos;s patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file is . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; drum &quot; &quot; patch is a different Per@@ cep@@ sion@@ sin@@ sin@@ us ( drum , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that sound the sound height of the always same drum means ( like him a key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how tones on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section , the order of lines is very important as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define each channel and every instrument of multiple Key@@ maps . you have to use only in the first line of different names .
key@@ maps are used primarily used to form the sounds on the performer channel . look for example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels to other channels . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel you will make the quite easy in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the performer to a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built in the following samples : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined in the channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined in the file name for this channel . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to use the Per@@ k@@ ean patch on the performer channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio gives you the value of P@@ itch @-@ B@@ ender events in which the value of 40@@ 96 is used , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only a value of 40@@ 96 will be used in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used as GM is that a keyboard , which will play a P@@ itch event , with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards to play two tones up to a oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu at Settings , point MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole number of pian@@ ist ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to view the played sounds . view the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed is played , the speed is played with a song . each higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song to follow a song to follow the text , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file , which contains information about how a music piece is played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that can be the same MIDI file to two different devices as well as two different musicians the same scores can play with very different results . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file doesn &apos;t provide a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over all . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you need a binary distribution ( s , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support . &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; set the folder where you want to add &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
activate the setting of the temporary collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can click the arrow button on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD display to slow down playback . the standard of the standard is to double click on the LCD double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have been open to a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Working area , a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want a Kar@@ aoke file ) or maybe a file would like to change the collection of &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window , and select the desired file in the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a file you want to add a file , without it to a collection , switch the setting of the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ H . &quot;
then you can also use B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and a collection with all three files . how do you make this ?
&quot; these people have to me MIDI files or text sent to me ! if I hear this songs , or the post card , I don &apos;t see it , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; for programming . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you want to download a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , please send me a email : &quot;
&quot; if you want to send a telephone card or a MI@@ DI@@ P / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will send a mail to friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send a MIDI file , you should have a MIDI file . &quot;

&quot; of course you can add groups to group , to get an additional Hier@@ arch@@ ers , his group and all its sub@@ groups are cop@@ ied to the current category and the playback starts with the shared entry . &quot;
&quot; you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player will be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files , but also by the application itself , but also by the application itself , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected and either the processing mode will be chosen and either the processing mode will be selected or another category will be selected . &quot;
all changes are lost when the processing mode or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .

&quot; currently only a plugin is available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; added . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bug@@ gers for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bug@@ ger plugins in the project settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; User Interface : &quot;

&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger is to begin with the execution of scripts and information about the monitoring variables , as well as the current line , the execution of the script will be started . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger has been given to begin with the execution of the script , without information to monitoring variables and the current drawing number . if this happens , the execution is further , the execution , once a requirement is set . &quot;
the de@@ bug@@ ger leads to the next statement in the script without the functions of the functions .
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include files of the error . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bug@@ ger has to go to the statement , and to go to the next so that there was not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression may be monitored , the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be given a variable or a new value of a variable .

&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and de@@ arly , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use other users a better viewing and more information in work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain the definition of many tags , but it can be nothing . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using the use &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
the name of the basic class is valid for this class . ( only family 2 )
&quot; the name of the class is valid , where this method is heard . ( only family 2 ) &quot;
&quot; if yes , the day a common attribute group and attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
a text in dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day . this is a only element type element .
this element can be added to each attribute . it is the name and the type of the Attributes . additionally it contains additional tags to describe how this attribute will be displayed and etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code for the attributes for the attributes in the tag field dialog and attribute @-@ tree in the attribute
requires source = d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to determine the data source of data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting @-@ up and a method@@ ological name . the arguments that can be transferred to the method . can be empty or % of name % , this means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container @-@ day the elements of a list together . it can only occur for a attribute value only once . it is a only element type element .
this day may be empty . this day may be empty for each attribute ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . this element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialog . this day should be empty ( e.g. a for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .

&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider index.html file in any text editor . &quot;
&quot; this should be done by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tips &gt; , and lt ; and especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tips &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this is not the leg of the work , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools will appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check the X@@ ML@@ . to select a further dialogue that is easy to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the filename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic .
&quot; in the following an example for a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . &quot;
&quot; PHP = &quot; &quot; PHP version = &quot; &quot; PHP version = &quot; &quot; PHP &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; PHP &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; PHP &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; PHP &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot;

a action can set up with settings actions ... created . click new action to the same dialog :
the button can be assigned to the button button . using the button the button can be assigned to the button .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be added to the detailed settings and the execution of the action will be added in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful shar@@ p . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually script , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use the document ( or parts of the document ) . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start -@@ dialog for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; as first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter will be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified personnel are allowed , it is recommended to use the following places : global scrip@@ t@@ folders : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / viewer in its path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special versions that can be used in the command line : $ PAT@@ H There are other special versions that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we are replaced with the URL of current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script is used .
the parameter for this event is usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script listing of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is to be able to send the standard input to the standard input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , based on the default output . it may be given to the standard edition , which will be set to the standard edition . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the same language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . &quot;
&quot; once a work@@ piece is added , you need to add actions and configure the settings . &quot;
the parts of this thread are quite independent . press release date to the bottom end of the F@@ enst@@ ers starts the Edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes , and you are planning to use dialog &quot; Day &quot; , &quot; if available , this entry is possible at the end of the action . &quot;
you should be able to replace the action in connection with this icon ? replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better , we will be able to use it . select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics , other programs ( or where otherwise it is located in its distribution room ) . &quot;
&quot; by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that this is not only for you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol it must be associated with the action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is , select it from and confirm having OK . &quot;
&quot; press button and set them with other tags , so that there are , or confirm having to complete it with OK . &quot;
&quot; you want to remove some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool slide , or it should be divided into multiple groups . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the Tr@@ enner ( on top right ) for my work@@ piece . according to the selection of the element you should be added to the tool , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds to the element to the tool . &quot;
I would like to add a quick option to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will be able to add it and to add the tool .
&quot; please note how the Tr@@ enner the group support . one who knows my tool , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool slide must be tested by the sample of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be used to be stored in the correct folder . please enter your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your work@@ piece ( n ) will be loaded ( n ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; the most important feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation to the script language or the form@@ atting language , which you like to make a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you may check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check whether someone has done for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ er@@ ection / script / etc ; language . then , you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;

the section tree is defined the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; check the # before G@@ etting Started and Language File . this shows that it is a sub@@ folder of the tree with its own content . there is no well known limit for the chess depth ( except by the default ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out . &quot;
&quot; note that the contents can be found directly on a file , ( and consistent in the upper end of the construction site &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; signs you should be replaced , and lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ file files are replaced . &quot;
&quot; this section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which can be displayed in the context of the context of context . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; now you can select your file do@@ cr@@ c simply , and to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( so how to use this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder like do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , please send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it &apos;s possible to share the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tools , scripts , templates ) with other parts . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent to different places , as D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool box of files and folders in the context menu of files and folders in the script menu . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be downloaded in our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users are checked and only available when our team has been used as correct and used for the publication . this is the origin of resources , both for our team as well as for the later user . &quot;
&quot; when high @-@ loading , you will have to be stored after their passive G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have to have multiple keys ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and click OK . &quot;
&quot; to upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tools , work@@ manship , and the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the warning messages are carefully observed . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , it appears to be a case with the applic@@ ant of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to convert XML @-@ languages , which is currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is necessary to work independently because hundreds of day files in the XML format is necessary . it gives the easy way to convert a D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD Download and convert a D@@ TD page , select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description . &quot;
target Version : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written by this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P according to transformation : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; following the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this , and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this chapter tries to make them exactly this concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project management . this means a series of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for any , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available in the common structure of the administr@@ ators , actions and patterns in global tree , which are available in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements make a personal collection of web development , for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific design and work@@ manship . local items are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available within a certain project . this can be done within a certain project . this can be done within a certain project . this is the most restricted size . all elements are made in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main sections : the editing pane , the construction site and the tool . &quot;
&quot; you can click the map with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , as well as the current , other or all cart@@ ons , newly loaded , delete or loading of C@@ VS commands to current document . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ dating CSS Style Sheets If you want to add a document html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to add image slider . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edi@@ tors are shown at the top end of the Edi@@ tors . at present , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; Total access to the new functions and associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ pieces is really easy . if they want to add the same day , for example , then click the icon to fill this day , then click the icon to fill in a dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the project views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate to the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate to the information , sample page , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
this view shows all files in the project and allows the administrator of files in the project using the right mouse click .
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole site &amp; etc ; It will be open to you all options . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; operating range . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available downloads available in Global , Lok@@ al and project works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can edit the available information on a script . &quot;
this view shows the internal structure of the active document .
&quot; this tree appears under the other construction views . with him , man@@ tle attributes and name spaces change the contents of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the full documentation for web technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ loaded documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ons at the lower end of the F@@ enst@@ ers , about the user can be achieved : the news window and the problem . &quot;
&quot; for example , e.g. the D@@ TD &apos;s current document and all changes to D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider index.html file in any text editor . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a work@@ station with E@@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool is designed as a compressed T@@ ar archive about &amp; k@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for example , auto@@ conf allows you to get a number of options that will be able to give a complete list of all options to get a complete list of all options . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when you are problems when you have problems when you have a folder , you should check whether your path will be &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before their bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; - editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able Web Language Editor ? now , this would have done it to the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done it . &quot;
&quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now you can define the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; developers , in good use of free software , the idea of the development of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developers , in good use of free software , the idea of the development of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developers , in good use of free software , the idea of the development , and to expand users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web development to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can be seen the productivity of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and verwandte languages .
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL , and produced a commercial program . &quot;

this is the folder where the tool is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to add files of the local file system in the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great , if you want to download and change it . if you want to download and change the script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) must be different . &quot;

&quot; the password will keep in the core memory and at program . this option is useful when frequent changes of files , and the more un@@ safe password on the plate is not in question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you want to change your opinion .

this is the name of the server to be cop@@ ied to the files . either a full qualified domain name or a IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer reserves for the high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot;

&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool box . it can be loaded in a project of many views , i.e. by simple di@@ ets the view can be loaded and replace the current files and work@@ stations . &quot;
&quot; page@@ views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool , can be opened on settings . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps to increase the productivity by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; as already mentioned above the tool can be used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the best via the menu tool can be used below the section of tool box below . &quot;
&quot; the tool can be set by means of context menu ( right click on the tool ) , the tool can be set by clicking on the tool . &quot;
&quot; through the context of the context of a action ( symbol ) on a tool slide , additionally the entries can be removed and action will be displayed at the same time . &quot;
the tool and the actions to them can be set to them in the menu with the settings of the settings ... and settings actions .
&quot; you can copy , move or delete files to the existing file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any other file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can paste it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you need to be used for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; available templates have been used for their application . please read the at the beginning of each template .
&quot; Bin@@ ary is all what does not mean text is . it may be added to text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; s ,
&quot; for example , you can create new documents for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders under global templates . see below for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area can be added to a complete menu system that can be added to a complete menu system on desktop or Perl . &quot;
&quot; how the name says , for all websites as templates . you are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; make a document structure to create ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select a template for a local template . &quot;
&quot; as soon as it is done , you can see that ( even if there was a project template ) the template is visible in the project . &quot;
choose text in your document and click Save as a local / project template .
the creation of bin@@ ocular templates is simply : the file can be used only in a pre @-@ run folder . it can be used to use all file management functions as well as a copy or paste via the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
&quot; you can select in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure text by default , but of course , it can be used as local or global text . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the project page , you can use head@@ lines and foot@@ steps or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; create files or with them together . additionally , you can enjoy some things at the use of templates in projects very deep in the eye . &quot;
the window structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / ... and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / upload / Qu@@ anta / share / No of this file corresponds to a of four types of container as above .
&quot; in order to select the behaviour of a folder with the right mouse button on the folder and in context menu properties , select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously mentioned types ; files , text or templates . this selection is broken , as soon as el@@ ter@@ restrial attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , it would be possible to disable it in this path , except in the case of a normal folder would appear in the case of a normal folder . if nothing appears , it is probably in a case folder . &quot;
&quot; using a folder or foot@@ line for templates in this folder , this could be used for a certain project . this could be the general head@@ lines or foot@@ steps for all templates for a certain project and allows for all templates for a certain project and allows for all templates for a certain project . &quot;
&quot; in addition to context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) on a complete command menu for adding folders or copy and paste the templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which are accessible by the V@@ PL ; editor and the two parts of the editing pane in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and edit the source code editor , which are shown in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is to edit a document , the &amp; PHP ; is it not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL . it is not possible to change this directly with the V@@ PL . there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode will work exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes in the source editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor functions and the cur@@ sor in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ editor syn@@ ch@@ ron runs the active cur@@ sor from one window to others , where the position is re@@ tained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via the settings of V@@ PL ; -@@ view , one can be set between vertical and a click or automatically . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change the title of the website , you will be able to select the title of the website , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; this can be used as a new document with the V@@ PL ; it is used to change the following : &quot;
Met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two circuits below or removed a click on the column name and key password 2 on the contents -@@ column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of the design of the pages of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules using the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS Gallery template by clicking on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is like in a text processing .
&quot; in the same way , the inser@@ tion of tags will not be removed in the same manner as in the source code editor , e.g. in the source code editor , if a anchor tag must be removed with text , each other surrounding the anchor @-@ day will be removed . &quot;
some work@@ stations are disabled like the tables manager or the lists are disabled . they will be de@@ activated later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used for tables or lists tool .
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of Stil@@ ls . in the difference to other programs for Stil@@ ls , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style . &quot;

&quot; there are lots of graphical tools available . why so , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written . &quot;
&quot; the guide was very complicated because one of the most tragic changes , and at the same time at the same time , the result was changed in the same file . &quot;
&quot; that of me use program showed me only the changed lines , I could not see what exactly exactly within these lines . &quot;
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be a differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , each lot of other useful functions added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare list , you want to compare it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function of a lot of work was made , the design and collapse of folders . this function is related and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when two persons can work independently from one piece . this is useful if two persons can work independently from one piece of each piece . in this Editor you can see the result of the differences between the differences between the differences between the differences between the differences between the differences between the differences between the differences between the differences . in this Editor you can also edit the result . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exotic differences between the possibilities of the possibilities we need to check this function . if you need to check it , you &apos;ll be able to check this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tobacco are visible . if you are only in a certain number of white characters , you can see the summary of the column in the column on the left . &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , the color of which file is different . red color means that both files may differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files may have the same name , but in different folders , you can edit the Ti@@ pp@@ work by using only the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; folder 1 folder , 1 folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folders , folders , folders , folders , folders , folders , folders , folders , press folder &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual of the file name , select the selection of the file name ( file ... ) or use a last open file from the recording list . if you need to add the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder where you select a folder where you select a folder where you select a file , for B and C but a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not necessary for the target . it is not necessarily necessary to do an output input for the target . it is not necessary to do this step even during storage . &quot;
the inser@@ tion button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set the options before you start using the version .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
you can also use a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and leave him via a comparison window .
&quot; if you want to figure out a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out a relatively large effort , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
note : there can be nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; otherwise it is supported by text in a comparison window .
warning : some editors are interpreted and add text in another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the character number of the first visible line in the window . &quot;
&quot; the three source code are the letters A , B and C . A has the colour blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees itself at the color , which is the pre @-@ defined colour of red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful if you are three files . this is especially useful if you are three files . this is in the next section ( collapse ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text , the column displays the corresponding color to the text . if white characters are not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters only in character and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individuals . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which is generated by the text , where the respective source file has no lines . if the time is activated , the line is generated to broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison of the comparison ) also a Info line with the wor@@ ding issue : , the file name and &#91; edit &#93; if you have the result . usually it is possible by the automatic setup , but often it is also conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! ! ! ! !
&quot; if only two numbers are used , each difference is solved soon at the same time . &quot;
&quot; with a click on the left mouse button in a window , the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is only a space for the case that you can change your opinion , and perhaps another source . this is only a space for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps another source . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; trial period , however , however , in the interim , if you have to copy a text from the result list . go with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if at the time of the sources the options numbers , or Ig@@ nor@@ ance C / C + + comments are activated , are changes in numbers or comment@@ aries as a white sign . &quot;
&quot; in one of the window , you can use the keyboard and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the window , you can also use the keyboard . &quot;
you can also use the other keys to Edit . using the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ load mode .
a click on the left mouse button is synchron@@ ized the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section on the section of the respective group ) .
&quot; the tool box contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can see the current / first / last difference , to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( C@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) , to the next / v@@ ori@@ gen conflict ( C@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) , to the next / v@@ ori@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; if this enabled , you need to copy the copy -@@ button ( C@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ tion ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . : &quot;
the options and the list of the last files will be added to the next start . ( menu setup - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also works with variable width to selection , you should not use this but not . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sor font . if the chosen font is not supported , it happens nothing . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , it will be inserted into the table button the respective number of spaces . otherwise , a table characters is defined . &quot;
&quot; if you want to press or return or return , the final line automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be cop@@ ied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which type type you prefer . the pre @-@ set value is the general value of the operating system .
the second step is ignored . the second step is ignored . the second step is ignored . the second step is ignored . the second step is ignored . the second step is ignored .
&quot; in the end of a row , some editors may be visible on the end of a row , but then you could save files with different sizes on the side of a row , but then you could save files with different sizes in the page @-@ page compared to other systems . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) is ignored . in the result the differences are shown , but they will be treated as a white sign . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comment@@ aries are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic mode mode , this setting will be displayed as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next day before the next day . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if you need JavaScript / B / C for all you need , then use the functions of a / B / C for all all you need . if you need this only from time to time , you can use the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comment@@ aries , if the options dialog box or Ig@@ nor@@ ance C / C + + -@@ testim@@ onials are activated . &quot;
&quot; these options are treated in the chapter to scanning and make a separate guide . look for details on documentation for the directory , comparison , and meeting . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already have an older version , the original version will be added to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original . if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ;
the following code is enabled for any entry separately . if you enabled this option to use this option will be used for all entries .
( this may not be changed and has been changed here and has been very informative . )
download the file @-@ code for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted as the co@@ hes@@ ion for each file can be compared with different co@@ hes@@ ion .
&quot; if you have a file , you can specify it , which should be used for storage . &quot;
&quot; if you define the processing command , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files 16 @-@ Bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command may only be with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the code of the output command . &quot;
notice : this also applies to alter@@ ations of changes in figures or comment@@ aries when the options dialog box or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + -@@ testim@@ onials are activated . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you are three files . in the normal mode , all differences are shown in a colour@@ ing figure column . but sometimes you would like to see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen so that you simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful in the window . this can also be useful for the ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you are able to run the differences and decide on the current file , then if you are able to start just two files . a simple click , then start the file name for the output file , then the name of the last source file will be re@@ used to start the name of the last source file . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is visible to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the issue of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is given to this external command . if the output of the command is specified ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is specified ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is specified . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility at the Di@@ ff results . however , a external program is needed , and most users do not need for yourself . the good news is however that in most cases or per@@ l . &quot;

&quot; while you have experim@@ enting , start to understand it , and perhaps you may even get this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ate of figures is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ user . however , it &apos;s good as an example for a further pre@@ order command line for the time period of the time . &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 678@@ 9 &#93; / / g &apos; each of the characters between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and each of hits will be replaced by nothing to be deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you would like to add multiple effects on once . then , you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &quot;
&quot; you can also use Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery options . &quot;
&quot; after the normal pre@@ processor , the data according to the normal pre@@ processor , for the ad and to guide us . the further operations can change the data provided by the time @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , one sees the number of the normal pre@@ processor the issue of the normal pre@@ processor . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but how in any function , text changes or differences , you may need specific differences in the worst case of time . &quot;
often you need to add a folder in a folder of files . from this reason you can compare &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ transm@@ its .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start , &quot;
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ations and displays the simulated changes without them ?
... with selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 button )
this is the tool and setup of each files . you have to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog box .
&quot; if there are three folders , then folder 1 as base . if no target folder was used , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
please note that only the comparison of folder will automatically send you to start the corresponding menu entry or the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
&quot; during the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you have listed the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed below . &quot;
&quot; when the scanning of the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder of the scan is found here in a tree . you can select a object with a simple mouse click here .
&quot; select a folder where you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or click the object click on the right / right . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a file , the file will be started and it appears to be a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) again .
&quot; when the data type in the other folders are different , then this is visible in the columns of a / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . if the case will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as in the above image , you will be used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; in case of identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries are different . &quot;
&quot; folder will be considered as identical if you are identical , if you are identical to the same colour . then you have the same color . in folder it is the same color . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this colour scheme is based on the diff . the colors reflected the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow , and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C doesn &apos;t exist if it exists )
... &quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not the same data type ( e.g. a a folder and B a file is ) : error : contradic@@ ted data types . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same data type ( e.g. a a folder and B a file ) : error : contradic@@ ted data types . as long as such incorrect objects may not be started .
&quot; the mode is active if only two folders , and no explicit target folder , and if the option returns are active . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action is identical to that both folder are identical . &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical in both folders and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as a visible file name for the output file only B ; right after the defect &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; if the files are generated and the option of new file will be activated , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date of files are different but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; during the collapse , a file on the other is a file after the other . you have successfully completed a file after the other . you will be successful if the collapse was successful , and according to other messages when the collapse is completed , you should see a last check and see whether the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the dialog dialog full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ ers , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted ) is only displayed when three folders are compared to three folders . &quot;
&quot; you can take either the selected entry ( or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries to once . if you have all the watch actions that have been selected ( also available in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the collapse . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target folder , then will be used in the Three @-@ folder mode C as the target to be chosen and the synchron@@ ization will be used as a target and / or B as destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries are displayed in the target folder . there are some options through the specific entries can be displayed in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; to select the directory : select directory , select directory or press F@@ 7 ( the button name ) . in order to take action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if by means of contradic@@ tions and invalid actions , a message will be able to select the incorrect elements . you can choose to select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you want to carry out all entries , a dialog window with the Options button can simul@@ ate and manipul@@ ate . &quot;
select the language in which this site should be shown
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; leads to certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then opens a collapse window ( note the screen window ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready to start with a file , select Delete images / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next story . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to use the cause of problem , or to solve the problem to other way . &quot;
&quot; if there are several entries in the current session and leads to all entries in the current session , and leads them to the later date of all entries . even if you lead to change action , these entries will be carried out again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory list with these options :
only files that are displayed on the specified pattern can be displayed in the element tree . it can be displayed in the element of element : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ der . it can be displayed in the element name : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not be displayed in the element tree . it can be displayed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ der . it can be displayed in the element name : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; in some file systems , files are marked as a file . this option can decide whether these files may be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; at links on files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared to the links . &quot;
&quot; with links on folder : if the option is activated , the symbolic links will be compared . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ aries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ ocular analysis , and much slower , when they used on files that don &apos;t contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you have big folders about a slow network , it may possibly be faster , only the share of the share and the file size . this is a certain measure of safety . this option is used in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; this option is to be useful when trying to change the date of date . the files are considered as identical if they are large . this can be useful when using the Change of the modified date . please use this option in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders will be compared and no target folder was identical to this mode , the results are identical to be selected as both folders are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the new file is considered as action . ( this is considered to be sure that the other file is not changed , because it will not be changed into any case . ) This option is used in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder , the original version is named and receives the extension .@@ original . &quot;
normally the folders will be visible when you want to move the window into the window . if you don &apos;t want to move the window into the window and exit between the directory and text window between the two page@@ views .
&quot; if you want to save a file , just click the folder menu . &quot;
&quot; this status is lost if you read the directory again : directory - menu : new , read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparent with help from K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders .
the first command line is a local file with a FTP server . the second command line is assigned a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax for local files and folders . a few things should consider :
&quot; a path can be relatively easy . or .. it is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely absolutely . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it may not be distinguished by a link to a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit the change or change date of the original . ( note that this is only for local files . ) ( This is only in local files . ) ( This is only in local files . ) &quot;
the main focus is currently present as a differences @-@ viewer in K@@ ite op . K@@ PD op will always add the built @-@ to @-@ the differences between the differences @-@ viewer and select the right mouse button on the context menu .
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files will exist . if there is a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part , please note that this does not work if any of original files . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the application of two files , a very small tool slide and menu . the collapse or the folders of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the name K@@ diff@@ ers and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ ghtened it ) are already aware that it can lead to the program diff@@ ers from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
&quot; I use GPL programs already very long and I learned to the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who bought this way , or him . &quot;
&quot; you have installed the program from the sources comp@@ iling and the plug @-@ in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find further information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if such a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor is to be used for every difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to design a conflict just through the click , and it is too much effort to design extra an own file format , which can be added to this information . &quot;
the costs of this was previously been too big . you can use a specific version of a source of a source A / B / C . to create larger quantities of text should be used to edit another editor .
&quot; after the length of text is suddenly lt ; No src lin@@ eth ; released and the text can not delete , what means that and how can be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use many colors for the effects of differences . even more her@@ bst would be conf@@ using , and missing the purpose . use it for any other editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
&quot; for information , how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage . &quot;
a list of the last changes will be found under http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ source@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE files are installed in your system , in the K@@ DE installed . if you are un@@ safe , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;

cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or dis@@ old @-@ remove ) cop@@ ied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the selected text . add ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ V or conversion ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position .
&quot; only differences : files are identical in all folders are identical in the folder structure , and thus also not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you must be able to read changes to these options . &quot;
&quot; if the target folder will not be cop@@ ied to the target folder , if the target folder will not be cop@@ ied to the target folder . if the target folder will not be cop@@ ied in a later program version . ) This option is used in a later program version . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selection of the source with the coating A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are already installed on one of the selected window , the lines are already present in the end of the selected group in the end of the selected group in the end of the selected group . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . Under@@ differences in each characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as a differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ atures of all virtual desktop . it is right to see the current programs to see their size , their size to end or them . this works both within one working area as well . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can all virtual desktop surfaces , as well as the current applications . the applications can be selected and even on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle @-@ mouse window , windows can be loaded within a desktop . the movement is possible both within one working area as well as other desktop surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on which the right mouse button is given , the context menu only the two entries and the name of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries of the following : &quot;
&quot; maxim@@ ize the use window on the full size of the desktop . only , when you click on a application . &quot;
please send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only if you click on a application .
&quot; with the middle @-@ button , windows can be moved within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle @-@ mouse button on the desktop and can be moved to other working areas . &quot;
the name of the virtual desktop is displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual desktop .
&quot; the numbers of the virtual desktop computers , the numbers of virtual desktop . is it together with name display , the names with folder , &amp; cover ; 1st floor area . &quot;
&quot; if this field empty , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , the current programs are displayed as small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working surfaces shown to allow her choice . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window will be selected . simply the window shows the window with its default setting and layout map shows a small view of the real program window . re@@ mark : file map is recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ nit@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ Ra@@ ster , as made of P@@ ager applications in some other window management ; wa@@ its quite well , all virtual desktop surfaces in a horizontal and vertical section of which is very good for the representation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . he has changed the advantage that it can be changed into the size that it can be changed into the size , the windows as symbols or with their content . &quot;
click the right mouse button within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and the corresponding exit of the switch point ... can appear in dialog settings .
&quot; at the same time , it can be changed in the dialog settings . &quot;

&quot; unfortunately , you may be able to use your computer without pain to use your computer without pain . &quot;
&quot; in order to see it even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to prevent damage to the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by the mouse . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simply : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitored your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click .
&quot; when the mouse is activated , the mouse button is activated . it is possible to run the mouse only to the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; an mouse click leads to the end of the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports the click on the mouse button . this function is enabled to double click on the left and back , followed by a break , a click on the right mouse button . this function is activated in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delay , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time to the sound system and click the tab . &quot;
this function is marked with &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window facilities please contact the respective documentation to find out there .
&quot; all settings are displayed on the values , which were set at the opening of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the best you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pre @-@ settings . in particular , you should be switched off to the automatic mouse click , you can go later . &quot;
&quot; if you use the command @-@ click , it is necessary to reduce the driver times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : the click on the neutral components of windows or on the browser window that does not have link link , does not want to use the mouse at such places , until they want to use it . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t have to clean the mouse , but also the wheels that come with the mouse sculpture in contact . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to take the mouse box . as it happens , it &apos;s a mouse to mouse . it should be quickly clear when you view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball , you can see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , in which the ball was used . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system could use the version of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use this case , that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not stop through the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a other window manager and a window move .
the solution for this problem is that you use a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can work as usual .

&quot; use the intelligent insert , if you are just start to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; add the mouse button to the other end of the text , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and then again the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; if you use the mouse click , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse clicks will be played a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be installed on most system already . &quot;
the functionality of the hearing mouse is only available if the system is equipped with a Sound@@ card and loud@@ speakers .

filter are one of advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; are not necessary .
it is useful for the improvement of language skills to replace wrong words or short@@ cuts to replace wrong language and speaker or to make particular defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; in order to understand the work of filtration , it is important to know how the program will be working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; there are four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of screen reproduction has the highest priority . you will be read on all other entries , and keeps these orders . &quot;
&quot; war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages as well , but the issue of messages and nor@@ mal@@ em text . these orders are subject to the issue of the warning again . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a long time , you can read with a long text on a web site , you can read with &amp; k@@ icks ; if you are looking for a long text on a web site , you can also see the room . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text messages . each order , you are used by the card of orders , a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example for a applications that have no particular attention . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are used in maintenance periods , with exception of the screen reproduction . if a application the output of a screen reproduction , while you use this issue , this issue is done and expi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filter will never be applied to the issue of screen reproduction , messages and text messages , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
go to the text and enter it on the next filter . at the moment we have three types of fil@@ ing .
&quot; filter are available as modules . in the future , there can be additional types of fil@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; with pre@@ defined character , you can either be used as a words or as regular expressions of a text or as a regular expressions of messages from a text or as a regular expressions of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ gender ) are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; for example , you can read the text of the text or depending on the program that can read the text of the text or depending on the program , you can read text by K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filter has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter does not affect the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text file , a request , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ s , it will be used by all activated filter , which were used on the page below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the normal normal filter . is a filter not used , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be displayed down below the following setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; this pattern can be found in the text , then the text will be found in the text or regular expression as comparative test . &quot;
specify a value for this required field .
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter is given the text with the string in the column , and replaces him in accordance with the character of the column . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can store a list of words or regular file from a file , the entries from the file to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if you click the button to select a list of languages , please click the button to select a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; this is a value added , the filter is only used if the text from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : Kon@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . : &quot;
the character of the string filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions are used with a entry in the Ka@@ sten Di@@ ving filter .
&quot; in comparison of words , the string is used to be limited to the form \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must be limited on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find a guide to the writing of regular stam@@ ina . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; the expressions can be found in the package of Deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ danu@@ bia ) is an W3C standard for such forming . it can only be installed on well @-@ known XML . the help of x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c via the ambient variable PAT@@ H can also be reached . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; for example , you can specify it from a certain speaker , which is set on the card card speaker , or an speakers with certain properties . you can specify that texts of k@@ mail by a female voice will be read . see below . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; an text to the filter , there is a speaker for text . the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that gives the text to the text . &quot;
&quot; this is a value added , the filter does not contain regular expression . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to make the regular expression at the beginning of the drawing , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
specify a value for this required field .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , the management of network interfaces , the routine and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the tool can be used for the installation of a series of system and desktop settings on a single , integrated surface . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ Package has been developed to enable the users to manage the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting by k@@ ebox ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; k@@ ward menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical equipment and their drivers need to be installed and configur@@ able , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device can be installed and the setting of the network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers will be added to the network hardware and other devices at Inst@@ alling &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnished .
the module network settings will be loaded if the network settings will be selected when the module &apos;s network settings will be automatically deleted .
&quot; if the platform will not be detected , the suspension selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release date . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . if all options is shown on the right lower end of the module , you will be able to change the settings by clicking on the right end of the module . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three types : &quot;
&quot; the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed on the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; in the list and click the buttons button in the list and click the buttons button in the list and click the buttons button in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings available . click the button and click the button settings . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are enabled by a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings is required for the system at the start of the system services . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manuals without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration , the TCP / IP address must be given to TCP / IP address . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization doesn &apos;t work is not enabled , this option is not enabled . &quot;
this dialog is displayed in this dialog box as features of the device in the device list .
it should be noted that the IP address is not used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict .
&quot; the network devices can be activated , depending on demand , or off @-@ off network devices . &quot;
&quot; the network devices can be activated , depending on demand , or off @-@ off network devices can be activated via selecting from the list and click on interface . &quot;
the IP address of the computer is designed to remote control the physical connection to remote networks and will be used for TCP / IP communication with computers in other substr@@ ates .
&quot; if the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface is to be selected to the network , in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support is necessary to understand the appropriate IP address .
this list can be added to the name of this list . entries can be added to the list of this list . entries can be added to this list . entries can be added to this list . entries can be added to this list . entries can be added to this list .
&quot; by clicking the buttons ... from the group calcul@@ ator , a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to enter the IP address of your DNS server and then add the button . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
from the group calcul@@ ator you choose a entry and click on the button .... There will be displayed in the dialog tab .
the list of the well @-@ known computer describes the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it will be used in the first line when no DNS server can be used . in small , closed networks can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of the well known computer is some entries , which support &amp; A@@ POS ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click to add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; the name of the known computer , enter the name of the known computer and the button click . if the well @-@ known computer several Ali@@ as names has been added to the name of any alias or the other Ali@@ as names . &quot;
select a entry of the registered computer from the list and select Edit ... The dialog window will be displayed .
&quot; the following tasks are executed , then the list of static Ho@@ sts are updated . &quot;
&quot; in the module network settings , the settings are not immediately available in the system . to activate the changes to activate the changes , in order to activate the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ source@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source content . &quot;
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly full packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s simple to install the package package and in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with such as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ eg or the installation tool for their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for these cases the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and software needs . &quot;
this is only experienced users . it &apos;s not difficult to use &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should be used .
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modified configuration files . &quot;
this section allows the knowledge of IP networks to replace the IP networks . in this revision only basic information about the integration of the PCs in a small ( home - ) Network .
&quot; currently , IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been found in IP@@ v@@ 6 . &quot;
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface .
&quot; in order to avoid a small ( home ) network should be chosen to avoid the IP address in order to avoid compliance with the global ( Internet ) network , the addresses from the table below are not written in the Internet . &quot;
&quot; of course , the access to the Internet for such machines by setting a member . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , most addresses are listed in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is available for networks to 250 users . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net mas@@ ke is usually set up to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computer participants are at the same time . &quot;
the first is the so @-@ called standard route that requires the Lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) .
&quot; the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 has been appointed for the IP Transport in the local own machine . normally , the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 has a own so @-@ called Lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle . &quot;
in this part you are converting the configuration files that are created by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are in the different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file will be dynamically changed to DSL connections , so that it does not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections can be found on any other contents . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is well known that these file could be sorted by the scrip@@ te in Su@@ SE@@ config . &quot;

&quot; the content of the belt can now be integrated into the status bar , the content of the belt can now be seen through the entry of the band &apos;s entry for the band . &quot;
there are three methods to register this .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be deleted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format . &quot;
&quot; if the band has to be form@@ atted before you can be used before use the band from the band to be form@@ atted correctly , before you can adjust the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted your band before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted your band before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; . &quot;
&quot; after input of the band@@ name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the band is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you can select the backup process , you have to select the desired files . this can be done on three types : &quot;
select a file or folders in the local file tree . it will be replaced only this file or the folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . it will be secured in the profile indicated in the profile indicated .
mark files in the local file tree with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
click the right mouse button on the local file tree and select the menu
&quot; once the backup has been started , opens the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the Archive in the entry for the drive . it is only the selected file or the folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . there are only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on the right mouse button in one of the Archive and select the menu item testing ....
once the test process was started to verify the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection and check the working folder for verification .
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog shows the progress of the background and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can transfer the files that will be re@@ produced , will be re@@ produced . this can be done on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . it will be produced only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folder .
click on the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the Archive and select from the menu ...
once the restart process was started to change the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection and work folder for recovery .
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery factors , the dialog shows the progress of the backup process and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is necessary to create the band@@ logo file based on the band content . in this process , all the existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band . &quot;
this is a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings . you can make a secure profile of the following settings :
the current working folder will be updated accordingly . the list of paid files will be updated accordingly according to the selected working folders .
&quot; for all folder you are listed under the same file system , which can be stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folder , which can be used on other file systems , you can be separately available to other file systems , you can be separately ordered separately from the other file system . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine what files are changed since the last ink@@ able backup file , it will be changed since the last ink@@ able backup file . &quot;
the name of the file you used to use the changes since the last ink@@ able backup .
this allows the s@@ app@@ able file before the call of tar . this causes that all files will be secured and a new sn@@ app@@ able file for the next backup .
&quot; the functionality of the buttons &amp; quot ; and lt ; and lt ; files , at the time of the creation of this documentation nor not completely implemented . &quot;
&quot; in the menu settings , you can specify the following settings : in the menu settings you can make the following settings : &quot;
the full path to the device ( normally / dev / lib ) . this path must be the non @-@ binding version of the belt .
&quot; this is active , remove &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band , the command is integrated into the drive . in some drives , this is necessary to be performed before reading or writing operations . &quot;
it is the option to fix &amp; k@@ dat ; the exit at the band@@ flow rate . possibly it works not in all belt applications .
&quot; if you use the option button , you will get the setup of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band . use this option not at Flo@@ pp@@ y Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it is the option to change &amp; k@@ dat ; it is the option to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ working block size for band@@ ages . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must need to print &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only be a memory block on the band . the content of the file is as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n By@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this period is passed on : seconds , with the full name of the system is based on the band format . seconds is the number of seconds , which has been form@@ atted in the band format . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ Archive which should work directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar can work directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar .
the content of a backup link . this symbol is only active if a band is integrated .
&quot; the program is a &amp; k@@ de ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; you can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system will appear on the different protocol . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; system@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ parall@@ eled user , which does not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users for quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes include : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of protocol , for the format of Sys@@ log server and for Samba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters .
&quot; as you see in the following window , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to remove the individual protocol lines of a protocol file , and can be found on the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; to open the start , &amp; k@@ em@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol , you have to open it , and it opens up to a small news window , so you have not be displayed in the folder / var / log , for the normal user should not be found in the folder / var / log . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , you can also use the filter bar in order to adjust the selected filter . in the default setting you will be displayed in the filter box next to the filter . &quot;
&quot; for example in the protocol of course , you can also select the column of the filter search for example . select the name of a process that shows you the name of a process , so shows you with the name of a process , so shows you with the name of a process , so shows you with the name of a process , which is sent by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines with a distinctive color as protocol lines of the stage . the coloured representation of protocol can be switched off .
&quot; in this case you would like to install the process identification ( PID ) to the column process ( PID ) in the column process ( PID ) in the column process ( PID ) . it can be useful if you want to use the output of a specific command as for example to the start of the Samba server . in this case you can use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option of new lines in the context menu of the main menu . &quot;
&quot; if you have a sub@@ window , select the entries in the menu window to open an additional window , select the menu in the menu window . &quot;
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want you slider to appear . &quot;
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads to some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for control of program in the &amp; Linux ; world , and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time as the traditional BSD home in@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go on the historical aspects ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know it : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the In@@ it @-@ binary file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone could try a machine on system V In@@ it , without a new installation and new form@@ atting . &quot;
Sys@@ V In@@ it is also possible by the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc can be found directly in / etc . this folder is the r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of script . basically you need a script for any system service , you want to start on a other Run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include such things like your network , that is only once started . &quot;
&quot; if you need a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it , if you need a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something to do with the serial port . &quot;
&quot; the kernel works at different places , according to the program in@@ it , and starts the first that he finds . &quot;
the default time@@ level is available in / etc / in@@ itt@@ any . you should see in the first area of a row like the following :
&quot; if you want to change a look into the second column , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand , and the 3 change it . if you want to change the system , then you will have the following : &quot;
&quot; but how will it now do all the correct script ? if you enter a l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the Fol@@ ders : &quot;
you will notice that this folder is not correct . instead of each entry is a link to one of the script in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
&quot; how to start and stop in@@ it actually , system services ? quite easy : each of the scrip@@ te is so written that there is a argument like start and stop . you can start this scrip@@ te by hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would be called the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains the script is called , the script is called for the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could find a server -@@ Run@@ level , that only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; network &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; network &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; network &amp; etc ; &quot;
here you can find the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program is so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another piece device is simply to tell you a entry from the available system services to start on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also change scripts between Run@@ time@@ n , or the position within one levels by making it a entry from the available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved if you have to copy this into a new field . in order to select a new Run@@ level , you have to select a copy from the menu folder or from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the sorting number of entry can be charged . in so one case you need to add the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system errors . &quot;
&quot; please note : there is no way to the entries that were cast into the paper basket . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the table key to activate the various working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the Cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of the right or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move a entry into a different Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it in the desired runtime with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press button to accept the properties dialog to accept the changes button to accept the changes to accept the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu is a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if they are available in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
what can I do with the standard Run@@ strips and now starts the machine @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
&quot; enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t = single and press the input to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , and change the default time@@ level on a decent value ( 3 should usually be in order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you have to use additional files in / etc . &quot;
&quot; the results , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration of the proprietary software programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use a other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are not available in the correct directory ) . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , even from version to version . if you want to use other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , that this manual may be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
&quot; in order to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have any changes , you have to save these items . either use the corresponding icon of the tool box or the entry into the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user &apos;s user - and user moves . to Edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears to the dialog user or group features . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings , if you have been enabled ( Qu@@ ota ) for users have enabled , the card card will appear to be installed on the individual settings . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider index.html file in any text editor . &quot;
&quot; this card card only allows for at least a built @-@ in file system configuration ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ating ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ates ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ates ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ates ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( can be changed to the file system ) . here , each user can be changed to each user . &quot;
these parameters can be adjusted for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the help of the field file system with space specific file system .
&quot; the card card will be informed about the group of the selected user . the standard group , to the user is one of the user , you can find in the field of Prim@@ ur Group . furthermore , the users can be found in the field of Prim@@ ur . &quot;
the dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , choose from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate product button or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can add the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove the time to boot the standard operating system , remove the operating system , remove the operating system , remove the operating system . &quot;
