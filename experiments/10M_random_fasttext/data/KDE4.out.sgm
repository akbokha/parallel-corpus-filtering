<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for control of program in the & Linux; world, and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time as the traditional BSD home init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"I will not go on the historical aspects (e.g., because I don't know it: -)."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init-binary file is under / sam and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone could try a machine on system V Init, without a new installation and new formatting."</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init is also possible by the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc can be found directly in / etc. this folder is the rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of script. basically you need a script for any system service, you want to start on a other Runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services include such things like your network, that is only once started."</seg>

<seg id="2966">"but how will it now do all the correct script? if you enter a l enter in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the Folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that this folder is not correct. instead of each entry is a link to one of the script in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init actually, system services? quite easy: each of the scripte is so written that there is a argument like start and stop. you can start this scripte by hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would be called the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains the script is called, the script is called for the argument."</seg>

<seg id="2976">"please note: there is no way to the entries that were cast into the paper basket. be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the table key to activate the various working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the Cursor keys to make a selection of the right or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move a entry into a different Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it in the desired runtime with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
