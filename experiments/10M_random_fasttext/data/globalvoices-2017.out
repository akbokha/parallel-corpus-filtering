&quot; at the same time I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live now for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting .
my love to America is extremely great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I have done with American films , I have read American music get@@ anz@@ t , American authors and his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this land had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enzel Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible rep@@ orter , who wanted to keep his interest in the Federal Constitutional Court , who wanted to have his interest . &quot;
I was born .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Ju@@ ani is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; and this year that I lived in Arizona , my inhabitants had only been strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; America is the only land which I have lived in which I have lived , which you are always , and it is easy to find the acceptance in a community of uniform people . &quot;
I had a very warm love of love with his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the hos@@ tili@@ ties and the rac@@ ism of this man .
the extraordinary aspect of his lifting is for me how he comes with its Eng@@ ag@@ ness .
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former col@@ oni@@ alism , and explains its legitim@@ acy for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , colonial and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people are re@@ tained to his statements and in repro@@ ach for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , he won the highest number , which had ever been reached by the party of the party . &quot;
I was speaking .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , asked me ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t see Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers did not bring with men in harmony that I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ ies , director of the journalist programme , people from the whole world , a deep gl@@ amor@@ ous man , with whom I could write about the Islam and his past . &quot;

&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had arrived at our joint love for basketball , and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; in the game . &quot;
&quot; it is in contrast to the contrast of the movement that I have seen the environment , and their husband , my host family , who were treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; even though they are still interested in the commitment of the Cryst@@ i Kapp@@ es , which are always with much patience and grace , and my colleagues helped us to enjoy the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Ju@@ ani is on @-@ line . &quot;
these people and through them embo@@ died my love to America .
&quot; during the Tr@@ ump of his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential elections , they went to me a stop and the rule of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , however , it is difficult to rule the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his actions against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; with the idea that people for Tr@@ ump was distributed , because they are ready to see his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ m , or because they were ready to see these things , and broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair against the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; one of my friends , one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
that is surface and resp@@ ect@@ ful and is an in@@ ability to understand those who understand the other way and thinking .
it shows the people that their lives and change over the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these vot@@ ers , of whom most of them are , for Tr@@ ump , because they want to win the control over a country . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this field ? &quot;
maybe you can see it .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ ast@@ ered , the cru@@ el decision to rise a man who wants to come to those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m / w / m . : as much as &quot; &quot; resolution of the wheat against all other eth@@ ni@@ bs ; as it is the great Van Jones , exactly what America was so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people on the whole world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background is still a powerful idea . &quot;
&quot; for this land , as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he says , where otherwise in the world is possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ash , however , a huge part of the white world , this promise is on and says : to Hell with versati@@ lity , religious freedom and the whole term of the pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man came back on the Ru@@ der , say they say . &quot;
&quot; at all that I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldiers , who died in Iraq , and what he said on the evening of the election . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Mr. Khan had a word change with the Son of Man . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , Kap@@ n Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a strong &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
would you like to have a place in your America ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; br@@ ace the amount . &quot;

&quot; this Eastern African countries show how technology and Team@@ work was successful in the elections of fisher@@ y , &quot;
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild bourgeois fisher@@ y fights .
&quot; this post was written by Emma Bry@@ ce , originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content . &quot;
&quot; in West Africa , this ship was well known that this ship has already been established in the liberal waters of the waters before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were taken over , and little gen@@ res , a law enforcement of this kind of its coastal waters . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compass , Mos@@ aic and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly it was surrounded by countries that you simply persec@@ uted them . &quot; &quot; is part of a team that discovered the ship s@@ laugh@@ tered . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded in the fish there . &quot;
&quot; however , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network , besides Somalia and Madagascar , six countries that had the Prime Minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this project offers the F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; the illegal fishing boat is hidden by definition , is hidden because it is extremely difficult because it is extremely difficult because it is the illegal fishing of the over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; through the ab@@ rup@@ tions of existing laws , by those particular living rooms and types should be protected by the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems which have a del@@ ic@@ ated balance . &quot;
&quot; but during the actions against the illegal fisher@@ y , the bureaucr@@ atic of fisher@@ y was born in real @-@ time , in real @-@ time , the actions in real @-@ time , with ver@@ ability to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange the individual countries , for example . &quot;
&quot; Fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive when they move on the open lake , by satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to discover the authorities , ships , who are interested in forbidden areas such as such that a ship will be able to discover that a ship will be able to get on other ships on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ case , such investigations may show whether the ships have a fish fan@@ tasi@@ zing , where they were on the way , and maybe even if they were a Stra@@ w@@ gi@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , these ships may not sell their load in their ports . what means that the ships can not sell their load in their ports . so that they can &apos;t sell their load in their ports . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a substantial financial losses for the owners , what means that the illegal fish is financi@@ ally financi@@ ally no longer . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Erik Ber@@ gh , the director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . this is a Ber@@ ater@@ company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front front
&quot; the already existing platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , which will lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year . &quot;
&quot; in East Africa , one of the productive fishing fishing fishing vessels , because the region of commercial fish stocks out of the whole world . &quot;
&quot; their intern@@ ships include actions like the Sailing under false flag , written by fantasy , the fishing protected and fishing in the nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you use the missing international collaboration and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organised control system &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; sooner had a ship illegal and a country . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ al@@ hole tries to close out F@@ ISH @-@ i .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; since its founding , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies . &quot;
&quot; there were crimin@@ als , who had taken care in Tanzania . there were ships to be found in Tanzania . it discovered ships that were several bet@@ ting ships and found it to be found . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i information about illegal fishing boats above large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations will lead us quite far into the networks of organisational crimes &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
it builds a system to help the F@@ ISH @-@ i can help to solve the ships .

&quot; * * * Sor@@ ry , this property owner doesn &apos;t allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen offer very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , one N@@ RO , which also offers a fish@@ eries data , and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships will turn off for example their automatic identification systems that can be no longer supported by satellite channels .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system to build a system that connects different information on each other . it should be F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find crimin@@ alized ships with greater precision .
a model program
&quot; however , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations are actually impact on the common global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ fall , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently there has been a platform with Google and the marine organization Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform Global Wave Watch : a platform that can be displayed in the position of each individual fol@@ dable boat worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chance to get a better image of it , who does where do - this is simple . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine and their resources for investigation . &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; PE@@ W Char@@ ging Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run a global system for the prosec@@ ution of ships .
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only a crime , but they also ab@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
ships that were observed without the licence and hardly believe that they are observed that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the F@@ ISH @-@ i states have a 33 % increase of fisher@@ y revenue , since fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 can be found on board tow@@ ing network , their use is prohibited . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now have other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were six countries involved in the above West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; With safety is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions . &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most popular member of Somalia in its first major triumph in the first major event : in October , there is Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also still in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia to Gre@@ ko 1 , which is a strong sign that they go against illegal fish . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;

my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
during the first and the last time he left me on the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he said to me . he led me to a bar@@ ric@@ ate , in the cars , furniture , television , TV , cooling . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a ceiling of wick@@ ing , and commanded me to bear the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great he@@ ap of silver . &quot;
&quot; on this day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ k where the stolen items were brought to me with a wax . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , he wa@@ ited on an open space and said : &quot;

&quot; and I saw a lift , and saw a lip , on the man , on the man . &quot;
it looked like a field@@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that there was a end of a cab@@ els . the other end was fixed on the body of the person who was built there .
&quot; they contain a man with hand@@ ler to the bed , over@@ cast him with water and pursued him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ als . &quot;

&quot; the Gest@@ ank there was de@@ pressed ... like a dirty Win@@ del . &quot;
&quot; in fact , when my father was held at home , the same smell from his room . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 0 ) 1,@@ 506 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked me , how is it possible that a man can do another so much suffering ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as my father me to work in the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners with hand@@ lers and were made . &quot;
&quot; he said with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a Zi@@ vi@@ lists , which was also registered in the process ) and I use the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people with the face of the face - all were of hands on hands and feet . &quot;
near the entrance of the entrance to the mattress .
&quot; when my father saw that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st du so , But@@ t ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were killed in a pit and came up by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father was about at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were used as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero took a man , and killed a man . &quot;
&quot; ( according to the information from over@@ living expenses of the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , which was indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , the trail of the commem@@ oration of La Per@@ la , the head of the memorial site of La Per@@ la , through the former fol@@ klore chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way , on which you have come here , is also the way to come here . &quot;
&quot; if you look on the card , see that they took about this path and then for the first time . &quot;
these names are changed and they are assigned as part of the process of the human human number .
&quot; when they lived in the cu@@ ad@@ ra , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the above came to it . &quot;
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the cause of man and the dis@@ ab@@ ling of their body in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of all possible things with at home .
&quot; at the age of the age , I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they called it . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was clear that war was a bay@@ on@@ ett , or perhaps a military insignia , which one has made a enemy &apos;s enemy . &quot;

&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this is a small girl . &quot;
&quot; I told me the question : they were killed , but why were they killed ? &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill it , it was easy to kill this people . &quot;
these people are not even families who could take their ster@@ ile remains ?
&quot; on the other hand , the body of the body is the last path of man who can be able to do a man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me to remove the democracy as the democracy again , hol@@ ed them machines to remove the remains of the prisoners of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were killed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but this is what remains of course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are diverse .
you need two important skills : passive voice skills to understand the entire text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
&quot; the latter requires the active decay of the target language - something , which is in the case of the case . in general , the belief that transl@@ ates in the target language - not in the starting language . &quot;
this should be a French language teacher for example from English to French speaking - not from French to English .

many Japanese companies have no employees with English as a native language .

&quot; the following article is the subject to the publication of a report of Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying Co@@ he , the schools &quot; ) , which is edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which they did not work together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her studies of studies at the University , they returned to the house and heard , as the owner of the house full of pride over her . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that is what he has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but the Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated as a daughter .
&quot; as she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as stated in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite easy : a great family with little money , its min@@ der@@ year old son or her min@@ der@@ year &apos;s daughter to another , full family . in the T@@ ausch , the child receives the child food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not mentioned that the children are not mentioned that the children have to be paid for many days in the work , and the victims will be paid and sacrifice , and all that in the framework of a contract that can not be entered into the framework of a contract . &quot;
&quot; this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after the completion of her studio worked Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a few years for a organization , which is for the rights of boys and girls alike . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - mainly young girls are from the practice of cri@@ b@@ az@@ go , resear@@ ched and resear@@ ched and consult@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things during the name , because the feeling of gr@@ atitude to the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as is guaranteed , guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double bed , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who improve their daughter in the belief that they will improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; something from themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other side , the family who takes the girl with faith and its exploitation with faith that they would have a chance to get a chance to get someone else , and maybe even star@@ ving . &quot;
the victim of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is healed , his family is only a lot of years later . &quot;
sometimes they even never know of it .
&quot; in January 2016 the previously un@@ familiar phenomenon which takes place in par@@ agu@@ abo in par@@ agu@@ abo , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as a Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in hospital , she showed her body traces . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former milit@@ ants , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo , which works as Beam@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra as long as with a floor on Mar@@ ín , until they had fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last best@@ seller in the life of the young girl .
a few days later reported the media over the incident .
&quot; of course , that the assass@@ ination of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep into the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ onic Society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for death of the girl .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some do@@ zen people came to protest against the Protest@@ ants , and that there is no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay . &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more than children registered as children registered as children registered , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without Pap@@ iere , it is much easier to understand the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without the official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
&quot; the neighb@@ ors of the couple , and almost 60 civil society organisations became a central investigation of the case . &quot;
&quot; they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ leng@@ th@@ ia &apos;s case - if the first time in history is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are not only as labour forces , they live in isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old , than the Far@@ ewell , in which her father was worked , and her father had lost his work . &quot;
their brothers had to go all the work and began to sell money on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to make money .
they went all to the school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of its employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they had to share the time so that you also had time for learning . &quot;
it was every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .

&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the more time they had done with learning , the more leisure time she had done . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , they had never suffer hungry , but also not unlimited meal . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lord , a liberal party , a liberal party that belonged to the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , from 1954 to 1989 at the power of the opposition . &quot;
&quot; in addition to some abbrevi@@ ations of the land@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to stand and guidance from the op@@ osi@@ ters such as &quot; transmitter &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he tried to convince them to convince them , to convince the reports of the official media over the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he found them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the land@@ er@@ r had not found someone who heard about politics , &quot; says she says . &quot;
&quot; they include me not often to visit my family because they were to visit my family , because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would say that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í at home . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they did the formation , which they had to lose it again , explains it . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that they had been paid for all what they came from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; even in the school was Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discre@@ et . &quot; &quot; a thing about which has never been spoken , mo@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , which Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they realize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I was not able to invite me to me at home . I didn &apos;t know any of the friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very much that I belonged to no group . &quot;

&quot; the six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently concluded a legislative process on the European Court , and the social networks of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he returned from the parliament , the social media have to register for social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then a place will be set to take advantage of the citizens of citizens and to take a permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of the law , the law and users will be able to register at the website of the place with their proper name and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to do this , such as the punishment of up to six months or a cash . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ rams , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt develops , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with other by the voice , video clips and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unc@@ lear how the law is set to ensure that the Egyptian authorities are not subject to the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to move a fire@@ wall to the national level around Facebook . due to those of the Egyp@@ tians were needed for the Egyp@@ tians , and the Egyp@@ tians are needed to access to the network . &quot;
but it is not well known that such plans .
experts and experts on site are sc@@ anned on the technical feasi@@ bility of the presence .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , the Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; to do this , I always have to do with the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt to do with technology to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it might be done so that as they do violent physical public and private rooms also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take seriously seriously , it means that they have a strong surveillance system to monitor citizens , or not . &quot;
this is technically feasi@@ ble - but in Egypt is all possible .
&quot; in order to be used as a law , the design of the Parliament must be discussed in the European Parliament and the Constitutional Court before it comes to the plen@@ ary Session . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and to be successful , or not , the design &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military K@@ ART in the Parliament , in accordance with a pro @-@ military K@@ ART in accordance with a pro @-@ military y@@ K@@ ART in line , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;

&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper has its seat in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ agi . the pre@@ f@@ ecture Mi@@ y@@ agi was an et@@ rical pre@@ f@@ ecture in Jap@@ ans nor@@ theast , which had to experience the earthquake and the t@@ sun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ agi and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear from the map .
&quot; on the other hand , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima has an atom@@ ic accident that had to leave 160 000 inhabitants of their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows up in local view of the progress of six years to build up the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the Newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese market reforms as well as survey results of the association itself .
&quot; the apartment is located in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned inter@@ iors ( ... , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; according to the three times , almost 80 000 people forced to live in se@@ wage treatment . &quot;
&quot; in December , there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ agi , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such areas . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are still more than 75 per cent of ev@@ ac@@ uation , which were re@@ tained by Mi@@ y@@ agi . &quot;

&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear war , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares were destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear ke@@ zone zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ecture in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ecture , the tourism has increased further again , but also remains the Fu@@ kus@@ hima far back . &quot;

is the local population on the next large earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total image , there was a lot of surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated by the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . they asked them over the stand of the re@@ building , and also how you can find it towards the T@@ sun@@ ami risk . &quot;

&quot; the inhabitants of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , which is known in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ an , is generally regarded as el Central - in Spanish sugar @-@ trees - well , that there is no possibility to find a wide variety of sugar . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , as the activities in the sugar pipe fabri@@ ken l@@ ah@@ m@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; after which there was the sugar pipe industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after his systems , until only the wall of steel and concrete . &quot;
about 272 workers had to find themselves new .
some changes the work .
&quot; others re@@ signed , and over them daily to the factories which are still ma@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ di@@ lat@@ an , which every day at 4 : 00 morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry , is not his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that it was in the east of the sugar cane plant@@ ken , which have been preserved after long in@@ active time , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something that he wasn &apos;t expected .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already been the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , which is the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would be on some decades ago , a motif for the land , but the bad deeds are already no more new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar pipe industry ?
the old railway station was already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar pipe systems were technically feasi@@ ble , and hardly any competitive they were able to be able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production objectives of 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they are only the factories left , which su@@ gar@@ ments for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ fs which measures to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ation , and the strain of the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar rate from around a decade will be higher than a decade . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and environmental organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; when the present production of the level of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 , the raw sugar is about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will come with safety in history , which were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar industry in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; since then , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the stand@@ point of a total of 98 sugar pipe fabri@@ ken , more than 65 million people received their full access to the training . &quot;
the same thing happened in the sugar chamber of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I am 14 May 2004 .
Luis Bu@@ re@@ z worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , the closing of the factory is the word that he is most repeated in most . &quot;

&quot; in front of the first Sch@@ ematic year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; there was a lot of interest in documents that are only about the parts that will be removed , and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were of U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could use any compensation . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the responsibility and the letters were always more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the righteous factory , and he was one who received the letters of letters . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy RE@@ YES , 64 years , wa@@ ited on Pen@@ sion@@ ing in a different plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the stand@@ point of the factory , whose construction he helped . &quot;

the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important part model was removed .
&quot; in many cases we have no alternative alternatives to work processes and services , which are created in the munici@@ palities , which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of the 21st October 2002 , the dam@@ aging President in the eyes of the present people , when he was guaranteed that for those who have been more in operation , everything went well . &quot;

&quot; after two years the inhabitants of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am , that many things change , but not always the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar tube head , or better said , when they began , they heard them , they heard the road to asph@@ alted , this may also be given to others . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories . &quot;
they were removed to spare parts .
&quot; at the same time , many young people have the region . &quot;
the area has been created in the area of food industry , whose production serves not once for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still im@@ pos@@ ant .

&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ years C@@ ousin thinks that he is big . and it &apos;s not normal to hear people of the &quot; &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ als &quot; &quot; when they go through the streets . &quot;

&quot; I have asked myself in this terrible days , but the driver is no , because I have forgotten how to live with pain . I have to learn how to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ re@@ z Vega is the contribution to the best known children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z .
&quot; in the introduction , he asked questions concerning the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by the organised crime . &quot;
how is it possible to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys , their parents , whose parents are care for them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells it that he had to bring a egg bo@@ il , potatoes , Tor@@ till@@ as warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the Bab@@ ies that dwell in him . this is his name for the preparation of rivers with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells him from the nine months on his left side - one for each of life .
&quot; they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ acceptable for the whole life of violence , and to learn to live in order to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said that his mother disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , at his childhood . &quot;
&quot; his childhood was already over two years ago , when he saw a few blocks away from his home , the blu@@ esy body of his father , who saw the armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; as Br@@ yan was born , saw the situation in Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by the organized crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z . &quot;
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ re@@ z was the most popular city of the world due to the number of people in public safety and the government of the United States . &quot;

&quot; the picture was seen as a cover for the mass@@ acre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 in 2015 , but the messages that were linked to the religious context were taken in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to judge attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting in the comparison of technology and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;

&quot; in all these cases , the picture may possibly be a correct description , but the original language is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong themes or frames ( inser@@ ts ) , which are the first frame work on religion . &quot;
the picture was used in relation to greater discussions on the relationship with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
&quot; a second to discuss the picture to discuss how a African life in comparison to a European or French lives . &quot;
religion is both important and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth knowing how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a ti@@ reless question is however what happens when reading this pictures are not longer faith .
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have un@@ ques@@ tioning the water around a Trag@@ edy . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the mood of mal@@ nutrition and Fal@@ sch@@ ick is un@@ true . it is the real Gr@@ ands of what actually is in the DR Congo , in Nigeria , and in Myanmar ? &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; a argument is that the return of images of a woman comes to recognize the Trag@@ edy . then , these pictures even even from the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is the concern that violent pictures of readers and viewers are able to find the ability to find Emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as violent media , to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot of violent conflicts in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; together with algorith@@ ms , in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; , &quot; you will have to think about situation in which a picture something could be done , which can be solved from the context or to be completely extended . &quot;
&quot; as a result , they can also be used as internationally as internationally as internationally . &quot;

&quot; my girlfriend to me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not have you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I don &apos;t have a Muslim ma ? &quot;
I have already started this entertainment .
&quot; humans , with whom I have work or people who know me - the Sah@@ ar , who know me - the Sah@@ ar who know they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; , &quot; which has been established in their idea . &quot;
she gets me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims .
we do not see all of them .
we practice our religion .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be Muslim , on different sizes and somehow , we will be able to see all in the same Muslim world . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is located in our collective idea , that as soon as Muslims , as I don &apos;t fit there . &quot;

this is even the poet who were sold in America at the same time : Rum@@ i .

&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I am now , he was a Orthodox mus@@ li@@ ar Pre@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the center of his Po@@ etry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western part , religion was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his Po@@ etry . &quot;
&quot; this is a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world . &quot;
&quot; a other consists in the re@@ productive pictures of Muslims , the Western books already has been a centuries @-@ colonial books since centuries . &quot;
this ver@@ tically image language is determined by the dark man that should be fear and the exotic wife to save you .
&quot; at the end of the war , Edward S@@ aid took the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these pictures are also present today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; I have worked three years long in the news industry and I have seen how to domin@@ ate these powerful , incorrect N@@ arr@@ ative our News@@ feed . &quot;
&quot; in the last three decades , the reality that has led into the last three decades of the women of women their countries , while the USA are not even more than their first female presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; this N@@ arr@@ ative is obliged to recognize that if the French , Muslim women are forced to carry out their head@@ cloth in public buildings and acid @-@ Arabian , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which is both two sides of the same Med@@ al . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group of his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong N@@ arr@@ ative women , women , movements are able to lead the movements of labor . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it sees the first documentary on the American ground of Africa . &quot;
it is the existence of the existence of qu@@ eer Muslim men .
&quot; this N@@ arr@@ ative has created our collective bar@@ gain , such as deep and incorrect , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children are the goal of an@@ tim@@ us@@ li@@ ative attacks and Sch@@ ik@@ an@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the kind , in which we tell , Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of the Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the 1.7 billion , &quot;
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or alternative facts .
we also create N@@ arr@@ ative who help us to understand the world .
&quot; and my industry is un@@ fortunate , the N@@ arr@@ ative of 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; and we are talking about how seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , the sky@@ line of the world was new , my parents were un@@ fortunate Muslims and Americans . &quot;
&quot; but I am now un@@ belief in the Muslim world , and in America ? &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when I ask people , why I don &apos;t ask me - rather than my Muslim recipes . &quot;
&quot; I eat , we wear not all the hand@@ ball with us . &quot;
we do not have any the@@ ological experts to be selected to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional safety at the airport .

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim ma , but a Muslim nation was born in my appointment , when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the under@@ floor of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ an Church in New York . &quot;

&quot; she would see the evening evening with my daughter , when I see them in my arms , and her the Arabian horse to protect the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; every of them , I go three times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that they are being protected from evil , that you can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;

&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the background , but on the subject of word . it is a attempt to get the language variety of large cities . &quot;

&quot; for the project , the project is valid : &quot;
&quot; the mass@@ acre of the world can be avoided when we create cities , which are not forgotten , who are not forgotten , who are not forgotten , who are not forgotten . &quot;
&quot; while listening to those who are connected to understand these events instead &quot; &quot; to hear these events &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel at . &quot;
&quot; in this format , the history of history was first in their own language in their own language , and explain it to English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants do not have a professional history , so their h@@ ass@@ ment and their representation is that it can be taken on it . &quot;
&quot; she call her clothing and emotions , as is the language not longer a barrier . &quot;

we will be res@@ sed and under@@ ed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay attention , which is not their own . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our profitability will not be found with sin@@ k@@ ating pension@@ ers .

&quot; although about the origin of the word , it will be discussed , it is usually used to be used on people Eastern European origin . &quot;

&quot; in recent years the Ascen@@ sion of the Ascen@@ sion of the Ascen@@ sion of the word was given a extremely valuable con@@ not@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , there is a word , which is mostly of ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ an against Muslims , which is a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight Syria in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sensu@@ al content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may be brought with rac@@ ism in connection , but the word to calls itself not automatically in Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that they have given the use of the word , or dou@@ bt@@ ful for its use of its use . &quot;

&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; written , as well as other words like &apos; kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ age b@@ se ) , &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ id@@ &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ff@@ ici@@ er A@@ ung Kay@@ ung is the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; a post of my friends was deleted today , because he was the word cal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on spiritual kind , whether they were w@@ asted , as he made his return , as he made his return , he made a word . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ ameworks ( la ) to Bur@@ mes@@ isch - similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;

what it should have to analyse it is to analyse the post carefully and control him by making the most part of the words .
&quot; for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( sp@@ age b@@ sen ) . &quot;
&quot; the best thing is that this dre@@ aded National alists , the Hass@@ an , a rather good lesson . &quot;
now it &apos;s time to get their national elections .
&quot; while the action is a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ an is to keep the efficiency of this strategy . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ eks have proven that the cement and mouse game will be able to use a new word or an alternative writing of the word to use their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of A@@ ung &apos;s My@@ at work , how to delete his posts when he wanted to delete his posts when he wanted to delete his friends that the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; from the social network is : &quot;
&quot; when I found this new direc@@ tive from Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;

such words can bring out more about the people of the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems that it seems to have been without local context or technical support , and so words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found it , they did not have a mistake , they did not have to re @-@ deleted them . &quot;
&quot; when they were just something more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would have great sales , it would be great . &quot;

&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook and write the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an , to see whether their comments from the net . &quot;

the children of children is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 the Parliament of the country has decided to offer this practice , so that the hei@@ r age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the couple of members of the couple of members of the couple of members , and in May 2016 came to a large public prosec@@ ution , and in May 2016 , the leader of the Inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state is not affected by the state of the country . &quot;
&quot; this happened un@@ aware of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , a contractual partner of the UN General Assembly is to be defined by the minority of 18 years , every man under 18 years . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who have been married with 15 already married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; 2011 confirmed the statistical Central Office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys among 19 married . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , they were killed in the first half of the year . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , there was no need to be smooth . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du guide for instance , had no concerns to say the cri@@ tic of the children to say , they should be part of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition is the power in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and there came to doubt whether the opposition between the law does not agree . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the law of the children were decided in spite of 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a wife ) of the opposition and an independent who would be discussed , so that he could have been a simple majority for the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country will agree with the law .

&quot; Sag@@ ar bon@@ i was with the photos which he saw around around , never really . she was very difficult with bad position and balanced colours . &quot;
the motivated to wear him a camera to wear and try to try the situation .
then he was still a child .
&quot; today , in the age of 28 years , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ ali , Nep@@ tun . &quot;
&quot; and its home place directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to enjoy photos that attract attention on Nep@@ al@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , how it helps to work this first @-@ class situation at its work is : &quot;
&quot; I live on the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t know me at home , when me suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had a call of my father , that at the banks of the Rap@@ ti river . &quot;
the river is just a few minutes from the tourist site Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
I took my camera off with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other River , where the Leopard was and I immediately started to tri@@ p@@ ses ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar is a collaboration with the authorities to achieve a global recognition of Nep@@ al@@ ese , and wants to improve the understanding that wild animals are not so far as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he stood up his face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can be seen from the opinion of the sheep not at sleep ! ! !
late afternoon . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; even I was due to the darkness on the road , when suddenly the king of Bu@@ es@@ ks appeared . he sets out , we shall see us and he will be worn by the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , select Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Con@@ servation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and lived in a tent in order to take a tiger in a tent in the Bar@@ dia National Park photos and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which are nearby the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; in many parts of Indian women with great care , the name of her husband or even by older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pr@@ ism or &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ ak@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h for women to respect women , as well as fear of the consequences . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian State O@@ reg@@ a by a head@@ quarter and by their family and the village of the community , after they had made a ple@@ ated crime with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wife also does not exist in the name , even under men . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ ks in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , on nine women , among women , among women , among health , a unique K@@ lub and became quickly to the main focus of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone to discuss the enemies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
&quot; in 13 Indian States , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is part of the community of the community of Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini , has been working since seven years with the help of their video camera at the end of intern@@ ships , such as children &apos;s Council up to of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ ventions . &quot;
&quot; they reports that they have created a safe place for these women , and at the same time at the same time at the same time . &quot;
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion showed that their hus@@ bands are not at the name . &quot;
it has decided for this topic because they wanted to identify the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; the name of her husband , not according to the name of her husband , a Br@@ ing that they shall keep all mandatory and never in question . &quot;
gender : re : please honor best postings / Lob für Member postings
this tradition is that a woman in her husband knew a long life .
&quot; a woman who do not consider this , as a woman without mor@@ ality , as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; the tradition is so deep , that we have never made us up to this discussion of thought . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , who wanted to try her husband and never before the name , at home , as it runs at home . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother &apos;s mother and my husband too long after the video was at the end .
&quot; my husband , my husband , turned to me , and said , I would call him from his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini began its first meeting club . &quot;
&quot; many women had the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ at &quot; even before . some believed that there was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the start of the lap showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video proj@@ ector , women , the discussion with a exercise in course . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked everyone in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy to say , love , lov@@ ingly , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we don &apos;t say the name of our husband , but they can call us , that they don &apos;t respect ourselves ? &quot;
should it be equal ?
&quot; some of these women have married since 30 years , and this was the first day that they brought the name of her husband , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine from the village of a century tradition , in the ver@@ dict of their husband &apos;s name of their husband . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so sh@@ y , that they had all the exercise only before themselves , and another decided to allow him to allow him to leave him with him and his family come out with him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ st@@ atically .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the ad@@ ren@@ aline , we decided to have the women that they are actually trying to call her husband at home . &quot;
and they thought about her word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini has a multitude of reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked the ideas of women in the head , and his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ mother asked them , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; one other woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini , I decided to do it . &quot;
&quot; a husband of a school was less pleasant , and the situation of art@@ works in violence . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports , such as women tries to stop other intern@@ s , such as for example , in the foreh@@ ead , which shows the couple of the couple . &quot;
why do we show women that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , I would like to wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ y point if he would also be . &quot;
he kis@@ sed him and I heard him to bear him .
&quot; the other women have not completely dis@@ solved , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the meeting club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we have lunch and water and go to the field .
&quot; I would like to make sure that women make women , who could hear what I could hear . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , she held her own birthday with cake ; they dance and san@@ itary , and red@@ dish over things that they had never had thought . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working since so many years ago I have been working on these problems , but I have never spoken about some things , for example such as our identi@@ ties to our husband . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to tell you certain things to say , quite like small them . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion , we have read about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have worked only Sar@@ is .
&quot; for most , the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ mon @-@ cour@@ ta , a shirt of a shirt , wear it ; they don &apos;t have a herb . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of conflict and discussion about the advantages of the own clos@@ et , the mor@@ is and much more , impres@@ ses with Sar@@ is and much more , impres@@ ses of their own pair Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ feld@@ den ) , so that women are able to wear them . &quot;

&quot; on the question , whether in the five months of their first European Parliament have been changed , confirmed by Roh@@ ini that the things slowly come into the rolls : &quot;
we have made a small steps for small steps .
&quot; some women tried to say a few times , but heard again to tell the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , me are included , but only when they are alone , and no other family members are available . &quot;
only one or two say the name of her husband ; only one or two women are now at any time of Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on her foreh@@ ead .
women in the Labour Party know that the changes that they want to achieve more freedom of movement or its own clos@@ eness - at the end of a difficult river .
&quot; by making them self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there .
but this K@@ lub is every one of us that is something to change something .
&quot; and I know that it is not only on 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman is limited to home , and other people of which we speak , and what we do . &quot;
we are sitting at the same boat .

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
&quot; the question may dum@@ b appear , since Singapore on international level as independent state is recognised as independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has a debate in the Blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the state of New York president of the State of New York , the Minister , that many people were compared to the most political party of Singapore , because they compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he said that Singapore as a city should be regarded as a city .
... &quot; no one found in question , whether New York is a democracy ... &quot;
this is where most people get a mistake .
I have to explain that we are different .
we are a town .
we are not a country .
http : / / nullrefer.com / ? http : / / www.w@@ 3.org / 1999 / x@@ html
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es , this valuable country to create that we have no land . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it appears to be a point of view . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , eat the land ? &quot;
&quot; by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he sent a idea , according to the political system of Singapore not with other &apos; normal countries &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the idea that Singapore had to be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco , San Francisco or New York , the cities that will be led to a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the core point of the subject , the good old man from the author@@ isation of the author@@ isation of the author@@ isation will leave the dis@@ counted logic as they are better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests in our press , our Judi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really does non @-@ answers . &quot;
the corresponding questions asked us with non @-@ answers rational type .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to be clear , since they didn &apos;t understand these conclusions . &quot;

&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which the country is part of our city ... &quot;
I don &apos;t understand that .
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am the effort to clari@@ fy this point , unless it was highly paid , in order to be the part of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by An@@ on on the blog , he has published his comment to read the entire relationship of the conference to read the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am better , according to the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am . &quot;
read the story here .
&quot; he said that Singapore is more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he said , why the elections in Singapore is not very important , even if we have free and reliable elections . &quot;
it was in Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities had to win a party ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , he does not mean that in this sense . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is as leader of a her@@ edit@@ ary generation , such pol@@ em@@ ological statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about that what the justice minister of Singapore said , &quot;
&quot; at least I knew I was with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected to be with them , and not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I doubt and I am not sure whether he really believes that he is doing . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review submitted the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am arguments :
&quot; but Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am . &quot;
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we will only be independent and sover@@ eign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which land go to the right rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is a country and city . &quot;

the war of war is still very slow in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ era , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it is now over 20 years , since the ge@@ ological war was officially finished , but its inhabitants are still visible in this part of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic . &quot;
the chosen villages of the northern areas in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ es@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ massage of Ab@@ ch@@ a . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Rus@@ sen , Gre@@ eks , Ab@@ sch@@ ach , Georgia and Armenia , in the area together together . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live in the biggest part of Rus@@ sen and Ab@@ ch@@ ases in the area .
such sett@@ lements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ ari@@ ah .
&quot; in the war period , more than 10,000 people , today there are still a few hundred people in this spirit . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
&quot; since 2011 , the overall population of the district of 16@@ 0,000 people , after they had hardly realized by a decade . &quot;

&quot; however , it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were parish centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now there is only a well @-@ maintained street , with a well @-@ known Pra@@ cht @-@ buildings . &quot;
people who have lived at this place and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have already leave the district .
&quot; in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , there is similar to other villages . &quot;

&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it has just forbidden us that is everything . &quot;
&quot; the girl fl@@ ush her friend and suddenly , they leave the destructive building and disappear . &quot;
many people in the area are working for a small cavity company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .

&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their guest @-@ friend@@ liness . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .

&quot; the Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z and was founded in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and was founded in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . yet , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) a destination for Afri@@ kaner and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are looking for travel .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night stays the guests in simple rooms , with k@@ ills , ab@@ ling walls and beds in metal . &quot;
in the area there are a par@@ rot experiences in a cheese .
there is no way for the hotel - even hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ ic migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z who begin the people in full Classifieds and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ?
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but in this year Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already covered outside cart@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; + 7,00 EUR Shipping 06@@ d 03@@ h : 55@@ m : 21@@ s &quot;
&quot; they help them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they are not able to pay them , they will not pay them with a bal@@ m of the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is a short time ago . &quot;
I have asked him a reasonable peak for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z .

&quot; yes , yes &quot; , &quot; he knew with a smile . &quot; I feel really that it fits , since African women are very nice women . &quot;

she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very well .
&quot; Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , with his sister , the hopes to go to Boston , to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some of Afri@@ cans who are the way in the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then turn north to north . &quot;
&quot; Mama Africa is an unknown name on the track , explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ kaner often come along the route and that the Afri@@ kaner were already on Wh@@ ats@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z .
how many of his companion has lived in Brazil and has lived in Brazil and has worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer championship .
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has started his journey to the United States . &quot;
it &apos;s since months guest at Mama Africa : he sells his cards to save the necessary money to save the bus to Ti@@ ps@@ c .
I wonder whether he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we will never go again , &quot; &quot; he sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; we are always happy to stay in contact . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z tells us that their guests are often to send text messages when they continue to report them , or to report about the course of her trip . &quot;

&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare the chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z is quite well known , but it is not the only radio of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
on the other end of the city leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family migrants were added to their small house . &quot;
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African migrants .
&quot; he has started to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them for a dollar . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings at the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking outside outside . &quot;
from the last 30 days from the last 60 days
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he said . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have reached the border over the wilderness and we arrived .
&quot; there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
&quot; after he lived three years , he has lived after a Raz@@ zia on his working point out of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants backed by tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants of their houses for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ á Mel@@ ange tells me that he is in Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to have money , without a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he has been asked to have been asked for a accommodation and a well @-@ known , a mon@@ ast@@ eries , has offered him roof . &quot;

&quot; at the end of the course , the travelers quiet their teleph@@ ones . &quot;

&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ re@@ z seems happy about that their house is full , but it is even nostal@@ gic , because of which you have gone . &quot;

&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic min@@ orities region in the West Germany , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware to their phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile users on the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web @-@ cleaning &quot; ) to install J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web @-@ cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app is said to receive access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; but k@@ ò@@ n@@ ought to use the authorities to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the autonomous ing of Kaz@@ ak@@ h Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had to charge the app with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the statement of the police said that the app will determine the sources of the sources and the distribution of the Terr@@ ors , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the App as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective Cover for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block porno@@ graphic websites , from online @-@ Bet@@ sy , other users and ph@@ ishing pages to make sure how much time it is online and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app can help to develop a healthy lifestyle to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can be used on a diverse way .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even Hacker @-@ operate to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction stands in harmony with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; as a result of digital c@@ ensu@@ s in China , mostly on the experiences of the users in the Middle East and the South , the reality is very often coated for those who live in remote areas such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities often often extreme c@@ ens@@ ers and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ ines and monitoring . &quot;
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( activities of Mother@@ land China &quot; &quot; ) , the zen@@ ith News in China , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the police of the inhabitants of the community , whether they had the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian is sure that people who use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile device that the people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are interested in a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be used up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a return for the technological development .
they have been forced to use devices that are needed for older people .
this is a form of the cap@@ tivity of tac@@ tical technology .
we are back back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( self @-@ Adhesive letters ) , also includes a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang device , from which the software provides a Windows operating system , and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard disk of your computer . &quot;
&quot; after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city of party , the distribution of illegal content . &quot;
all government and research facilities include universities and research facilities including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office at the operation of their computer and communication devices .
&quot; a current report of the National House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;

&quot; the intention is obvious any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . this action is to identify the Personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them a whole range of other possible reasons , including such that which are in peaceful religious or political communication . &quot;

&quot; they have not added me and my Father than my father , but it was not a pleasure to make my lesson in my lesson - with the promise that the fourth time a pleasure would be a pleasure . &quot;
he set his power over us under proof by making the simpl@@ est concepts that we needed .
&quot; five young people were killed during a peaceful prot@@ esters , such as un@@ ites from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it was , that the city was the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
there are no translations available .
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ imes the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city that is up to the Ar@@ ter@@ ies with state security organisational and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had something cal@@ t , after the power supply in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I noticed the silence , by making several times &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends told enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends , and me ; we prepared for a pra@@ ised picture , that my expectations are full and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you have a spirit of the lamp , but it is not interested in the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I received a call of my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet us at the Military Security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I had the following : no matter how much honey you can go to you - nothing can give you your voice , after you give thee the whole way to the office of the body of the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; let me listen to you , how you are &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar , or you are just enough , if we are not close to you . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ filled eyes fell on me .
&quot; and you will be glad to see me in the eyes , and not on the floor ! &quot;
what I did did not do with courage to do nothing with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I had before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it may be in my heart , E@@ it@@ el@@ an ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I said , &quot; I would not know that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never heard you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est entertainment that was able to me , and I have no word from what I said . &quot;

&quot; I know that my cement was a &quot; &quot; obedience &quot; . &quot; &quot;

what do you leave ? is a cigarette between his fingers or her with ni@@ cot@@ ine lips .
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house who lived in 1967 in 1967 , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family lived up out of her village in Palestine and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family , which had lived in Palestine as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for over six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity that represents the conservative majority and their old @-@ proven opinions on gender , sexu@@ ality and free . &quot;
&quot; with his music , the rac@@ ism and the situation of war , rac@@ ism and the situation of the Arab world . all these issues are not only in his home city of Am@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is known as someone who is unable to feel in his thinking , and he can feel a personal statement with the people who have to suffer from the consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Syria and Libya . &quot;

&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think , because I am a man , while he is in water puri@@ fied N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ance law is that the public transport of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b a certain weakness to break up with old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ tim@@ eline is little to do against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the strap has a warm coffee and the warm the Kent @-@ cigarette in the nose in the nose in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jord@@ i like a prison under free sky , especially when you play a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do fundamental things - like in the public during the Ram@@ adan water to drink not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the interior of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la said , already in the second time . &quot;
&quot; the Islamic State is to support the Islamic State &apos;s Front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the hom@@ osexu@@ als of the hom@@ osexu@@ als of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concert of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Euro MPs and former Pres@@ entations have been said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; straight &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ led . &quot;
&quot; many asser@@ tions , the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free of opinion in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; &quot; progressive Supp@@ er of human rights &quot; &quot; which continue to be decided for a intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to use Rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a more transparent reality in Jord@@ anian , which appears to be seen in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex traff@@ icking to Lei@@ be by his vision of the fate of Arab women . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a critical woman , whose arms and legs themselves up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of many women who lost their lives through the hands of those who have lost their lives . &quot;

&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open for the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ Community , and the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against hom@@ osexu@@ als are not the Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned in Abu Nu@@ as , a poet of the eighth century , which was still alive today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was later on behalf of pot@@ ting work , in the eighth century , why , Jord@@ an@@ ier does not work ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem is so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , not with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert has been said to do . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free election campaign and that progressive votes shall be brought to be . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ an news service for several former government and members of the teacher , with the reason , they had come to the comment@@ aries to the comment@@ aries , which were in the country with the deep in the land of corruption . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs is only the tip of the Eis@@ berg - the real challenge is to cause a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; today , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la will take part in a performance but the way of progress , but the way of progress , it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of blue , respect and inner changes . he is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , as a million other Arab@@ s , as much of the Arab world without inter@@ interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he knows not only from it , his work up to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is based on music , art and literature of real and fundamental op@@ enness , and not by bombs , police , and on artificial species . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the written version of the issue of &quot; &quot; love , &quot; &quot; which has published an international online magazine &quot; after T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the contribution is published in the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we know only love to people who know what we know ?
&quot; it is not much more important , people who feel to feel safe , aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation .
&quot; after years of short @-@ term , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ ari@@ zation of a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ ari@@ zation of the armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was the sub@@ section of the peace policy as such as important , the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos for his efforts to join the Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Kolum@@ ba , it is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and of peace . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ak@@ ti , who have lived up many years in the illegal camps , and around the clock , their weapons have had to integrate into life as a Zi@@ vi@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the kol@@ um@@ bi@@ ous society will turn up the life in constant anxiety , and in some cases deep in some cases in some cases , it has now to support them in their ranks and to build up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans decided to close the integration process and in the integration process .
&quot; and exactly this did they have been written : until now , of thousands of young people were written in the United States . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one of each former Guer@@ ill@@ aries - which will be established in person .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was established in Bog@@ ot@@ á , in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; this said that we love people that we love , at Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who forget that they need much . &quot;
&quot; he continued his love with people , in this year his love with people to share their love with people . &quot;
&quot; this was the plan to write letters of hope and support for former minister of the FAR@@ C . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society will be willing to take part in a joint history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the campaign , more than 2000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is in all larger cities such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never thought that I would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were held on 19 March in one of the UN warehouse in the region Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ ehr@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ species in the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the FAR@@ C set themselves as they had done before it had done in order to accept the commands of their bodies .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of sub@@ sist@@ ence of people from the whole country . &quot;
&quot; it was unbeliev@@ able moment for all participants . &quot; it is unbeliev@@ able , how many different feelings can be seen in just a few hours . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had taken the letters , she brought me a former army through the camp of the Guer@@ illa @-@ Committee . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cabin , in which the Guer@@ ill@@ ary kingdom ) , I saw a Guer@@ ill@@ ary , which wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear , because of him on the bed , a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ o.com , a deadly weapon in Dorn@@ tur@@ ret . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; You answered , &quot; &quot; I have written a letter that someone has written . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Ju@@ ani is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; I went out , and sat down to the gran@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry to write all the years of the faithful companion , and wanted to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never thought about his life . he had never thought to preserve him as war . &quot; &quot; I have never thought that someone would have to forgive me for my mistake . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society that is open with open arms .
&quot; to now , I only learned how I have to work with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where Peace is , I can learn many things and in dignity . &quot;

the students were all grew up as a war and the FAR@@ C already had already been born in Ver@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the FAR@@ C the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; &quot; many years we have experienced , how to develop a political party , we can contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people say to hear that people had found no election , and realize that people that I have seen as a Monster and even the environment that I have seen as a Monster and even the environment , which was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the land lives , do me like me . &quot;
&quot; but it came to me that all people - even those who were killed and so much damage to us , and a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;

&quot; as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as long as a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , it will always be willing to access to the weapons , and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the FAR@@ C now , now on peace , for a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the defense of peace - no matter which race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word to make our contribution and make victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . &quot;
&quot; in our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; one day , I told me that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; in this case , there was no doubt about Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ gression that is in trouble . &quot;
&quot; they had no money , so I took them without words . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and widespread them everywhere in the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; as I just wanted to get a couple of shopping from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice say : &quot; here is a gift for you from your On@@ kel . &quot;
&quot; when I turned me , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Cher@@ et@@ een : &quot; how long will you know the family still ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person .
I know that there was a young man was no 30 years old .
&quot; then , I lost the consciousness and aw@@ akening of the hospital in the hospital . &quot;
and in order to thank all women everything to get and started .
the man was bra@@ i@@ ded .
the women had been called a nur@@ ser@@ y .
in the hospital I know that I couldn &apos;t be overcome in my right leg .

OC Media : how has your family tries to go with this print ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people say to my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family but the whole country . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have any stir , because you don &apos;t have any other woman , but you need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a Stri@@ ck around the neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighb@@ ors and ret@@ ailing them . &quot;
at the time I had to change the apartment .
&quot; I went to a flat and already a few hours later , under the window , a car with a dark window , and a num@@ eric keyboard with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after the third time , I was clear that there was something bad . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Ju@@ ani is on @-@ line . &quot;
OC Media : how are you bra@@ i@@ ded ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Ju@@ ani is on @-@ line . if your company is not yet listed , you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; with their help , I have left the land , but then it happened . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .

&quot; in the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by Wh@@ ats@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t have to leave you in safety , only because you leave the land ? &quot;
&quot; our people know , in which hotel you know . they know your room number . &quot;
&quot; in order to prove it , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ?
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family still in contact ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; the sexual inter@@ acts , however , however , is not that this is a tab@@ box . &quot;
some of the traditional elements I am still in me .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Sexy@@ Ju@@ ani is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that , as long as my mother &apos;s life is , I will do my best to leave them . &quot;
&quot; when we have to look with camera , I give me indeed , how the person can see themselves from their past , so that my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Cher@@ et@@ ro ?
what do you do your friends , those who have stayed ? &quot;
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington .
for more information about the situation in Cher@@ et@@ ro .
I spoke with someone who has a and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan no man had no man , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ adan had hardly wait for a new wave . &quot;
&quot; most likely , it will be most likely to focus on the family and at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in this way , my opinion , it is likely to find the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; &quot; through the blood gen@@ ug@@ tu@@ tion . &quot;

&quot; I believe in 2003 , I was already known in the Gro@@ sn@@ y , when I lived there , and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was , I never have problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; in Russia , Russia would like to lead us into the &quot; dig@@ ging &quot; , &quot; but finally , in the stone time . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law possible ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were filled ; I had been painted silk eyel@@ ashes to the valve and short Tops .
the security Ministry of the Sch@@ aria has never been written only a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ sn@@ y , there was a place where every evening , especially on week@@ ends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several b@@ ills were , and the whole city of them ; they knew why men , young people , there were met . &quot;
we were never married .
&quot; this means that &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ell@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . &quot; this means : &quot; Sp@@ ell@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . this means : &quot; Sp@@ ell@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . &quot;
you say it is often to children if those who do more than sick people .
&quot; OC Media : so they have just keep their eyes before you , because they believed that you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; you have never left me , never die , and never said . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad time ?
Sabrina : so long , to Kad@@ y@@ rov on the Plan . &quot;
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister , he began to talk in television about mor@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but pre@@ dest@@ ined over the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , they were killed . &quot;
&quot; in the time , I was born to Ch@@ et@@ ro . &quot;
&quot; but every time when I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic . &quot;
OC Media : what activities do you go to ?
Sabrina : I have been working as a Kell@@ ner@@ in .
I didn &apos;t know much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much too much .
I &apos;m still working as a active business .
that &apos;s why I am for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ olog@@ in .
&quot; we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ance , meeting information , I sent them to hospital , and help them to help them . &quot;

so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practice men who go into the mos@@ que and during the Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
&quot; you know , many think of the tran@@ sports of men , men love them , and believe that you should be able to make more intimate experience to make more intimate experiences . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be precisely to be different , different lives settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it &apos;s the most important thing in my own skin and do not feel for my body . &quot;
don &apos;t know whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , but my last time relationship is now longer than a year . &quot;
&quot; and I &apos;m not in love , but I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m at home . &quot;

&quot; since the last months , there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ ality . &quot;

Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south of the Iran@@ ians .
&quot; he l@@ itt under attack , depression , and he sh@@ ou@@ ted himself for his own assistance , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube video , the moments when he had heard themselves . &quot;
&quot; some people went quickly to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into a valley hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , local resources were so strong that the doctors have nothing more to do . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only self @-@ suicide , which is in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ minority , and activists who could take up more men . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights Reserved that this month are some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ ao , S@@ im Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a matter , there were all the family members who were killed due to the persecution of the ir@@ regular government , to go and un@@ noticed their families , and a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which one of the most significant economic crisis in Iran was hard to take place from a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to ride their lives . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an independent aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ mon@@ archy the power took place and 1925 great efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy in all Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z Region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s largest oil and gas fields as well as some of the most tragic and valuable areas of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resource , regional economy continues to be slow , and the local population is only little by this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ fruit@@ ful disorders , hunger and relaxation . &quot;
the Iranian regime refused to systematically discuss jobs in the local oil of gas , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has been built a number of d@@ welt in the region where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m , are offered by the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
these are only used to destroy the region through drying and the local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms of industry .

&quot; a &quot; systematic strategy ... to destroy the spirit of national resistance , &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ mi , a ir@@ regular Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase &quot; of self @-@ mor@@ ality among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
Do@@ hi@@ mi said that especially the unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors in Ah@@ wa@@ z new an@@ coming ethnic min@@ orities and a anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process process :
&quot; there are functions such as functional and institutions , not the Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i access to working possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which is to destroy the spirit of national contradic@@ tions and to destroy their lives outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who need to change their own and sur@@ name , as even the Arab name will not be toler@@ ated , as even the Arab names are not toler@@ ated , even for the female of the Arab language or the male clothing . &quot;
&quot; in view of the given circumstances which the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to bear in the human rights of the human rights , before the situation . &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the statement , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i . the article was an item of several discussions , which came up many different positions . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I have no femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who are themselves as inter@@ ven@@ ous femin@@ ists . &quot;
you wonder why I don &apos;t see part of the movement .
&quot; they are even well known as scientific and social arguments from me , why I am femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; * * * Sor@@ ry , this property owner doesn &apos;t provide a description in english ... &quot;
&quot; in fact , women are still under str@@ inged observation , when it comes to what they do with their bodies . &quot;
violence against women a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards are still to ensure that women sooner or later in diverse fields of life on a smooth ceiling , and the discrimination of the sex are still going through the many different countries and the members . &quot;
all this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced that I was twice and three times .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I have chosen to talk to skin , on rac@@ ism , on black women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all of that women - all women - together to sing their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing , to achieve the equality of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to speak about sexual violence , a institutional form of rac@@ ism , which we are of black women on two different species . &quot;
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ bs and Her@@ ms are less than white men and women .
this black girls and girls with Mig@@ m@@ sh@@ inter@@ com is more than white girls because of obvious integrity problems .
&quot; women in black Sp@@ h@@ ues and women with mig@@ ration@@ alization to a higher risk of violence , violence and violence in the partnership , as a white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want to connect all the women , all men and all people who have the same rights ; on the other hand , I am not aware of the same rights ; on the other hand , I can take me as a black woman , who is aware of our thinking in their thinking , which both on the gender as well on the skin in one person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhau@@ sted and will not be able to fight my stat@@ u@@ ity in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented battle , who has always always been able to fight against me and again other black women . &quot;
&quot; in their speech , 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I have no wife ? &quot; &quot; and I will get a ide@@ ology that is in the black woman in historical ways . &quot;
&quot; I decided to close myself , to close my group , which absor@@ bs our sitting and customs , to close their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ um program . &quot;
&quot; for some of them , the importance of the over@@ dos@@ ages of skin colour and gender equality . for some of them will continue to fight for the femin@@ ist movement of the dead , no such as many of the women who try to deal with an evil . &quot;
&quot; even though the inter@@ section of femin@@ ism has been established to give women of different ways to give women a home , and to make the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I must be able to close myself , and to close the movement of the Wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman in life , rather than a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and let us be created by us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ cana Cris@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by our own type and not only that - black women can be able to defend ourselves by ourselves , and in which the cultural , spiritual , physical , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements that can be the black wife . &quot;
&quot; ob@@ taining some white and inter@@ ven@@ ed femin@@ ist@@ ers immediately , after they read these lines , please let me know about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of the femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in an infinite environment , I can take black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradig@@ ma . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradig@@ m .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , there is not a public opinion , as many women of each year were killed by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only up to August 2016 , journalists are at least 12 cases of women &apos;s land in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay document at least 37 cases where women were killed by their current or former partners .

&quot; the original legisl@@ ator had to be carried out by the most of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs , which must be given to the victims of violence . &quot;

in Paraguay it will be seen as part of human relationships .
&quot; there must be a change , that violence does not know more than anything standard . &quot;

&quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; sets the worldwide food production . &quot;
&quot; this post was edited by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been in the United States since the 1980s in the USA .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant that has been used by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ aut . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ons work only through its own inser@@ tion , and the question how many sal@@ at@@ ers can get to borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000@@ er he had been pat@@ ched , and that he was pat@@ ched and that he could not go further . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tea or var@@ nis@@ hing leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more of such patents are becoming more plants such as cer@@ eals or cart@@ ot@@ t@@ ens@@ ers . due to this trends , plant extracts , environmental protection and experts for food safety to the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ ennium old tradition , Mort@@ on is still alive . it needs to be more time since its work through always more limitations . &quot;
it is what would be in a river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; I think that this Pat@@ ents have to go far away . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can see more than a new Sal@@ at@@ sor@@ ption , because all features are patented . &quot;
&quot; however , however , it is very difficult to use a material that is being protected by the other property . &quot;
&quot; he has a movement in the USA and everywhere in the world , and everywhere in the world and everywhere in the world : Open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;

&quot; for other plants there are such information , but experts like Lu@@ by , that mass@@ ac@@ eful plants such as wheat in the greatest style pat@@ tern@@ ed as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants will be dis@@ advant@@ ageous - from such , through which their taste or their colour improved up to such , because of them in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ellets or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of Pat@@ ents on plant characteristics , that the available plant material is currently at the same time as ever as ever before , as the changing conditions by climate change is much worse than ever before . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail to Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ c in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ missible , that genetic diversity generally is important and also important for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four casting and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , the fact that many other bre@@ eders are able to promote other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant extracts innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is taken to be a plan that can follow once the patent . &quot;
often they help others to come with another method for the same result .
&quot; such protection is therefore not , but promotes it by using the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait , until a patent factor , is certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are so long to wait for a long time , plants can be adapted to plants that would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the real estate site for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general , and it should also continue to remain independent of the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ archy incen@@ tives are not attractive . &quot;
we want to facilitate farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; it is what us is , and it is impossible to use us if we cannot use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; now , Mort@@ on an concept on the concept to pat@@ rol , plant features , &quot; we create the features not really yourself . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them out of and as bre@@ eders , we don &apos;t know how the plants do . &quot;
a mystery of nature .
&quot; for car@@ ol deport@@ pe , plant plants in the US State O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i Group , there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot;
&quot; who is responsible for industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tural techniques , which are not needed in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2012 &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are based on international markets , but smaller than for example . Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , even without patents to survive - either the pat@@ tern@@ ess or they are not worth@@ while or both is the case . &quot;
&quot; the independent plant , Frank Mort@@ on was born in his breeding garden of Sal@@ ate . &quot;
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders are patented by preventing herbal patented brand : &quot; it looks like to produce my efforts , stronger than companies , the patented . &quot;
&quot; I do not want to sell new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will be able to sell my varieties in a few years . &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the US in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding method is leading to the concept of the concept , but fast on the whole world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the center for Sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Building &quot; ) , which works as professional organization in the area of agriculture , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme , the centre with farmers together and helps them to meet new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; concept and your own own . &quot;

all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
&quot; the moti@@ fs for their decision , the newspaper said : &quot;
&quot; this is our way to call a crime in the world &quot; war in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call this : this is not normal ! ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;

&quot; but we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civil power , but the economic power of the property and their partners . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; more than it does . &quot;
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Men &apos;s journalist &apos;s journalist Sher@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot;
this is no war .

&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the great majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be transferred into the more than 3000 &quot; special turn@@ around centres . &quot; &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can be shared only if they are officially recognised if they are officially recognised for the registration of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for a accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or to have to sleep on the road . &quot;
so it also be A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ comfortable life @-@ w@@ ille helped A@@ shar@@ af , soon to set out of these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after he made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af its entire creation in the creation of a hotel in Venice . &quot;
