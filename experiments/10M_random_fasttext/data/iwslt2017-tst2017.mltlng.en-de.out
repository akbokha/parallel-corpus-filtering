this is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; they know him , because he won as New York Times @-@ Rep@@ orter &apos;s Pul@@ itzer Prize . &quot;
&quot; long before any one of Edward Snow@@ den heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book , in which he heard a book , in which he heard the N@@ SA &apos;s teleph@@ ones . &quot;
but it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this case , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ ph@@ al US intelligence officer , in which the CIA the Iran has literally over@@ turned into force for a nuclear bom@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , you can read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not have to do ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government against Ris@@ en was determined and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he was to condem@@ n the symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the Media has the right to publish a secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to get this right if media will not get any information about this information , and if they cannot protect it . &quot;
&quot; so as the government in Ris@@ en ank@@ lo@@ om , he did not know what many mu@@ te rep@@ orters have already said before him , he said that he would have to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en &apos;s risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , it was a little outside . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were not essential for their case , the demands of the government would fall . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic control , the rep@@ orter and sources will always be less expensive . &quot;
&quot; instead of edi@@ ble and ris@@ ky to the statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the investigations shall be pun@@ ished without his rede@@ mption , his teleph@@ ony had been worried , &quot;
&quot; as such as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they use used to Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ king source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama said to protect him , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ less , but instead , the justice more condemned than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now , you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work . &quot;
&quot; since the 11th of September , almost every article about national security is the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower than one journalists . &quot;
&quot; we set the press work on the game which are being protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has always been more possibilities to help everyone else . &quot;
&quot; but as such as technology of the government allows the rights of rep@@ or@@ ments , the press can use technologies to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and yet , they can be seen from the moment in which they come to contact , rather than in the night . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that there are not yet been written , as Ris@@ en is written , and it is much safer than normal email or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ sis , an open source analysis system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet of the internet , which was developed by us from the internet of the Press Foundation , which was developed by us . &quot;
&quot; instead of a e @-@ mail to send e @-@ mail , go to a News Site , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can change documents or information , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
this will then encryp@@ t the encryp@@ ted and stored on a server .
&quot; therefore , the government cannot see more information , and many of the information that they don &apos;t know , would not be available . &quot;
the Sec@@ ure@@ sis is only a small part of the building to protect the press of the 21st century .

&quot; these technologies are not only for those who want to cover the crime , but to protect our of all rights rights . &quot;

&quot; it seems to me away from you , me , unusual people . &quot;
why should we go to what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powers in the location are , their assets are to pay taxes and not all their taxes , then this is less money for important public services such as mobility , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , are these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world discuss the media and leading politicians , such as a secret control of some few people , their assets and wear it -- something that we have been able to discuss and reveal it for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think this whole world is very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how to work it . &quot;
I imagine I always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ lip .
&quot; therefore , a company in another company , in another company , in another company , what it is almost impossible to understand who behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult to understand the judgment and control authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter .
&quot; probably because there was no prominent Americans who came in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal will come . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there is no way that there is no more Americans who do their assets in tax . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , according to these tax work , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have a data l@@ eck from the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples of connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need to change in some US states less information , fewer information need to be able to get a company to get a library to get a library . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparent in the USA has allowed them to fly school trips to school children .

&quot; finally we decided to wait to wait until both hosts and guest their Be@@ ans were before , before we were online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have done a study , how probably it is that people can trust in one another , depending on the age of age . &quot;
the most important thing is that most of us is the most important part of the most important part of the world .
&quot; the more differences we find , the more confidence we do . &quot;
this is a natural social prec@@ au@@ tion .
&quot; in our case , it is exciting if you added the call to a person -- in our case . &quot;

&quot; there is also an optimal degree of offset , such as &quot; T@@ olle with your apartment ! I make with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design to produce these degrees of offset ?

the regular visit of a mos@@ que will be able to show people other faith toler@@ ant and larger citizens .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told us , people will not work in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they will be radical in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alisation process , it has been found that it starts online . as a First , the person is believed that the person believes that the person is believed that the person believes that the extre@@ mes is the true Muslims , and each of their behavior , and their ide@@ ology , is a promise or by faith . &quot;
&quot; when we do radic@@ alization , we need to keep the people to go to mos@@ que . &quot;
some are still going to asser@@ t that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS her bro@@ och with the Kor@@ an . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I think that we have to stop everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would like to add us into their presence , when one sees them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; of course , both groups represent their ide@@ ology , on their &quot; Holy book . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but if one look at it , they do not know what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot;
it is their breeding that they can read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
an excellent I@@ mam told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him because she would have been to close the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him to have been in contact with radical views .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , they had spoken unto him , and said her anger , her sense of inj@@ us@@ tice for the inj@@ us@@ tice in the world . &quot;
&quot; nothing is inspired and something that her anger was given , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through extre@@ mi@@ sts that you have a solution . &quot;
&quot; this I@@ mam stated the connection to God , and their congregation . &quot;
&quot; instead of her for her anger , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for a real time in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they found in mos@@ que , keep it away to close the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it happen to normal Americans ?
what does it happen to every other ?
how is the 24 @-@ hour generation of fear every day on our democracy on our thought movement ?
&quot; a study -- actually , several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we are fear to happen at least three things . &quot;
we accept a authorized government system , declaration and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

that is not only a academic problem .
&quot; when you look , when the mood against Muslims according to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened during the time of the I@@ rak@@ ek@@ es and during two election periods .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; 7 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; it is actually a tool for the man@@ ip@@ ulation of the public to treat the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of the Muslim is a early warning .
we feel it perhaps as the first but the toxic air of fear is afraid of all .

so back to the beginning .
what happened to the 9 / 11 ?
we are at the mos@@ que or we stayed in at home ?
&quot; we loved it and for us , there was no light decision , because it went to our children of our children : one that we can control ourselves by fear , or one , in which we can do our religion . &quot;
we decided to meet us for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s chair , we live with high pressure on mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went my shoes , went into the bones , and what I saw that I saw me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam had a announcement , and he called our guests , for the half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come not to fight us , but to take us by us . &quot;

&quot; before the air is built in our social consciousness , a aut@@ on@@ ous fleet of flight machines in the fra@@ c Centre in France live from the audience a six meters high tower from 1 500 square . &quot;
it is possible to achieve high speed and acceleration at the most important space .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they have learned to wear loads to react with tur@@ bul@@ enzen and generally to react to natural forces .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the imper@@ ative to cross the autonomous flight .
&quot; to create a system aut@@ on@@ om , it must be interesting to know where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to handle objects . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s Dem@@ os , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a pre@@ processor of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations which should do the machine .
External instructions are available on the highest priority . for example , start &quot; start &quot; and &quot; . &quot;

&quot; as other Star@@ r@@ ware , it is more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; unlike most cases , it is pregnant , and has therefore very versatile benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a cat side . &quot;
it is possible to react to tur@@ bul@@ ls such as wind@@ mills as wind@@ shield .
we develop new control and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea is that the air@@ device can be re@@ tained in which position the optimal position and the performance can be improved .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often have fundamental questions concerning the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter parts are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts that are able to prevent you .
&quot; before decades ago , trained air@@ controlled aircraft devices that were only two moving parts : a propeller and a rear of the rear . &quot;
&quot; in a long time , we asked that F@@ lies with only one work . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ i , the mechan@@ ically controlled air device . it was used before short . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a propeller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ amps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ base , no further actuators or control surfaces , only a propeller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically imp@@ el , it happens in the interior of very much so that it can be stable and can move up in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it &apos;s not about the elegant display of the rear light . to bring it to the back , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability that is exactly right , if you have to view all , it is low , that is why you have been filtered by the evening in the evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ i is a exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ ppel , this machine is here , the Omni@@ directional with its eight propeller , a exercise in over@@ flow . &quot;
what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
you can see that it is not symm@@ et@@ rical .
that is why he is involved in his alignment .
&quot; in this case , he receives the au@@ ra ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room in all directions , no matter where direction is turned or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , he is complex , mainly in the area of interactive maps from the eight propeller . &quot;
&quot; the rest is available in models , the rest will be directed directly at the level . &quot;
we see that .
&quot; if flight machines will be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ aircraft machines .
this is c@@ lock@@ wise in the watch@@ strap .
and the other against the watch@@ word .
&quot; when one sees them together , they look like a high @-@ high Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , the electronics or propeller is made up , the electronics or a battery -- can fly over the machine . &quot;
&quot; we will demonstrate this , by providing a half @-@ time period of time . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , synthetic waste heat . &quot;
&quot; the great number of autonomous , coordinates units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we took a commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual is less than a disc bread -- and , with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; each unit white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . &quot;
hope you will be motivated to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine is a flying lamp to a flying lamp .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to see the impact of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types such as us , the reward in the development and the Schaff@@ hausen . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , wise and wise to forms it on so spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential is the bag climbing on the i .

&quot; from 1.3 billion years ago , straight ahead of life on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has brought the Earth : coral , fish , plants , sau@@ lt , people and -- God will stand up to us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; for about 25 years ago , a group especially Mu@@ eller -- Ra@@ i White from WITH , RON@@ G and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to build up to gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts . &quot;
most of it thought for crazy .
&quot; but enough people are treated as a result of gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation their idea . &quot;
&quot; according to decades , construction , design , conception and extremely much har@@ ness of work they needed the detector : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ers and Gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts . &quot;
&quot; in the following time the precision of li@@ go considerably increased , what the increase performance is enormous improved . &quot;
this is why you can see it now .

&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detectors , the gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts of the two kol@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot;

Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :

a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a solar panel in the field of space and time .

&quot; as a result , Do@@ z@@ ist is often used in Kur@@ sen to the Rel@@ ativity of theory often a correct dance . &quot;
&quot; dust and dust , gas and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts are extremely weak , even more difficult . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was given by us during the change of the waves of the waves . &quot;
&quot; this means that 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the com@@ ma , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one declared the li@@ go @-@ employee for crazy . &quot;

we can &apos;t work with them no simple images from objects in the All .

what are you ?
what am I ?
I &apos;m still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then , my &quot; &quot; South states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; &quot; was a question . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late , and she says : &quot; Mama , magic you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , as my two things are aware of : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say to say , and second@@ ly , they called me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happens ?
&quot; I do it , when I am Titan , and my sum@@ s pra@@ yed , and here changes everything before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so says , &quot; Mama , magic you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh much and I read quite dramatic out of the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing found .

&quot; and now , I think I would know a magical secret . &quot;

it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
&quot; the Sum@@ men , the working sum@@ s , which is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; when I tell you , if I tell you , if I tell you , if I tell you , if I tell me , if I have forgotten my brain , then I have forgotten what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the Sum@@ men is no power and it is non @-@ specific .
it is from the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on the love .
Sum@@ ms is the current who comes from the living of life .
the real Sum@@ ms is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is ignored the pressure of history , which is to make di@@ spar@@ ed tasks , the expectations and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps the wrong words , for which God said unto me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .

I am Neuro@@ chir@@ ur@@ gin .
how most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human beings .
&quot; I know how to change your life from a second to the other , after a heavy rain or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ degener@@ ative , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain is in contrast to other body organic , a very small capacity for self @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; according to a serious violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a consistent , severe dis@@ abilities . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ chir@@ ur@@ ning .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical measures .
&quot; in spite of one of the most famous one is one of the most famous one of the most famous one of the &quot; deep pavilion &quot; . &quot; the implant@@ ation of the neur@@ ons to influence the circuit break@@ through of the neur@@ ons , to influence the neurolog@@ ical function . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we are looking forward to this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with something help , the brain can help yourself . &quot;
the history began before 15 years ago .
&quot; at the time I had conduc@@ tors and worked day and night in emergency . &quot;
&quot; often , I would like to thank all patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma . &quot;
you need to imagine that in the skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a is the brain tri@@ mming and the skull pressure .
&quot; in order to save the life , you need to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you have to remove a part of the brain . &quot;
&quot; instead of the trained brain mass , we decided to analyse us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I do with this ?
we wanted to grow the cells from this tissue .
that is not easy task .
cells of an Ge@@ we@@ k is growing to grow is comparable with very small children who will be taken out of your families .
&quot; you need to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to allow them to be patient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , we had to do with these cells . &quot;
Jean @-@ François Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Restru@@ c@@ turing and Corporate Rescue
that saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was for us a great surprise .
why ?
&quot; with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you may know of the Bible lesson that stem cells are unc@@ lear cells that can convert into every cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain is the cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nuts of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive these kinds of stem cells from the surface fabric of the brain mass in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active . they share very quickly .
&quot; they die , they are unknown . &quot;
but these cells were kept differently .
they distributed slowly and after a few weeks .
&quot; on the other hand , we saw a new , strange cell death , which looked like the cells , but differently . &quot;
we had long to understand how they came .
they are from these cells .
&quot; these blue and red cells , Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells . &quot;
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large intest@@ ines cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the F@@ öt@@ us , they care for the movement of the brain . &quot;
but why do they receive us ?
we don &apos;t know .
&quot; we believe that they are at the healing of the brain , since we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near the brain . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so sure . &quot;
&quot; however , a matter is clear -- from these cells we received our cells . &quot;
we stand before a potential cell source which allows the brain .
we had to prove that we had to prove .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking part of the non @-@ speaking part of the non @-@ speaking area and then the cells exactly as a Jean @-@ François did .
&quot; and then , in order to pursue them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; in the last step , we developed them at the depart@@ ing office in the last step . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we can happen this cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we pass the same cells into different brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Thomas Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkey . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we found the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken back home . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we get a violation of and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ zed exactly the same cells , and now the cells have been preserved to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ating .
the proof that they show these small points are these small points . these are the cells that we are in vit@@ ro in the culture of the culture .
here we couldn &apos;t stop .
&quot; in addition , these cells also have a monkey to recover from a hem@@ isph@@ ere ? &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they had to take feeding p@@ ellets from a tray .
this made it very good .
&quot; as it reaches a stable level of level , the last we had reached the motor@@ mot@@ ions of the hand@@ mot@@ ions range . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkey , the monkey , they couldn &apos;t move her hand . &quot;
&quot; just like to happen , they would have to happen to a certain degree , exactly as after an attack . &quot;
the patients are yellow@@ ish and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover spray into a certain degree as well as the monkey .
&quot; when we were sure that the A@@ ffe &apos;s degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we had to reach its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , they see the monkey . &quot;
it can be approximately 40 % up to 50 % of its original performance .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we see the cells of the cells , the same A@@ ffe , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can say that we were very exciting results .
since this time we have found very much more about this cells .
we can use them and later use them .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still being able to assist in humans .
I hope that I can show you soon as the human brain is the means to heal itself .

J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ic@@ at , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , like many years , it can be available to a hospital , and this therapy is available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; at first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will we allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patient treatments and to rate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; in this way , you must be able to use a multi@@ functional study . &quot;
you need to know that it can be useful if you can offer this treatment .

we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is true .

&quot; in this moment , I thought that there was no better place for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my favourite friends who would seem to change the democracy , if they want to change the democracy . &quot;
I would like to present you a real model for a real democracy .
&quot; I don &apos;t hesitate to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group . &quot;

&quot; like a candle , which is very bright , it is also quick . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal democr@@ ats their roots not in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the smooth revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy itself on the free citizens and the working poor , is based our liberal democracy on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was the end of the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy was only a complete separation of politics and economy , as a complete separation of politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies since the time , at the time of the separation of politics and economy began , a undes@@ irable struggle between the two , by the economy and the economy . &quot;
do you think why the politicians do not have any more so far as before ?
it is not an analysis of their DNA .
&quot; it lies in the government , and nevertheless not to power , because the power of politics in economy is separated and the areas are separated . &quot;
I have chosen my father with the capitalism .
&quot; if you think it is in about as a her@@ de of noise , the animals , of which they feel , dec@@ im@@ ed at the end . &quot;
&quot; the economic crisis grows as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as the economic growth , and the managing director of the labour market is to invest in cash . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from the democracy , the more than the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; the control reserves , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; the control of the slave , the women and foreig@@ ner . &quot;
this is no new idea .
&quot; the mar@@ x@@ ist Lin@@ ke had already over 100 years , and it was not very good . &quot;
&quot; the teaching from the de@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be to create a position as in the ancient Athens , without new types of gross and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working arms of arms !
&quot; in addition , capitalism does it to be re@@ tained by automation and robotic systems . &quot;
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are independent areas that can be higher , and the social conflicts are deeper , as it was already very soon as I think -- in countries such as China . &quot;
&quot; as a result , we must continue the economy and the areas of economy and policy , and that we will take advantage of a disease , otherwise we can appear in a disease surveillance @-@ auto@@ auto@@ cr@@ ative , which can appear as a documentation of the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
the question is that capitalism has developed the technical characteristics which he has brought to survive -- --
&quot; the most interesting question is to be solved by a D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; the human being in &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; is similar to the human being in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ lon &quot; AG@@ OR@@ A &quot; , &quot; in long periods of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimized .
&quot; how could it look , how could it look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; rather rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ? &quot;
&quot; in the practical implementation I would like to call you in all , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : ask a capital market prior to you , and the company -- no matter what you work , and the company -- no matter where you work in the company , and the company is a property that is currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital , and the concept of wage labour is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; no exception is between whom the companies belong to work and employees who work there , and employees who work there , which the company did not exist between capital and labor , and finally , no restrictions of investment . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : make sure that our national curr@@ encies would have a free pregnant course , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is given by the IMF &#91; International monetary Fund &#93; , in the interest of the whole humanity . &quot;
&quot; we continue to continue that the entire world record in this currency -- we call them &quot; &quot; Kosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the amount to rate the trading income or the trading income of the respective country , in a joint fund . &quot;
&quot; make sure that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world . &quot;
that &apos;s no new idea .
&quot; in fact , what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 . &quot;
the problem was that one could not be the technical means .
&quot; today we saw it , particularly in the background of a re@@ vival policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I am sending you to be at the same time at the same time at the same time at the same time , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in Mül@@ lei@@ mer of history , and key@@ nes@@ ia , global key@@ nes@@ ia . &quot;
but above all other it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
&quot; we are in such a world , &quot;
or will we go into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide .
&quot; it is located in our hands , and we do it better . &quot;
thank you .

&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture you have received Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you have very clear what you are from the point of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democr@@ ats , we have the hearing of a democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on the politics of the area where the most most important , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , when I tell the so @-@ prov@@ oc@@ ative , similar to China today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember how to connect the Liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;

&quot; what you can now see in China , similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;

BG : yes ...
how do you look for six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , made of personal view , and very dis@@ astro@@ us , because we had the opportunity to make the euro with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; therefore , we have to say that a massive reduction of the European Union is threatened by the Eurozone , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to share on the basis of the Greek pre@@ condition -- which was the first proposal , the first proposal was to open it . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continue to be elected . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get a business system , that is not able to get to life by political will and author@@ isation . &quot;
BG : what does it look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any errors in your time as financial ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example ? Y@@ V : any , let &apos;s back -- seriously . ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who had no errors in the ministry , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he doesn &apos;t have a mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I have made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign up for the extension of the debt in the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an ambitious interest on the sites of monetary policy , a common solution . &quot;
but that was not there .
&quot; they wanted to bring only our government , only because they wanted to deal with the financial statements by the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not know that they had been a dis@@ astro@@ us program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominated B@@ IP .
this is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none from the Tro@@ ika of monetary policy , which has imposed us this policy : &quot; that was a colonial mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the conversations , you seem to be right to be right . &quot;
http : / / nullrefer.com / ? https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? V = p@@
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone continues to come from someone , the Europe lives and loves . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro crisis is not over@@ lives .
&quot; for if they don &apos;t live , they will destroy humanity and the European Union . &quot;
&quot; it is not alone for Europe &apos;s dis@@ astro@@ us consequences , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the most important economy in the world .
&quot; when we propose ourselves to the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears , it will be as well as for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , many thanks that you were in China . &quot;

&quot; by Roy Price , most still have never heard , although he probably have been responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very fun , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision by Roy in three years .
Roy Price is advis@@ able at Amazon studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; it is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ heim and describes in Twitter as &quot; films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and the content of the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ struggle industry . &quot;
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
he must find shows that very good are very good .
&quot; in other words , he must find shows the right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review . &quot;
will your show with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then there has a successful show .
&quot; the shows how &quot; Pussy Deluxe &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot;
this type of show .
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should you say that at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not about to get to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle East , the average television -- the shows that is neither good nor bad , they are simply not bad . &quot;
so he needs to ensure that he really is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course , it is also the first time that Amazon as something makes something to risk Roy Price nothing . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs to be guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and discussions with an analysis of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first album of each of these shows and shows them online where they can be free of charge . &quot;

&quot; when you &apos;re going to show you the show , when you &apos;re pau@@ l , which parts of the parts are over@@ turned and again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show it .
&quot; in fact , they collect data , process these and this is the answer ; and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ c US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .

&quot; Alpha House , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show , because they don &apos;t have to remember . &quot;
&quot; it is only a average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve , 7.@@ 4 is the average of this curve due to 7,5 -- so something about the average , but not just what is Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; the name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always on the search to find these a Super @-@ Show , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of a competition with a competition , he and his team will give the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x @-@ viewers , so the reviews , which shows the shows that shows them , etc . &quot;

&quot; when they were all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four must@@ ard , but a drama series of a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , now the question : what is happening here ? &quot;

&quot; they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
&quot; because the logic is somehow , that the logic should work at all . &quot;
&quot; if one sees millions of data , for a decision , the man should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years old as a Back @-@ Up .
it optimized with very powerful computers .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you expect , is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis is not work , it is something special because we live in a time that we live in a time in which we are more and more to statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;

multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever will ever be in touch with this software .
&quot; if someone is interested in the US in prison , and in order , it is probably that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not . &quot;
&quot; but rather than in Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . however , rather to decide whether a show is good or bad will decide whether a person is good or bad . &quot;

&quot; unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
this is not always the best results . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .

&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can say by data analysis of gri@@ ps , which can say , -- by data analysis of Google @-@ research . &quot;
&quot; it was wonderful , and was a great job . the success of success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it was simply not , this was once again a sensor , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the data bases like Amazon and Google , sometimes something else . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data collected in decisions of life is a -- at the workplace , at the right time in medicine . &quot;
therefore we should ensure that data are helpful .
&quot; however , I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gene@@ tics -- a country where some very clever people un@@ used many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have seen some patterns of the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions .
&quot; do you need to solve a complex problem , you are mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a complete set of this problem you can analyze this problem in its details , so you can analyze the details of the details . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are two things : apart and again . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to meet the parts again and then be able to come to a transfer .
there is a different tool and we are all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something else , when the brain is good , it is the parts and pieces again , even if the information is un@@ complete , so if it is the brain of a experts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have shared data and mind where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience , what they do not have been able to understand what they are not able to understand . but the decision , how to take all these parts , go back and take a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which did not go into the data . &quot;

&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first , as it was as &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could say , &quot; &quot; that say us the data . &quot;
it led not to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think that things can be done if data are to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful them are , data are only a tool , and to forget that device is pretty useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before it was , this is the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is amazing . the Magic 8 Ball is called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or No question you need to get a reply to get a reply . &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;

I have decided to hear some decisions in my life and I had to hear some decisions in my life .
&quot; however , such as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace these through something much easier , such as data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic design .
&quot; in the end , the ball had to reach the ball , and became the ball . finally , it is possible to meet decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I see this as very encouraging message that it is to be able to meet decisions , and to make decisions that you can do and risks to risks . &quot;
&quot; for the end we are not the data , but the risks that you are at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you so much .
