<seg id="2">"they know him, because he won as New York Times-Reporter's Pulitzer Prize."</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before any one of Edward Snowden heard, Risen wrote a book, in which he heard a book, in which he heard the NSA's telephones."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this case, he describes a disastrophal US intelligence officer, in which the CIA the Iran has literally overturned into force for a nuclear bombing."</seg>

<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not have to do?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government against Risen was determined and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he was to condemn the symbol for the pattern of the government, Whistleblower, and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the Media has the right to publish a secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to get this right if media will not get any information about this information, and if they cannot protect it."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so as the government in Risen ankloom, he did not know what many mute reporters have already said before him, he said that he would have to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen's risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, it was a little outside."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were not essential for their case, the demands of the government would fall."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic control, the reporter and sources will always be less expensive."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of edible and risky to the statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, the investigations shall be punished without his redemption, his telephony had been worried,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as such as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they use used to Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and risking source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama said to protect him, Whistlebless, but instead, the justice more condemned than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now, you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since the 11th of September, almost every article about national security is the result of that a Whistleblower than one journalists."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we set the press work on the game which are being protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has always been more possibilities to help everyone else."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but as such as technology of the government allows the rights of reporments, the press can use technologies to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and yet, they can be seen from the moment in which they come to contact, rather than in the night."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that there are not yet been written, as Risen is written, and it is much safer than normal email or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is Securesis, an open source analysis system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet of the internet, which was developed by us from the internet of the Press Foundation, which was developed by us."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of a e-mail to send e-mail, go to a News Site, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can change documents or information, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then encrypt the encrypted and stored on a server.</seg>
<seg id="35">"therefore, the government cannot see more information, and many of the information that they don't know, would not be available."</seg>
