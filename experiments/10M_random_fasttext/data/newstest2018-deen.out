a hor@@ de of boat land@@ lords and @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have happened to him when he had done it .
&quot; but he handle their meaning , and especially the meaning that you have written as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the thought . &quot;
&quot; as an artist A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I will not be on a complete thing about history , but the Free Revolution is ... a symbol of American freedom , which is the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , on which you have been added , and not part of the original tour of the city . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; it goes to the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus , the only one , in which a state not only exist in the state , but the sleeves of the poor : &quot;
&quot; there were never a time to see , in which the &quot; el@@ ites &quot; on our screens was better . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On September 3 , 2011 &gt; 9 &quot; &quot; Tablets &quot;
&quot; in fact , the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural heritage : it is in fact a conflict in fact a conflict in America . &quot;
&quot; Laz@@ arus - and their friends , who had to place their words according to her death at the base - did not know that they had a high political action . &quot;
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , by taking them into a different classic picture of the freedom of freedom of freedom . &quot;
&quot; Laz@@ arus has changed these importance : in their poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice . &quot;
&quot; and they are a very different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a ver@@ he@@ ed attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Laz@@ arus the significance of the statue , wanted to change people from the right wing this . &quot;
&quot; the large part of the Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the com@@ men of Tr@@ ump , argued , but rather a early @-@ conservative world , the American Flam@@ me in the um@@ ined world : &quot; Lady Knight goes online . &quot;
it should be the F@@ ack@@ el of the freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el should not be the way to the United States .
&lt; ! -- Start WOWSlider.com HEAD section -- &gt;
the significance of the statue is quite different and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the vast majority of Laz@@ arus was in fact , they see how they had seen by the exhaus@@ tive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble travels on the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
it is possible to see the world from people to see the world from the perspective of people who are cur@@ sed and a chance to improve your life .
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome , which they have to hear . &quot;
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; her F@@ ack@@ el should not go the way , but the sun that is her only source of power , ign@@ ite its only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ osing Scottish members of the United Kingdom
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time , than just two gravel to the team of the Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; the performance of the athletes of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ kö@@ ves@@ icles in the world championship is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that will be opened on Friday .
&quot; in this case , Black believes in Scotland is something special , and the lightweight chemistry of the United Kingdom is something to learn . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will find it , until we &apos;ll need to figure out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has done something to do what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has done something to do what they have done .
&quot; if you have any queries , please log in using your e @-@ mail address and your password . : &quot;
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; what is the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ alli@@ ed , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - the against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track of the team , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle , was elected by the team of the team &apos;s team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her son speech was unbeliev@@ able , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very motivated and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling of the E@@ ili@@ d@@ h , of course were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal in which the world champion@@ ships in the world &apos;s world champion@@ ships at 400 meters , says that it &apos;s incredible &quot; is that 16 gravel in the British team are . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s biggest total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Mu@@ ir goes on this way and has set up the last year five British and two European integration . &quot;
they will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m , is a further Sch@@ otte , one of a great season , which should be seen after a great season that should observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Book Games . &quot;
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; the Mann@@ ish Church says that they are very proud of the fact that many of their country is not only to the team , but in some cases are also part of the med@@ als and at the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thanks to team @-@ chapters , it is that it has been chosen by the other members of the team , so that it has been a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ put for me , and I have chosen to have something special for me , added to me . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the gravel , which belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we come .
&quot; and they are here as well , athletes , athletes who want to get on the podium . &quot;
what is my speech ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I think that we have very happy that we have very happy with this situation because we have a home world .
&quot; thus , it is really important to do this home support and that we will benefit from the Olympiast@@ adion . &quot;
&quot; I have a second chance to go there , and to compete and it will be just a great atmosphere as well . &quot;

&quot; he was also very happy to use Facebook as a pri@@ ming means to connect with its vot@@ ers , and play@@ able to use his beloved head to chem@@ otherapy at its side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block of persons that come on the side of the Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs - a public forum is called , and by employees who are paid with public tax income - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Hog@@ an Proph@@ ec@@ in Amel@@ ia CH@@ AS@@ SE the actions of the Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs and argued that the block of the comments are no further than a Moder@@ ation . &quot;

&quot; and that are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a entrepren@@ eur and a parish , no T@@ role . &quot;

&quot; I said that I was disappointed that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ le@@ v and other current news , &quot; &quot; wrote it in the comments &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I think this idea is not even if a number of people at the same topic , they will be recognized by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use , and not as a great group of offices . &quot;

but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although they remain free on free foot , the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the entire city was well known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Ober@@ est Court of Justice in Georgia to give the first time to enter the first time in the summer of the summer . &quot;

&quot; when it comes to it , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared the Mor@@ de , and defined them , &quot; includes a FBI Report . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that there was a Complete between the State and local Criminal Court , which was not only to the mor@@ ality , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it as pre@@ ventive .
&quot; it was a election right of mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoffmann satisfied with the result , would not be the two areas of the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; there were two areas on a lot , and we need to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the Ab@@ sin@@ ner of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erzgebirge , the triple chain can also be optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a free turn , the Fort@@ una can &apos;t stop anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also take the experience in preparation with the triple chain , as with the four chain chain . &quot;
&quot; even though , I don &apos;t like to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Ste@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure to be sure , &quot; &quot; because we are in the triple chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ aul@@ elmann players , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;

&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; radio and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e may even be some fresh , as they could not have a serious and complete game like Fort@@ una against a lift off in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the Interior office of the Fort@@ una . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in 432 , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may possibly be found under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is placed in question .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency , are the results for the last months of months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the last months , the numbers are rather constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not imp@@ ly that the asylum seek@@ ers over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency used the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that the under@@ went to the person of 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ mar@@ es the 581 published results , presented them that in 243 of these cases the person had been open in this year 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , in the X @-@ ray photos of wisdom and M@@ RT @-@ recordings of knee joints , which is analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , also in some areas . &quot;

&quot; I had reason to think about thinking , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age on this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; when we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could do it , &quot; he said the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the Foren@@ sic Medicine Agency reserves the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in fact if the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;

&quot; Barcelona has $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) , to buy the Brazilian bottom from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received by several ten million dollars per year . &quot;

FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UE@@ FA President in 2007 .
&quot; on the other hand , the former French player believed that she had enormous interest to success on success , effective and risk to ru@@ in@@ ating when banks or share their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P from the concentration on the deb@@ tor is based on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model was originally posted in Chelsea , a club with potential customers and to improve the team to improve the team and to build a global brand - to a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P acquisition period , up to 2018 , the clubs are losses in height of 30 million euros . &quot;

&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G together with Abu D@@ hab@@ i , which took place in Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a monetary policy of 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which was later on 20 million euros , and it was limited to the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 on 21 players instead of the normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UE@@ FA is based on the search for Klu@@ bs , who could try their financial supervision by companies which are connected with the owners of a clubs , which are connected to the owners of a clubs . &quot;
&quot; during an electronic company the PS@@ G needs , if the value of the sponsor@@ ings should exceed the default market , the UE@@ FA should not be considered as part of income taxes . &quot;
&quot; to the end of 2014 , the UE@@ FA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ings of the PSA to be moved to Qatar &apos;s value . &quot;
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments on N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the organisation Committee of the World 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have seen that N@@ ey@@ mar World War will be easy to find out that N@@ ey@@ mar World War will be easy to find out .
&quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UE@@ FA is still working on the UE@@ FA , that the UE@@ FA still has to consider every attempt to deal with rules . &quot;
&quot; the UE@@ FA had no proven conversations with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said to discuss under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they did not have to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million Euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .

studies have shown that pre@@ p the HIV transfer of infection is significantly reduced significantly .
pre@@ p before sexual inter@@ course means that just enough medicines in the body is present to prevent a HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual inter@@ course .

we welcome this announcement .
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be carried out that the study is rapidly in the whole country , and that no one who has a risk for HIV has left . &quot;
&quot; now , since the pre@@ p test medicine , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;

this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important to protect this study as quickly as possible in the whole country , to protect people to protect the HIV @-@ infected , and that they have to become a step closer to society . &quot;

&quot; among the latter , you can choose from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , and Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;

Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .

&quot; but at the theme of Val@@ dez , there are practically no matter . &quot;
&quot; during the last year and the delivery in the United States in January was s@@ alo@@ a to one of the blu@@ ish battle@@ fields of the country , since it was to fill the vacuum to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; there is nothing out of that in Sin@@ hal@@ a every day someone or several people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of space , two of the two of two people who are larger than many houses for the living room . &quot;
&quot; for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; , &quot; if only a number of Kartell made the control over the co@@ st@@ enst@@ a@@ at with its precious ports and drugs trading in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez is aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with whom he had broken his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , one who guide one of the rival cart@@ ons in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
these publication may have taken the sons of the sons of each copy of each copy of the issue as soon as it was restored .
&quot; the second error occurred in Val@@ dez , to force the same story to leave the same story to leave the land to his own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his daughters will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
&quot; he had so long lives that his friends and colleagues are informed , that he would be always . &quot;
&quot; he was in 2003 as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he started with five colleagues at the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , and 50 US dollars shares . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalist , without having passed on the noise problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper were a call for the mu@@ te and ambitious reporting , and the sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orter loved it , hard to publish the investigations without fear of c@@ ensu@@ s , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read anything else . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez the &apos; International Press Award Award &quot; Committee on the protection of journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Asian American history . &quot;

din@@ osau@@ rs users used to carry out his enemies
&quot; on the first sight , it looks like a statue when also a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian Berg@@ man who have received experts as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well , that they couldn &apos;t find that his wife &apos;s skin from red@@ dish brown was - and they said , they would have something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; presented him as &quot; &quot; the be@@ asts of Din@@ osau@@ rs , the ever found , and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs catalog of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ mann who lived in the middle of the circle @-@ time between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his incredibly good condition , researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the arm@@ oured plant nur@@ ses the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; he met on something what the surrounding rocks went on to the Plat@@ ze , and the loss of thought . &quot;
&quot; from him , F@@ ossi@@ l was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ä@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; they brought the next six years , the wild beast within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the finished result is ready to be found . &quot;
&quot; if you only need a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that there is the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the Kre@@ ator is to see . &quot;
&quot; as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs catalog , the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ auri@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant nur@@ ses , although he covered with a arm@@ ament and a wall tanks , probably from the flesh of Din@@ os@@ auri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the strongly arm@@ ored Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white Tar@@ gets to hide from space , and used a waste technology that is known as a counter@@ part , which is also known by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to handle better in its surroundings and its enemies , to say that it was threatened by the larger Din@@ os@@ auri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was made in May for the first time , and now is now in Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; researchers have now been studied by the wild animals and the Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum@@ st@@ allion Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ .000 hours that has been carefully . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Mitchell and a international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of shoes and arm@@ rests on his body . &quot;
&quot; they discover the con@@ sh@@ aking , a widespread defense method in the animal , which means that the tip of the creature was as their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ elling is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was over@@ flowing by the today &apos;s living animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure caused by the flesh of din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the accounts of the con@@ front@@ al as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals who use the con@@ dol@@ ences - think of R@@ before , z@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are a lot of small and dangerous than sp@@ inning , that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong sound behaviour on a massive , strong Din@@ osau@@ rs , such as dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ animals of the circle @-@ time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its skel@@ eton shows that the skin of the Din@@ os@@ auri@@ ers red brown was made .
&quot; scientists agree on its life , including its con@@ ical intest@@ ine to find out what it is known as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the Din@@ osau@@ rs , as he died , in a river , and into the sea , where he died on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta was so warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oc@@ eans probably as much more land@@ ed than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because he remains completely covered with con@@ ical skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of the Tier@@ es said , &quot; Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost as good as in the early circle .
&quot; they do not use much imagination to use it . if you only look a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the circle @-@ time was a time , as a huge ther@@ op@@ posing , gr@@ aci@@ di@@ ers Din@@ os@@ auri@@ ere , which went on two legs , the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the arm@@ ored Din@@ osau@@ rs was created by some of his fur@@ y ancestors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy Monster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest insights into the trade journal Current Events , believe Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea , and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the Kre@@ ative was found by Sha@@ wn radio , as he started on 21 March 2011 in S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the be@@ zel of the world , including the skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the sn@@ ail to the hip . &quot;
&quot; during the average of 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long , up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; the two 20 inch long heads , which from his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ren@@ aissance plant nur@@ ses through the Western Canada , up to a over@@ flowing river it &apos;s open to the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater service of the Din@@ os@@ auri@@ ers keep his arm@@ or to exquisite item Show details .
&quot; the top remains of this special copy are so well , that the house is still still hol@@ iness , along the Din@@ os@@ auri@@ ers along the Din@@ os@@ auri@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , a level of the preservation is so rare as a profit in Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it before , the more conf@@ using it . &quot;
the skin of the skin is still the hol@@ ly tank to wear the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right hand is on his side , his five fingers are moved to top . &quot;

&quot; they observed a live chat , which was a group of demonstr@@ ators before a group of demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I will kill you , &quot; &quot; I will kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; says Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have used to have , and we are typical . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I felt shame . &quot;
I was w@@ üt@@ sed and w@@ ept .

&quot; after the landing at 23 : 00 , her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of their father , and decided that the two next morning after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what is in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cin@@ em@@ as from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and the Protest@@ ant , the love and the loss of strength that is able to live in the community , and the streets are filled with answers to answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with their daughter , a flower flower , and a matching crown of crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , pra@@ yed the two a conversation that she had a lot of times before this morning , which she had lots of experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you may only be aware of how I have taught you when black people have to fight , how they believe ? &quot; &quot; they heard it , what they said . &quot;
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; I could not take it , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what is happening today is a cli@@ max of what is happening in the past .
you need to know and see it .
&quot; she needs to know well , not only active and organization but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do free to save us yourself . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give you a experience , when they do not have an ec@@ lip@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different as the next black women child . &quot;
I have the feeling that I would like to keep a bad service to keep them .
&quot; the first station , when she was in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on ank@@ ees , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , one place towards the police officer who was named to a camp , as the activists in a camp , as the activists &apos;s possible non @-@ Prosec@@ utor &apos;s possible non @-@ accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; there are fer@@ rell and their daughter with a local business owner , at lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves them at the demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of activity for fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activity is changed after the 9th of August total , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the member student Nur@@ ses Association , and itself on essence of justice and health prec@@ au@@ tions in black communities . &quot;
I had no experience in the organisms .
it &apos;s all come .
&quot; later , Fer@@ tility during a evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; finally , Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her husband Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r was just a matter of matter what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; if you want to find a history , you can use a story that you can use it ? &quot;
&quot; this skel@@ ep@@ sis has been reduced by many cases of humans , often from wheat - in a community that was set up by their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as fol@@ ly recently published in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who have been born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , and grew up their voices and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the field which is known for his activity . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought to Fer@@ rell the project , together with six other people followed the team of &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose m@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be displayed , because so I will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it comes to a Messi@@ ah leader , but to show a community that comes together in the film . &quot;
&quot; in order to show the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; personal aspects of fer@@ mentation lives , such as they like in love and her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and he , when they saw the finished product to the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain role in this work and in the human being of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ le history the role of the black s@@ ander women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ movement movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founder of the movement , after the pot@@ ting of the black teen@@ agers of Martin in 2012 the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ thood &quot; in social media , identify themselves as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried out the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly working on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
black and pregnant women have to wear the main load of all .
&quot; finally , the movement really enjoyed the movement really from black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; it is however , that &quot; this does not mean that &quot; this does not have to have an inter@@ oper@@ able type of action &quot; , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell because of their identity as heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who said this energy was , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although she was at the front front , because at a life of this cruise as a black , pregnant woman as much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the broad@@ band eras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on long gone , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police . &quot;

from the last 30 days from the last 30 days from the last 30 days
there are already enough results in our city .
you can see how many store shops are empty here - some since months and years .
&quot; at the same time , however , there is more important that we will receive at least the Mark@@ thalle . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the goods offered the goods of fresh , will be offered directly from the owners and is ob@@ end@@ able . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , shop shops in a shopping centre is rented only by larger companies , for the dor@@ mit@@ ories are often not tragic . &quot;
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( TV )
&quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle for me not together . &quot;
and the gallery fits not to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the peasant market during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration when the bit @-@ Gallery is actually actually .
or creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit @-@ Gallery already before all the shops made from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , that is empty , also no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view it would be better to promote a proper farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market , I have no place to know what I find - sensu@@ ous construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place more . &quot;
&quot; if the peasant market is broken , it will disappear to a piece of culture . &quot;

&quot; in the middle of the room the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are a lot of faces - white , black and brown , which is almost un@@ happy - which is in the middle of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were killed by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem , which were sent by Chelsea M@@ anning . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning sent to the prison sentence from the prison of Fort Worth , where the former secret service analysis is a 35 @-@ year prison sentence on the website of the web @-@ speaking countries . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is a B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similar ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline their competence in technology , computer science and art . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could be interpreted as someone with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways , as they are interpreted as they are interpreted as they are interpreted as they are created . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but already since its pu@@ ber@@ ty was open to the identification of the wife , including six promises against the Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison was her picture , so much that there was only a single photo - a gr@@ n@@ ly , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning is un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ ak Per@@ wig is also associated with them . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg are just right from the big success of their 2012 project &quot; &quot; Vis@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to produce a picture of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ ical sc@@ ef@@ aces such as cigar@@ ett@@ ingen and Kau@@ ro , by using the DNA from the case , to produce a picture like this people could look like this . &quot;
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail by a newspaper magazine .
&quot; she was a interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while she wanted to accompany these articles , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not yet visited this time , and she could not be reminded by this time , they took place with Chelsea on and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her in@@ haf@@ ated M@@ use were killed in Bri@@ eff@@ re@@ es , which were included in the course of two years of letters . &quot;
&quot; you are even able to see one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who would like to see a future prior to the president of Chel@@ ten@@ i , and she would be able to see the exhibition in personally . &quot;

&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange Tim@@ ing from all these things , they said that &quot; things come from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning with their over@@ sized signature among the &quot; &quot; i &quot; in their family name ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is a end of the &quot; automatic wat@@ ts , whose foundation generation , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA Sequ@@ ence - a thousands of Cs from Cs and G@@ s and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg says , thanks to the importance of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ is@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific studies of the artist ) , how much similar to at least in bi@@ polar circumstances we all are . &quot;
&quot; in fact , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , who are not responsible for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , track record Mem@@ ories . &quot;
DNA @-@ data can tell many different stories that are the 30 of these stories .
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is placed in an own space , is one side of the above mentioned film @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows how they come with a free speech of the United States of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if your speech is cold , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so don &apos;t never know the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she has written , &quot; &quot; said the artist , which is from Philadelphia . &quot;

&quot; in the middle of the room , the exhibition was still not personally seen - so as it should be done in the middle of the room from the mas@@ ks , by their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ations , which is related to the prot@@ otypes of prot@@ otypes . &quot;
&quot; this was also important , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings st@@ ature ) , which were written in its genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I wanted to feel at the wall , but I wanted to feel like a man amount of man , said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg from the por@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement , how the movement , even behind their liberation . &quot;

&quot; as a Rho@@ des of a decade later , the employee is just to care about the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years ago , in which Arist@@ ok@@ ers said to &quot; &quot; Oh , set it on the roof floor . &quot;

&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to move on wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which is the newly built castle next to close to the front of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a recording , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ ight@@ ly Famili@@ es of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area , and I thought it was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ?
&quot; other stories are fixed in the history of the Castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jes@@ u@@ iten@@ pat@@ ers who tells the family of Dar@@ rell seven years long during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the sm@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell out of the 18th century , which was filled with stones ( a discovery that was later made ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are a Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the Men &apos;s Singles W@@ aun@@ er is to be deb@@ ated and money for things that they could not be . &quot;
&quot; another generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men in the midst of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men , by using them on old women , I imagine to see me as a h@@ aufen with a talent in order to manage them . &quot;
&quot; after the end of its application it is Rho@@ des on the search for other unique background experience , &quot;
&quot; he has had a two @-@ w@@ reck stay in the Finnish Wil@@ derness for a friend @-@ novel about El@@ ss@@ inian Monastery from the early 20th century , which has been returned from the nature back . &quot;
but Scot@@ ch has a special place for him .

so this week .
&quot; on the first glance , a normal process . &quot;
but nothing is routine about the Turkish military forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting took place in the building of the General Assembly instead , as before , but in the official residence of the world . &quot;

this was the Zi@@ vi@@ lists in the Y@@ as in the over@@ speed .
the government has a military force in the army .
&quot; at the same time , there is no need to be able to find out more than one million people in the world . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p has a state of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art plant , 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and Admir@@ al channels . &quot;

you have to be logged in to write a review .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robots ) ( FR@@ R ) a report about the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ igration professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield , and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take its Ascen@@ sion . &quot;
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; the people do not know about them , but the company deliver every lot of them , and we will get much more frequently to see more frequently to see Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have been developed by their infl@@ atable partners with a silicone gel that feels warm - with consciously human reactions to be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user may be able to adjust its robots even in accordance with his beliefs , as well as the eye color of the robot , to the type of the chest , or the colour of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it is still un@@ lucky , since many robot the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; have come to play a step@@ ford woman who would look like a step@@ ford woman . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ o have developed a robot with a silicone gel .
the Real@@ m robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties that can be easier to make it easier for example .
&quot; and then there are some of the True Story of Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots with pre@@ programmed person@@ alities like &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; , &quot; the impression of how &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; , &quot; the impression of how &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as well as possible .
&quot; so don &apos;t like what you like , and they don &apos;t like you like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , their voice will also show their voice - quite like real people ! &quot;
it can be tired on con@@ vers@@ ation or she can be in mood .
&quot; there are many be@@ eke@@ eping aspects in this Ascen@@ sion - not least because they replace a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d , but the underground female attributes that you have a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; on its website , the True Story of Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can &apos;t have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;

&quot; their origin and their increasing Raff@@ in@@ ance , on some dun@@ es and ti@@ ques in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of the equality of gender equality . &quot;
&quot; most men are of course of course no sex robot , and during the FR@@ R their increasing popularity , they remain unchanged at the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what out of the ver@@ teb@@ rates , it can live in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or a strange , up to them of the free market . &quot;
&quot; however , there are a certain beliefs that these high @-@ developed sex robot can play in a time , in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened to have the rights of women worldwide . &quot;
&quot; the terrible aspect of the television series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the ver@@ itable body and the sto@@ cked eyes , but how realistic this vision . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a book , but at the moment it feels like a great deal . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind this sex robot consists in a physical presence of actual women as well as technically possible ( if also with porno@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) . &quot;
they want to feel that they feel the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robot no real women . &quot;
you can &apos;t stop by their companion or simply walk .
&quot; they have no influence or a background history , nothing , what to independence or ir@@ gen@@ cies , what the imagination could cause the imagination . &quot;
&quot; in other words , you are ple@@ aded slaves . &quot;
or to press it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 :
what do you think ?
&quot; as a result , the long @-@ term impact of healthy human rights &quot;
&quot; it is to a Bin@@ sen@@ sh@@ eit of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political sp@@ ans who have the US vot@@ ers have played the US vot@@ ers , even families in small format . &quot;
&quot; in the US newspapers , there was a lot of Christmas and Ern@@ est in the US Newspap@@ ers , how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump sel@@ ections . &quot;

I have chosen this because my C@@ ous@@ ine who lives in Chicago lives and has visited this week in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know that the unity of a common enemy may have a powerful effect . &quot;
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows that they knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with whom they had been fighting , suddenly , and quite different on the same page . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it is certainly a good thing that this is also significant risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the Lin@@ ke was removed from Tr@@ ump , but the ent@@ able effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to kill us all of the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak out of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ass@@ le opportunity that we will not take a day out of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a long @-@ time cross @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump of the right flights . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I can &apos;t see me from an active No@@ stal@@ gie on the car - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % of income tax ( but at least , we know how his tax haven &apos;t saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild hos@@ tile . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is , the next candidate must take only mentally healthy to quali@@ fy as undes@@ irable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my C@@ ous@@ ine in the city , we spent our children to car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , and the best of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York City department , and the best three dollars that you can use in the city . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder , all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ py . &quot;
&quot; so many cli@@ sch@@ ees of a city is dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; one of thirty years later , and I am still not over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not only - but a large round@@ about in the north of Lon@@ d@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 years . &quot;
&quot; when I had to rate the car@@ us@@ her , I would have a full score , but fortunately no one has been asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to withdraw my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee table on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the load . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a slower exchange of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also pressure on the server to bring your personality into a situation . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was de@@ pressed , while I tired of experience , you made my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; if the balance bike is far off into the inflammation , it can cause an anti @-@ infl@@ ated intest@@ ine results . &quot;
in experiments it was noted that a type of tolerance of tolerance is applied at m@@ ite , which is a certain bacter@@ ium in their hearts . &quot;
&quot; the bacteria , Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks from prot@@ ector to the appearance of the cells . &quot;
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial machine - Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous and the development of a population of cells which promote tolerance .
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the m@@ lice in their food , the more they had come from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he sm@@ iled , that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i , and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han &apos;s nutrition toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal mili@@ eux , when the same system is also in humans . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an sought a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance than they found out that a group of study of study such cells , but a other group of young species that had been separated , but it was separated . &quot;
&quot; she said that the difference is to do with the intestinal micro@@ organisms , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , normally in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
there were six bacteria that were found in the mouth with the immune cells which were present in the mouth with the immune cells .
&quot; in a ster@@ il@@ en environment , so that they were not developed in a ster@@ il@@ en environment , and they were not developed by the immun@@ ity of immune cells and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how to understand the bacteria on the immune system , the researchers of L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and over@@ turned the small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to in@@ complete immune cells which were isolated from the m@@ alt@@ ation . &quot;
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it was known as a previous product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ aboli@@ sm , which is known as in@@ toxic@@ ity @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ estone acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers found the amount of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the p@@ aci@@ di@@ ous , the number of such cells um around 50 per cent , but the number of cells around the half of the cells around half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an stated that people have the same toler@@ able cells like m@@ lice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not well known if Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ camp products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans as well as in m@@ ite , but defic@@ its in casting in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in G@@ yp@@ top@@ han . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to control because these cells can control the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potential customers can lead to potential customers in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to extend their population .

&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event at the 17th of July in the White House . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and CEO of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , helic@@ opter was presented to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;

&quot; it sounds like you are closed , &quot; &quot; answered the vo@@ iced command@@ ment . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was covered by the White House as a official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch .
but also official events have a political issue .
&quot; on the event , the president has appointed an agreement for the reform of health care , which was the Senate in the pit , and he called the efforts to the establishment of the government . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;

H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no Bud@@ get@@ ing for the presi@@ dency and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the US military court for the household year 2017 , the Do@@ D leader for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit the flight time of the air@@ plane as 30 minutes from the home basis of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Sites in Virginia .
&quot; the White House is found , that the real costs for operation of the helic@@ op@@ ters are far under this rate . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the tax burden on the basis of the estimates , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; they include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press release of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and State Connec@@ tic@@ ut is very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds of thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
&quot; and I think , as most Americans are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment that have worked so many Americans have worked . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is naturally necessary to lift . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear that Tr@@ ump with the helic@@ opter parts , when he finished his tour on the South La@@ wn for the event of the event , but he sat down into the driver &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump of representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , and ste@@ ep@@ ed with the media over its own fleet of company products . &quot;

&quot; in the report , there is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , so that it can be used by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it was the best known for the first time . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other coatings , many victims of the general alleg@@ ations of R. and therefore , therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Ez@@ emann , why the final report will be of mis@@ er@@ able at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Ez@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; prec@@ inc@@ tion of violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; there are many students from his &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the same time he also appears as Ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfection , which was called the Ö@@ f@@ teren , if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you use this report ?
&quot; Michael Hay@@ den : if one sees the effort and the whole 440 sides of the front end , one must ask why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at the same time . &quot;
&quot; and he will be dedicated to eight sides , and he will be clear by any promises of the centre or co @-@ thought of sexual abuse . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , the violence begins to take a closer look at the beginning of the school . &quot;

&quot; I have never been able to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; he was not very embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the true problem of sexual abuse was , and is that most victims from shame . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , the report to the very clear result : &quot; that it was not confirmed in the context of the law and / or their environment in the context of investigation . &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is responsible for sexual abuse .
&quot; in this way , it is not easy to be thrown , it doesn &apos;t prevents him or to send it to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ tions , as it wasn &apos;t in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
do you have any questions ?
&quot; Michael Williams : that &apos;s a great problem that was missing in the coverage of all , and went to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is again a abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; as it is clean , clean : between the school and the holiday of Dom@@ sp@@ ades , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , others , others , others . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report had been treated from time since 1945 , that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the domain . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ fying test education , cases , in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cking teachers , which have been pre@@ dominant in which the school of the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ etches have to do . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is nothing to do , for he was only to face the boys , when they were already on the domain . &quot;
&quot; on that , as the most of witnesses , the topic &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; it was only happy that you come to be , and the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ ison &quot; . &quot; &quot;
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium ?
&quot; Ez@@ ra : there were a lot of discipline , but there were no sa@@ di@@ mentary violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with the report to the end , that &quot; many victims of the general crimes of R. I. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , it remains not to be allowed to have to have gone away . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all efforts , the report only have to define two periods of time in which he was reported on the pre @-@ school school . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish a school , and he was not responsible and responsible . &quot;

&quot; in view of the danger of negative results , he moved to the danger of the danger of negative results . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time , as a legal statement , as a testing of testing also in Bavaria . &quot;

&quot; it was also for him for him hard to say , where the decision might be over@@ ly or dramatic , and where really the remaining limit was exce@@ eded . &quot;
you can &apos;t say that he would always have gone away .

&quot; but that is of course not for sexual abuse , who was born to all times , and not for what is happening in the school of contradic@@ tions and violence . &quot;
that &apos;s all very horri@@ ble and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I have Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means to the disciplines and best , so o@@ hr@@ ined and ears to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 19@@ 70@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; as a physical exercise , it is forbidden to be kept at all . &quot;
&quot; what the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger period has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for the discussions with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Michael Hay@@ den : now , in the book , it &apos;s the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ c@@ ts X@@ VI@@ s , tells him from his perspective , as played the domain . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not think that it was a strict reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; however , that must also be said : without this experience of world @-@ related discipline , it would have hardly possible to forms a institution from pupp@@ ets to forms , real culture of Europe and his musical tradition , the same twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with K@@ ek@@ sen and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , it &apos;s not a great singer and before every success , at which the area , but always discipline , passion and self . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of people , you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the conversations of her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hay@@ den : through the work on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well as wonderful , hum@@ or@@ ful , land , deep gl@@ aci@@ ties and heart@@ y people , of which one can &apos;t imagine that he could not be able to do anything else . &quot;
&quot; I am regularly with how many former domain names today , 23 years after his Em@@ igration , and regularly visit him that he is almost blind and him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; but those who do not forgive him until today , he was not given to them , so that he was clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the domain names are grateful to him that he has enrich@@ ed their lives and to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always has a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ry teacher - a str@@ ingent father , but it may be a great respect to them , but also a great respect to them today . &quot;
&quot; and please , even more : all that you are pre@@ aching , education methods that were at the same time at the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have been able to overcome these time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ ambig@@ uous , a man , only because he has died , and a little brother , to make the medi@@ al sin@@ king . &quot;
&quot; it is the evil intention that stands behind it , just too much . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was published , un@@ load him . &quot;
&quot; now , there would be a 93 @-@ year man who has acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who did not know that the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral would know , finally in peace . &quot;
