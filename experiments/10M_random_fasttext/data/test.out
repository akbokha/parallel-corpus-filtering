&quot; in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP , we want to prevent both Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the two US presidential candidates will be able to deal with the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic request . &quot;
&quot; the difference between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the State of the State .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt , and war@@ fare , as the state of economy can occur - with taxes and regul@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Clinton says the economy to death and to death , says he says . &quot;

&quot; in this way , he will take part in a long @-@ term tax reform with lower tax burden , for private individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has a certain tasks to fulfil specific tasks , he has to be able to open a profit opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would be increased . &quot;
&quot; in addition , both are very close to the theme infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in that case , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost updated . &quot;

the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump wants to build the coal power plants and the coal industry in the USA .
oil promotion should be possible to be able to take part in a protected areas of the Paris climate protection .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to increase the renewable energies and calls : &quot; a country will be the Super@@ vision of the clean energies and millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ d trade agreement , do not want to use both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the US hasn &apos;t been able to protect them from international trade , but simply only American jobs . &quot;
this will then be better paid for about Clinton .

&quot; in this question , he says : &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; he says : the minimum wages must be changed , then he says he does not change . &quot;
&quot; however , the great discussion of the coming months will probably develop the tax policy of the two warehouse . &quot;
&quot; on the one side , Tr@@ ump , who wants the economy and the citizens want to attack the growth . &quot;

&quot; on the other side there is Clinton , at least from the rich , that they say more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;

&quot; it is not to say , &quot; &quot; each woman who comes here , has made her own experiences with sexual violence . &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men fle@@ e because of wars , because they are political , or death , or the death , or because their families them as their hopes for Europe , &quot; he tells them . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons for the flight : &quot; many years ago , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
&quot; in their hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence . &quot;
this is one of the most important aspects of the world .

&quot; for example , for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a sel@@ dom &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they will not be protected from their families . &quot;
&quot; he who believe that this , once they come into Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , women in refugee camps often have often seen as min@@ der@@ ous and worst cases . &quot;
&quot; this leads to that about 90 per cent of women who dwell in the Munich north , there are space @-@ friendly . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are safe , not volun@@ tar@@ ily . &quot;
many women are so usual that they don &apos;t say nothing .
or they do not know about the experience because the sheep is too big .
&quot; as it is often not to help others , who need more accommodation only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district reig@@ ns for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether it is possible from a similar project like in Munich in its state area , answer some with No . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Upper Fran@@ conia , there are so something in accommodation of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in weak@@ nesses , women are not separated by women , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ enting the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bayern , Lower and Middle Fran@@ conia is there in some shared areas or own houses only for children and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on the &quot; rights of the woman and equality of gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament , that women are separated separated by men . &quot;
&quot; in a study that is called &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separated . &quot;
&quot; missing the privacy or , men and women together , it can come to violence against women . &quot;
&quot; all rooms are separated , separated and for women are easily accessible , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much of the women of this protective needs , you can read it on the house in Munich . &quot;

&quot; he was rejected by 58 % of its members , who have been involved in the elections . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday on Twitter , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court that the government &apos;s government has been found that the government was rejected by the treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; what has the J@@ DC Management , the proposed new contract is complete with the proposed new treaty and official new negotiations . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today has a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to become a leading programme of the B@@ MA Council , the beginning of September begins . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the B@@ MA Assistant Professor Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election of the agreed contractual conditions , which were recommended by the B@@ MA recommended . &quot;
&quot; he made B@@ MA members during the seat that were still interested in the vote by 54@@ ,000 assistance and medical studies , with that the contract is beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; according to the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England will be introduced in England . &quot;
&quot; Russia and Turkey : a &quot; &quot; Alliance of Spre@@ ader &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands of the hands and a official end of the eight months long ago of the words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but as Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Peters@@ burger Pal@@ ast@@ es , I can not agree with it , that An@@ kara do not want to work in most cases . &quot;
&quot; there were the hand@@ maid , yes . &quot;
&quot; however , Put@@ ins was very small , and he couldn &apos;t find warmth , even for his back conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , told by his &quot; love friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
&quot; he said that the relations of Russia is not only on its old level before the crisis , but even even better . &quot;
&quot; on the next day , a newspaper that the earth would have had been done so far as it would never happen . &quot;
he seemed to be the opposite of his enthusiasm .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia was not forgotten . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the cause of the crisis is the first that he said in his introduc@@ tory course : the ab@@ str@@ action of a Russian victory in the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the end of the year , it was w@@ ut@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; Putin , Russia , Russia , Russia , Iran , Russia , Pakistan , Russia , Pakistan , Russia , Ukraine , Russia , Pakistan , Russia , Ukraine , Russia &quot;
&quot; however , it was even greater , since there was no greater interest , since there was not a true friend . &quot;
the V@@ et@@ smoke will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; at the same time , the state @-@ controlled media have an intense , un@@ restricted attack on An@@ kara . &quot;
&quot; once again , it seemed to be the door for everything . &quot;
&quot; in the serious accus@@ ations , the accus@@ ations were controlled by his own family from the illegal oil trade in the fields of Syri@@ ans , which have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he made this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message that it was time to look after the front . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting will only be able to hear from the President of the President &apos;s Republic , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a type of victory .
&quot; for An@@ kara , the benefits of a weapon is clear on the hand . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , all friends that he can get down after the last month with a failed state . &quot;
repeated points on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are economic structure .
&quot; Russian sanctions have arrived in Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights , each year usually several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number is almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel expenses and charter companies will be able to be added if the flights will be added to your flights . &quot;
you are currently on a delayed arrival in the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the State was imported and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural production will be imported . &quot;
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes are long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; in the West , An@@ kara on the west side , as it is the reaction to the power of power , as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the continuing Gro@@ unds on the sn@@ ail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ us is to pull out of the cool mood and the relationship of Turkey to reduce the west . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Russian state , the Russian state won in An@@ kara with safety a bonus that he called the State support for the chosen state organic . &quot;
&quot; that is for Moscow . this is a self @-@ explan@@ atory , which has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this romantic palace at the sea , Russia and Turkey , one , as there is one analysis of a analysis , &quot; Alliance of external influences , &quot; Alliance of external influences , &quot; &quot; Alliance of external influences , &quot; &quot; says the West . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are two differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow is to be able to support the role of peace , but where Russia and Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours , both President at the press conference was said that they would not have gone once again . &quot;
the President of Turkey is committed to the question of their differences in Putin while Putin decided to achieve this .
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus that can be found where a common denom@@ inations can be found .
&quot; but after months after months of hos@@ tility - and in view of the Pot@@ ato as for a perfect Dis@@ aster , as the NATO &apos;s member Turkey won the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et , it is certainly better that the two state &apos;s two state is at least again with each other . &quot;

&quot; I say that we don &apos;t have a global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different , and our employees will work together with the customers . &quot;
&quot; R@@ BS has already told that it will not lead to the Six Nations Convention , and that it will increase the landmark of different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because we concentrate on the interior ( we have asked us to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there were three years ago , when we were told that we would have a great Bank , and these brands were killed . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can help these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

&quot; why we do Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . &quot;
&quot; this is what I found myself among the women &apos;s Olympics , and that is more than one reason . &quot;
&quot; first of all , I have ever seen since 1984 at any summer Olympic Games , and the US were never seen . &quot;
&quot; and second : this team has three towers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who was inspired for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Madison Ko@@ be , the Cath@@ kin , is all proud . &quot;
this team reflects the US against the USA .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sports art .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ stones were a A@@ fro @-@ American audience . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
that shows the strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad in and America . &quot;
&quot; now it was the world in the situation , witness of the incredible performance of the three @-@ world champion@@ ships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they still expected , but no great G@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American theatre , which was won by an individual event for women &apos;s gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won in Silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport@@ art , but as you are not from the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie killed all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; , &quot; because the next four races in the team will have four races in the team . moreover , this last year &apos;s last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a train@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ is@@ is a more expensive sport , and in the first line of private classes that will keep up for the training - , registration , travel and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their families ) . &quot;
the majority of these foods are in close proximity to the business that can support the business .
&quot; in this way , you will receive your own training and that is responsible for the families of a most expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both their athletes of athletes , since they started with the Tur@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; we have to make the congreg@@ ations of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . &quot;
I have founded my turn@@ al Foundation of 20 years .
&quot; at my events we have free and affordable tur@@ bo , in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ics ) , and national and international winner . &quot;
&quot; in September , we are expanding our home town ( my home town ) expands to offer the youth high quality Tur@@ ns which offer the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification of the spirit . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
&quot; it &apos;s the inspiration of this team , the thousands young girls will bring them to the Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in the Sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is a so exciting time .
&quot; thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic Games , and thank you so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

&quot; instead of only about the products we wanted to speak in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intestinal health and how it works with the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide more information on an interesting way and way . &quot;
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !

&quot; most of the most travellers who are in the country , Usedom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not the property , must not be able to choose the country . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and on the end of the voices are only wrong . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last resort of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has not yet seen any election of the people over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , when one can say that at all , just started . &quot;
&quot; and it also goes to be something : Prime Erwin Sell@@ ering , An@@ chor of a SPD / EU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;

&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to discuss the assass@@ ination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people have to pay many people in the high refugee camps around the safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that people want to be deep@@ ened to people who are not interested in election times , even in election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the arrival in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the contamination is large .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Union and SPD leaders are increasingly becoming increasingly becoming increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; in the past days we went , between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no need to take a closer look at the event of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which is one of the most important political ideas , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ality also claim a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition and a separation of the double citiz@@ enship . &quot;

&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; , Volkswagen is the possibility that customers can lead to a half year after the conversion around with a engine , and this can lead to the new software that has nothing to do . &quot;

French court accepted by Abr@@ ams of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in the real estate of refugees . &quot;
&quot; during the trial of this week , the authorities moved to Cal@@ ais that the state should have to sell the state within the camp , from cigar@@ ettes to energy , sell or tea for 50 cent ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be lower , because they would be a parallel economy , which would be no taxes , and the risk of fire and san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups distributed over the judgment with that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals that would be offered by the state and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants are often used to offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there is no legal basis for the transfer of people , that the 72 provis@@ ional shops , however , that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the judges Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the food shops , caf@@ és and restaurants have a much larger role to live as just people who live in extremely pre@@ aching conditions . &quot;

Helen G@@ lover and He@@ ather St@@ anning through battle with the cancer of the train@@ ers for rowing

&quot; from the first road to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that found in history , Helen G@@ lover and He@@ ather St@@ anning has an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ aci@@ o da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was one of the first Olympic Games in the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely necessary , all of their hard use , which is also exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; what we see , two famous athletes that reflects on the surface with the elegance of sw@@ elling , which does not reflect the type of the tri@@ p@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; after every gold , a bat@@ ail@@ lon an Bat@@ ail@@ lon to rep@@ utable Hel@@ ab , who was the difference between 30 months not knowing whether he was diagnos@@ ed when he was diagnos@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he said . &quot;
&quot; I had wa@@ ited bladder , the oper@@ able , and it did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , he is everywhere . &quot;
it would be a rather important situation .
it changed a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnos@@ ed in December 2013 .
&quot; however , the trio was lucky that he could start at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , so that the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if such circumstances is the correct term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back to me again . &quot;
it was a incen@@ tive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would have enough . &quot;
so it starts .
the rowing machine is already a challenge but it makes it too much larger .
&quot; in the in@@ mid@@ ability of the Sieg@@ es , their first thoughts on Williams , who had brought something more than else to speak , and that he was to process his own . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which as Haupt@@ mann in Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan was , &quot; I was a emotional w@@ reck . this is perhaps something very , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter how much me this means , how much I am and Helen and also Robin . &quot;
there were three beautiful years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would like no one , so a massive thank you for him . he is the best trainer of the world . &quot;
I would have no better person for train@@ ers or better train@@ ers .
Helena G@@ lover and He@@ ather St@@ anning has been lost in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , than the teams made from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and G@@ lover too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very much in the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; lead in process , lead in process . &quot;
it is really important to be able to use it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make it out .
&quot; we wanted to achieve today , we wanted to achieve a good result , we wanted to get a good result , and to win the race , what we do . &quot;
the couple will take place for a year before it will make decisions about its future .

&quot; the United States of Central Command changes the information to show an optimum picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria , as it was the actual situation of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Germany , reported to the Islamic State in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot;

the guide errors in the Cent@@ com line up to the top of the organization .
&quot; the ten @-@ year report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces . &quot;
&quot; although there is no direct notes to change that the government is to change the reports , it shows how analysts will be exposed to the pressure of their pre@@ judi@@ ces , a optimized image of the threat of the Islam@@ ist state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 , many central points of press releases , statements , statements and statements before the Congress corresponds to the issue . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com An@@ arch@@ ger is known that a military retreat Mos@@ sul@@ s already started in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islam@@ ist state . &quot;

&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the mid @-@ year 2015 , the heads of Central Command asked the reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; in other words , the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans had played the Task Force in life , after them has been played together with the Man@@ ip@@ ulation of reports to the Islam@@ ists state . &quot;
&quot; in the Thursday , the report will be presented yet by detailed insights into the investigations . &quot;
&quot; in addition there are further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports by the General Assembly of the Minister of Defence Ministry . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the news service agreement on Thursday their own insights , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com has provided an extended process for creating measures to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security forces , in the representative of Adam B. ship , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. ship , &quot; delay the publication of rep@@ ay@@ ment reports , &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality of analysts and &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. ship and the Dem@@ ok@@ ers gave no notes on a detail of the family house at the Cent@@ com Anal@@ ysts , to have found a particular political opinion . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; where always you &apos;re too late , it &apos;s the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; in Rio de Janeiro , the events in Rio de Janeiro feel well @-@ resistant and un@@ inten@@ sely to the competition between competition and alle@@ vi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is , when the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself is a fire@@ storm , which will protect the light from the rock to the Tri@@ ath@@ y to the Tri@@ ath@@ y . &quot;
&quot; you can read the TV , a newspaper or at the conversation of your neighb@@ ors in the Wart@@ es@@ hop , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ver@@ y or the battle between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had to hear C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are a log in Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; in the first time , Do@@ ol@@ ey , the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with Gr@@ üb@@ bers , who would have to be sent to the Prime Time , which has been created by sponsors and well@@ being @-@ TV advertising , if he would like to come to the Prime Time . &quot;

&quot; we will always have the chest , and let it be long . &quot;
&quot; but if I would like modest arguments for my specific Lieb@@ ling , then let me know the attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ comes already has been a Olympic event in Sydney as it was in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so that many that I did not know that there was a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be the regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
&quot; although the US athletes sent to the competition , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ese and until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians have to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the can@@ ada to share the women .
Dong Bell and Ro@@ ots Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada to defend this year their gold medal from London .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ars has a certain outdoor char@@ ms , partially because it sounds perfect for a c@@ low@@ ns@@ schule as for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I have to admit that I have no expert , but only a er@@ d@@ row@@ ed enthusiasm . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , hum@@ or@@ ist potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ unci@@ ation - but also the Gra@@ z@@ ie of the Turn@@ ens and dive , which combines two sports , which is essentially improved . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which is so much more like &quot; jumping board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , nearly up to 30 foot in the air and must have a number of other movements ( turning , h@@ ash and sal@@ tos ) before they come on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they will be submitted by official Olympi@@ ad to the execution , difficulty level and time &quot; flight time . &quot;
&quot; two years ago , athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will be in Rio on each other . &quot;
the most common V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to go down to gold , faster , after top and down , sometimes until the goal , sometimes , and back , after top and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only the finish line or the output wall , but in the television and also another key target : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to dis@@ solve it , even fan@@ tasi@@ es , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to stir in order to stir . &quot;
but it is also what I can look at this games as something else .
this offers the tramp@@ oline a At@@ emp@@ ause .
the V@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ism is above .
a pre @-@ movement is not the target .
&quot; after that , he or she pr@@ all@@ t , as an A@@ stron@@ aut , goes back to top , then back to top . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the practical , elegant appearance of time and heavy force . &quot;

there are numerous complaints that everything from soil use up to the cold handle in relation to power of reg@@ imes .
&quot; according to a vast majority , the ruling party and its allies to the last head of the opposition and control over 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time the tension along the border along the border with the border , a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ ling , controversial line called on the June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; as a result , as the Oro@@ mo @-@ war front or the National Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which could have more or less be@@ aded , the tur@@ bul@@ enzen have become more or less be@@ forehand . &quot;
&quot; for several factors , why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ed after years ago the surface is now explo@@ ded under the surface . &quot;

&quot; ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Hebrew , logical ) &quot;
&quot; the second factor is that it is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethylene in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
&quot; the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ i@@ ens in Christian high countries , in the Politics and Economy , while they live the Oro@@ mos of which many Muslims are living and in flat land@@ lords . &quot;
but also the changes are straight .

&quot; a lot of Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos , the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tiger , the approximately 6 percent of the population and the military , in the trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel@@ lion , was up to his death at a non @-@ published disease in 2012 17 years . &quot;
&quot; he became a tac@@ tical gen@@ ie , a man who could think of the corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special needs to use opponent to edit opponents . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing at this fundamental point , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 1 ( Western Europe ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 2 ( Central Europe )
&quot; other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the tiger the Northern region of North @-@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ ens , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South . &quot;

&quot; in 2005 , the last time that Ethiopia had been arrested in 2005 , after thousands of the elections were prot@@ ested by the government , according to the data of analysis , by the government &apos;s government and then stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ cia , many prot@@ otypes were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
ISO @-@ 8859 @-@ 1 ( Western Europe ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 2 ( Central Europe )
&quot; however , this does not affect the Inten@@ si@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government . &quot;
and she takes a dangerous ethical form .
&quot; last month of the prot@@ otypes in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ ical town , from Tiger ray guided shops and the house of the tiger is becoming increasingly common in the social media . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the protests against the US and other Western European citizens were created in a different position . &quot;
&quot; the American Government use Ethiopia as base for d@@ ron@@ age trips over the United States , even if they have been concluded that they closed this basis . &quot;
&quot; during the West , the democracy wants to support democracy , he wants to breaks his role in one of the same region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ walk . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump explains him to be founded in the &quot; &quot; sar@@ cas@@ u@@ alties &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump said on Friday the last meeting , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , new questions are to communicate with communication skills of the presidential candidate , whether it is clear and understand@@ able to communicate with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings forth his compas@@ sion , to take him during an event phase in protection , in order to explain the true position , which he did not have . &quot;
&quot; after he made the attack on a election on Wednesday , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the statement of the Thursday and took place in interviews that he was really not intended to examine the president and Mrs. Clinton would have been created . &quot;
&quot; but in a early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply s@@ ark@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , unlike the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews said , he says the an@@ archy of all seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ box Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump help to destroy him , he wanted to destroy him that Mr. Obama had to destroy him , he wanted nothing of it . &quot;

Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought him to his defense .
&quot; in the end of July he had strong criticism , as he said , the Rus@@ sen should come to Mrs. Clin@@ tons , but he said later , I think the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump the language limits to the politics and then need back to ru@@ bb@@ ish .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test such messages from his fans as they arrive , and then make sure . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which is the language of both candidates . &quot;
I think it is necessary enough to keep his statements so that they can be interpreted in different ways .

&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , a guided tour of the North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ head @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally speaking , for his prov@@ ok@@ ers did not have to be able to understand his critics or to understand his statements or humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthened in the focus of its presi@@ dency in the last months of its presi@@ dency , Mr. Tr@@ unk Scher@@ ze his loy@@ al compas@@ sion into the un@@ comfortable situation in the un@@ comfortable situation . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ endy &apos;s most important Für@@ sten@@ cies , gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in an CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I think what he says , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he said to the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ento statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton was founded in the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Obama is an almost un@@ well known , small organization , he called the back@@ yard , completely wrong , and therefore it happened , because he went out from the Iraq . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , most of the Ma@@ instream @-@ Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in the South Clinton as an external Minister , it were allowed to bring the situation in the Middle East in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the elect@@ oral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump is his attacks on the media . &quot;
&quot; he raised the &quot; poor , j@@ uly &quot; TV experts who try to understand him , and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , some of the Dem@@ ok@@ rates mo@@ urn about Mr. Tr@@ ace debt as only a further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the President of the Office . &quot;

the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is also a great success .

&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ er to understand why the stars are in the star wars , as well as in the context of the plan@@ etary bodies . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we learn from the application of our results with other pages , more about the relationship between the mass of a s@@ ect , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a research leader at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;@@ s Electricity Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the Star of Ple@@ y@@ aden is situated in the light of the earth from the earth .
&quot; at the same time , many stars in this star that were built around 125 million years ago . &quot;
they turn now on the fastest .
&quot; at top of the top of the top , this classic @-@ star star is a large quantities of star . &quot;
&quot; this wind through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a unique effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star , begins to slow down its red @-@ rate . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler accepts the Rot@@ ating rate of every man , by making the time between the creation of a dynamic range -- such as sun@@ spots -- . &quot;
the newest catalogue of Rot@@ ating rates are turning to the massive star slower than less massive star .
&quot; the stars are the stars with dancers , with larger stars as smaller than smaller than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow speed is to be slow down to the faster rot@@ ors , very bright star to be very bright star . &quot;
&quot; since the Star of Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities such as Rot@@ ating rates . &quot;
&quot; the Zodiac of Ple@@ y@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot;
&quot; it is still much about us to learn more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why star their red @-@ rates , slow and to speak their &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; live and their colleagues have read more about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ aden reports , which will soon appear at the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; at the same time , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines . &quot;
not rare is the sleeping expression of any other illness .
&quot; very early recording , particularly with a depression , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .

&quot; this leads to the voltage , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
what should you do with sleep disorders ?
&quot; who has a period of a month in at least three nights in at least three nights in at least three nights in at least three nights in at least three nights , the doctor should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment can look at different : you is ab@@ sent , tired , un@@ touched , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily accessible , voice or physical symptoms such as mag@@ nit@@ ude or head@@ aches . &quot;
it is important to talk about the sleep . it is important to find their causes .
&quot; as a treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al behaviour , a cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or medicines - classical sleeping bag only in exceptional cases and a maximum of two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is no doubt that Prof. Ingo Fi@@ edler , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it should be seen at sleep problems with sleep problems . &quot;
&quot; this can be done with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
who should be in the sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for the investigation in the bedroom laboratory , medical treatments for example in sn@@ ail with respir@@ atory diseases , even if one can &apos;t find the cause of a ste@@ al interference , with sleep disorders , or if one can &apos;t find the cause of a ste@@ al interference . &quot;
&quot; for the investigation , you must not be able to do so . &quot;
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ è . &quot;
after listening to the normal time you get to the normal time into bed .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des of the body , one can make a single chest strap , a chest strap and a hairdryer at the fingers . &quot;
there is also a camera at the ceiling in the ceiling .
do you want to report this message ?
there are quite lots of the screws that can set up for a better sleep .
&quot; at the same time , it was not to sleep in the bed , not to sleep in bed , not to sleep in bed , alcohol and night not at the clock . &quot;

&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , zi@@ v@@ ile officials were known in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a Ban@@ de , which was known to the police from previous theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had been born in the middle of July this year , several delic@@ acies and were very professional . &quot;

&quot; on the 13th of July , a Berliner administration of the Court that had been refused , and a day later , police and construction workers under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ etic , and lived among the Ju@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; at this summer morning , the street will go peaceful with children with children , people sitting on the houses of the houses in the sun , others are pre@@ m late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the building projects , there are a basic school and children &apos;s gardens . &quot;
&quot; in 1999 , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who was born in 1999 in the Kie@@ z , and Jana * , which has three children great , especially from the police . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the home projects , they share the concern for the need of machinery and gases . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it does not mean that the majority of the police forces . &quot;
&quot; the Gr@@ aben , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police between home and their neighb@@ ors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin , a traditional workers in the east of Berlin , which has been a very low average and high ar@@ thri@@ tis risk . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , there were numerous houses in the former G@@ DR . in 1990 , numerous houses have been engaged in the former G@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; during the Mother@@ land , many of the projects were killed in a regular street , many of the projects were inhab@@ ited by the people in Riga , which had been occupied before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in the last few years have become increasingly important for tourists and election ants from all over the world : &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ s are being attacked as symbols for these development : they were det@@ ained on the designed slices , or fresh @-@ prepared faç@@ ade , which were formed with colour@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; there is no other street , this year so often together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ous violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all the neighb@@ ors who do not imp@@ ly the problem , that they are not necessarily affected by the crime . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the crimes of the crimes of the Court of the Court of Justice , the re@@ mn@@ ant of the new buildings and fresh@@ ly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been for 17 years in a rental apartment next to the controversial 94 lives , can be no speech . &quot;
&quot; in the 94 , their neighb@@ ors , the people in the 94 are their neighb@@ ors , which are not been determined . &quot;
even the famous fire@@ man cars will not be able to see more in the R@@ īga .
&quot; on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here is no criminal focal point , in the contrary : &quot; &quot; here is one of one another , lives together on the road and gets more each other than else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously aware of the R@@ īga street and stayed in the R@@ īga street .
&quot; as a result , it was also important that the victims of the police said : from the police , the politics and the media , which was in July all the interpretation of the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants , like Neu@@ geb@@ auer will continue to continue the road to them . &quot;
&quot; they are at the same time , they are not interesting - here , people who are not interesting - here are more people who are not so good . &quot;
violence and destruction shall I do not .
&quot; but what shall you do , if a never before someone ? &quot;
&quot; on all sides , there is fru@@ stration , even in the police and the people . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer had a little understanding : the door projects and the left scene were invited to the Princess . &quot;
