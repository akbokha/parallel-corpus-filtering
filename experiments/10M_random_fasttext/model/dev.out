about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .

&quot; since the Vice @-@ President a potential for the presi@@ dency of the city , would like to see 57 percent of the democratic defic@@ its in the race - although a third believes that he should do not . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the European Parliament will be asked for the party of its second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top of the top . &quot;

&quot; Bi@@ den is with distance a second at this measurement , but the percentage of the percentage of it is the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the question of what is more important in the question of an candidates , the democr@@ acies of the vot@@ ers do questions about the vot@@ ers . &quot;

&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail provides no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion of their own opinion . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly national parks , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are become bad . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton from the vot@@ ers of their party , this continue to see a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers , eight percent less than in last month , and 15 points less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;

&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss took his attitude , even if he had not so good services , and that does not know me ; he is primarily a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test rig will be difficult to set his characters is difficult .
Ly@@ th was seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton was the chance to win the chance to play .
&quot; the only work that you can rise , that England first Jonathan is in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a sh@@ epherd . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor @-@ cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he had been in a Tr@@ ent Bridge , what we were very pleased . &quot;
&quot; he must be at least the same opportunities as the same opportunities as before him , but this depends of the teams in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to make mo@@ een beside me , what a Extra win Bow@@ ler and four people would get there , and I have nothing to do it , and I have nothing to do it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a percussion there is not afraid , and this link has been shown that he has already been shown that he has already been shown that he has a dev@@ ils of Cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een has maybe his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no great difference . &quot;
&quot; my first 38 tests at the first 38 tests at the first drop , before he started 2001 . &quot;
he has three hundred R@@ us immediately and do not back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the K@@ ader as Back @-@ up @-@ shaft , and in my limited handling with him , he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; but there is no large number of backup and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup and the trainer have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot of learning .
&quot; apart from the team , England is a couple of clever work at the train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the birth of Mah@@ ela Sal@@ omon , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master degree . &quot;
he is one of the most beautiful Ker@@ le of the game that has been played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application in the setup .
&quot; I hope that he has been created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as players or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela , he has changed views from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can benefit from which we can

&quot; the asser@@ tion of a state @-@ related agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was made from a meeting of 12 persons , partially covered with connections to tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; experts who are interested in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , created by the Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E , the &quot; fundamental report &quot; in recent month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have the power handling of data in data and provided to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a guide in medical specialist magazine &quot; &quot; last month handle the &quot; &quot; exceptional basis &quot; , &quot; based on PH@@ E its most important conclusions . &quot;
two other researchers write to BM@@ J and have been asked whether the asser@@ tion is on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at London School of hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ers , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on the effectiveness of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that the role of PH@@ E that &quot; &quot; the present best practice is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement made out of a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ conference programme ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to develop their opinions on the damage of different Nik@@ ot@@ in @-@ hal@@ ted products . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ turing said that a sponsor of a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health was established by the British American Airlines ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he wrote the references from BA@@ T to the public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants came to the meeting , the means of a E @-@ cigarette producers , but not the financing that he will get to reports from the tobacco company Philip V International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ enland will not be delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarette lighter than which are also available in the paper . &quot;

&quot; however , there will be no this connection or limitations in the PH@@ E Report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ turing said that the asser@@ tion of PH@@ E that there is no evidence that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes than a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking .

every second life long smo@@ kers dies on his Su@@ cht .

PH@@ E has the right duty to information about the public and what does not have any public confusion about the rel@@ ational dangers in comparison to tobacco .
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people die annually in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking is the national health system of two billion £ per year . &quot;
&quot; this means that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a part of the damage that is caused by the smoking causes , we fulfill our national authorities . &quot;
BBC One Day To The En@@ ders Of The World
&quot; the former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said to send the BBC should stop , programs like the En@@ ders and The Voice . &quot; &quot; he said that commercial &quot; &quot; their right arm would be &quot; &quot; for hit shows how the Albert Square dim@@ ples . &quot;
Johnson said that the round trip will only be used to make the type of programs that will not be sent by other UK @-@ transmitter .
&quot; however , the BBC has been seen that they are open @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time to the most popular shows of their acts as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson , that he was six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are shown in order or sends them not to sub@@ mitting &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication committee in the framework of its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the round trip , what I know @-@ or @-@ long @-@ term is not for a good idea , one should do his production at least to programs that don &apos;t make it or in order . &quot;
&quot; you will send The Voice in a first time window , because they want to reach a wide variety of support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one can show it is a joke , it is difficult , it is of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I see not , why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs , which could be examined without substr@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the voice is one of the program , fasc@@ ism is one another , in fact , both self @-@ production . &quot;
there are other channels of their right arm for the right arm .
I am sure to see how this is a public TV .
I don &apos;t think that this is the BBC &apos;s BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the BBC 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s BBC will be able to ensure that the best way is to secure the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the BBC shows that the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public health programs are not subject to BB@@ C4 , but they meet their tasks , and they can improve their tasks , and they can improve their tasks , and they can create all these ob@@ sc@@ oring programs , which no one has seen . &quot;
they place them in a period of time in which they ever wanted to see .
&quot; the Committee said Johnson to the Committee : &quot; &quot; I meet you , a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can find the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all that you think for 150 £ per year here a great value , but for people who do not have a lot of money if it is not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , which was published before the Committee on Tuesday , that the BBC will check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to inform you . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC production would now officially recognised as a education - he said that there is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio , and they should change this change in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of the partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ fully in television , and with the commercial must@@ ard to make everything online . &quot;

further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said to activate the power of a new project , Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , with the ultr@@ as@@ ound , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day the bass process could replace the electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of the symptoms of the Park@@ inson disease . &quot;
&quot; they can &apos;t react to ultr@@ as@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that they did it , when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bladder . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , the ultr@@ as@@ ound and the ultr@@ as@@ ound . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ as@@ ound systems are used on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ or channels are found in the membrane of some of the dice cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound process the opening of these I@@ on@@ ization channels and activate the cells that they are assigned , so a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound las@@ ers , the Chal@@ as@@ ani genetic table is that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ ization channels . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the changes to the changes , the sound system is strengthened through the micro@@ bl@@ ers and the dice where they can turn the co@@ on@@ eur@@ ization of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similar features with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a revolutionary tool , the scientists allows the neur@@ ons with an impulse of light , and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics are some advantages on this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent to a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , you can pass the frequency ultr@@ as@@ ound and can be taken into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with Gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make it possible for the ultr@@ as@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and vitamins in producing cells , added to other applications . &quot;

which solution offer you ?
Markus Gil@@ ead : the mass@@ acre accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ all has no sustainability .
for the people stay in a large part here .
&quot; in the following decades , we need to have sufficient living space in the next decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ bert : a small house needs to be the last space .
it facilitates the integration of integration .
this is different if you are able to see people in the living blocks .
&quot; each of six houses that are built in the pilot project , consists of three living units for four children . &quot;
&quot; every living unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say , it is back to peace , I go back . &quot;
the houses are easy to be built according to the respective needs .
what are the cost ?
Gil@@ ead : the price for 160 square meters per house is located on 184 000 Euro without property .
this is over@@ able .

&quot; but since the great rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed leader have recognized that there is a complete third mand@@ ate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mand@@ ate could be seen in a decision to find it . it will be well known that the US economy is ready to be asked if the US economy is ready to be seen by the near to zero on zero cost of interest in the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of economy show that it grows solid grows , could lead the latest tur@@ bul@@ enzen to the global financial markets , and it is also just around a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the IAB is conducting an Online Survey of its German@@ - and English @-@ language web presence . &quot;

&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed the phrases to this time , he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , it would be very far to see the financial crisis , so that they are not in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts showed that a cement of the financial markets , because they would like to act the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed does not change . &quot;

&quot; in spring and early summer , they said that they are necessary in this year despite the complaints of Liber@@ al , that more economic progress would be necessary to increase an increase of the Stat@@ ute . &quot;

&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world is one of the main part of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be liable for its decision . &quot;
but in the En@@ de@@ ff@@ ling the F@@ ed Currency Authority in the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; in 2013 , the F@@ ed its mon@@ archy expansion &quot; ver@@ tically &quot; in 2013 , the F@@ ed its mon@@ archy expansion &quot; ver@@ tically &quot; in the globe around the globe . &quot;

&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives of these pump@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should be the aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis , in 2008 at the first place , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee of the Bank of England . &quot;
the latest tur@@ bul@@ enzen are not close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; they will certainly not be seen in the situation , in which they fear in fear , because the markets become exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the par@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;

&quot; for easy over@@ time , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy over@@ ly people with type 2 diabetes can take place after a new study at least five years .
&quot; it &apos;s still too early to say , whether slightly over@@ ly people with diabetes after the weight loss of surgery , longer live as those who do not @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; a long time to show something to show something , &quot; Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ ama . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or Adi@@ li@@ as surgery , use different methods to use the size of the Mag@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; they reduce hunger and stimul@@ ate the body &apos;s own ability , food . &quot;
&quot; over the years the Adi@@ li@@ as operations at the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes than efficient , but most studies were carried out with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in relation to size , is considered as normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is important , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are the fat burning . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General hospital information that have been collected in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ li@@ as @-@ surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ahnen and Mag@@ en@@ closures - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in humans , which are easily accessible to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I under which the operation of this surgery took up from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; however , the BM@@ I was in those who are non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments about 29 . &quot;
&quot; under those who under@@ went up a surgical procedure , in 36 % the diabetes disease can be completely and at 28 % in 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medical treatment Group , compared to the diabetes , only two per cent compared with only two per cent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol to &quot; in general is better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group . &quot;
&quot; the researchers found the patients with patients with hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , the blood sugar values compared to the time . &quot;
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c will be held at the best under 7 % .
&quot; after surgery , the average Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;

&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; Gl@@ enn control &quot; &quot; - how you feel in the improved Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level . &quot;
the research focuses on average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass @-@ surgery group was lost in comparison to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ om@@ ie Group more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , reached bigger back outputs in the BM@@ I ( 3,@@ 4 % of 2.1 % ) and was a complete over@@ flow of diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % of 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; during the new study , the surgery on five years , there is a study of a study of surgery in Sweden , that surgery on a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , there was a lot of people who tried to die with a Adi@@ li@@ as surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival for survival at the surgery patients , the Black@@ stone , the Black@@ stone , it is cal@@ f for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 , which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because they says that these surgery in this lower BM@@ I Group is lower , without further risk of death or kidney disease , they said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start , weight seriously , once the patient with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we have to wait to wait until we will bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
I think that once they have developed these genetic modifications to have their body with fat burning and diabetes .

here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani thought course as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory at Mal@@ m@@ ö on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria had less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French master on the way , but after they finally found a number of opportunities , before they finally ended her face as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ eigh@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needed Paris , a strong start against the Swedish master , since they not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but a improvement on the road to the quarter of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they were the points , it was no classic game from Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or off in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win , but even if there are certain things that we have to make certain things that we have to do at the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
this is a good name .
&quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I regre@@ t it that we did not have a or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his application in one of three changes in the Paris team , that was on the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on its own place in the First World War , but he was born in the fourth minute by Di Mary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the PS@@ G on the next stage , the PS@@ G on the next stage in Europe can take place when he began in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ m@@ ö @-@ defense , before he went into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G has a great victory , who was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to achieve this stage , at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national play@@ ers on the field and was with a five @-@ husband @-@ defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but except one of the Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ idi@@ ic , the far more of Jonathan Tr@@ on P@@ fo@@ sters in the 34@@ th minute , it was little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes on , with some lack of arguments , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which was not less than five days in the first half of half , and then given after Cav@@ ani came to the new start . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria in a turning point , which was created by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2 minute on the P@@ fo@@ sters ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally finally after the hours of the Cav@@ ani brand , thanks to Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; in the end , all thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö will come back to the game , and only an excellent ornam@@ entation of Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could not stop the end result in order to stop the En@@ der@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G has played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December in the last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have played only in the Swedish player , which has not played the same level . &quot;
the qualification is not made from .
