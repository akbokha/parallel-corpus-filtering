main subject : k@@ c@@ aries and infections of the denti@@ stry con@@ fron@@ ts the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is a risk factor that the authors are acc@@ ustom@@ ed to the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore more frequent to frequent g@@ um infections in smo@@ kers .
&quot; therefore , the risk for c@@ aries increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; people who listened to smoking , could you reduce their risk within short time , to write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it may last for ten years , until the end@@ anger@@ ing return to the level of non @-@ smoking , declared the first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;

we know .
what we do not know how long life will take everything and how long it will be .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
a rec@@ ession was found within only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siv@@ ity of the Federal Reserve at the rates of interest rates are often , if not always , a factor that will react to the economy and financial investments . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the US @-@ Central Bank is so severe that investors should not focus on interest when they begins to increase the interest rates but rather than the period that is needed for the norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables can play a role . &quot;

&quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously opposed to some than a signal for the end of the trial period , &quot; said Julian Jay@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; unlike in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal heights , but still on a lower level to be found on the sei@@ ze shock that seem to be afraid . &quot;
this does not mean that there is no effects .
here is a historic trends based on historic trends how some areas of economy could respond to :
&quot; as the market in last month , the funding measure may take advantage of interest income , for a while driving . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase , the influence is not dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that investments in 12 to 24 months after the first increase , what perhaps the del@@ ays in monetary policy was reflected in a new study which happened after the rate of interest in F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is now published in the previous 35 years ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days . &quot;

rec@@ es@@ sions are a fact of economic life but interest income is often carried out .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed with a number of conditions are faced with some conditions that could not use the Rec@@ ession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to the lowest point in the lowest point during an income ratio of F@@ ed . &quot;
the interest rate of the income rose to EUR 75 per cent compared with the result of the total income of the GDP per cent by 4.5 % .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates , interest rates , income and interest rates are risk of interest rates . &quot;
market participants have made all the year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed ; and all eyes were prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ended on Thursday .
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists think that the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading just could only be a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the rising cycles of 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increasing moment@@ um at the B@@ IP , and Before a rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ist was placed very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , so the report . &quot;
&quot; unlike in contrast , this is the clear slow recovery from which the worst rec@@ ession in the observed phase was observed . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is far from far the longest , the F@@ ed since the end of the last rec@@ ession ; the record was 35 months , and this is so far ( 74 months ) . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the middle of the capital , as the capital of the North Sea , the capital of the North Sea , the capital of the North Sea , the capital of the North Sea , and the capital of the capital . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in case of bonds , the ren@@ ders appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering of the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the anchor was immediately the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Strat@@ osphere of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will lead to increase between longer and shorter bond issues , and lead to a distance of curve . &quot;
&quot; high antioxid@@ ants compl@@ ains often in such a climate better income , although &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t careful to expect higher income , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fixed Income Analy@@ zers at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
it is interesting to say that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy &apos;s markets .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the Dollars and the decline of inflation , there are some indication that the market has adapted to the prospect of strict monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; interests are compl@@ emented by the tragic , credit cards and the Vol@@ ati@@ l@@ eness is risen by the market - all the features of the market , if the F@@ ed their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and more , companies that benefit from the larger part of their business activity in the US . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts are bad , because there are increasing share their products on the global market and in the financing of their deb@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares were to react to three months after an initial rate of interest , and said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , companies with low stock market balance after each of the income accounts in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average around 5 percentage points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital expansion , as well as low productivity by their shares , their Pend@@ ants were met with low quality around the average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) . &quot;

&quot; it is one thing to learn about all parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know almost anywhere . &quot;
&quot; perhaps , they are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; as he asked , Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 role of environmental influences from Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice to do Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to give my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the following paragraph shows that the issue of the book describes the action of the book , instead an analysis of the film version of 2012 , the new characters and details added to extend the rather short list text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the city of Th@@ inner city , where all nature eman@@ ates is , and even the air is a commodity , the boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by giving their desire to see a genuine name , Dr. Se@@ uss , whose rich@@ ly name Theodor Se@@ uss has died , and the 1991 was not unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that does not want to suspect enough : the summary of the Lor@@ ax @-@ movie , on the web site of the Lor@@ ax @-@ movie , where everything is artificial , and even the air has a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; once again , once again , a prag@@ matic person seems to be quite familiar with the fact that Cameron will not trust the action of the book . &quot;
&quot; most probably , such a relatively low PR task to a hel@@ ix , The Lor@@ ax is not read 20 times a child . &quot;
&quot; Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ man said that this text probably is probably one of the Camer@@ ata &apos;s circular letter . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text from the Cameron &apos;s text has been delivered , but no more immediate shipping comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clear from the official US &apos;s official team , but it &apos;s still difficult to see . &quot;
&quot; by using Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but if you selected the k@@ ader , the England for the tour is not found on my card , is not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclu@@ de an extension of victory . I would not exclu@@ de an extension of victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks are probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ lec@@ raft model , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will be no less sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive setting . &quot;
&quot; the ball is developed by the Ball , Ali as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; in this message , Adam Ly@@ th was replaced by the England test k@@ ader , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision , Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is of course for me as his principal coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , too . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ player is committed to results . &quot;
&quot; no thread marks in Joe Root , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I &apos;ve said this to the nom@@ ination - players do their own not@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after a long time , one had been extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of the Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be a chance to win the Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss poss@@ essed his attitude , even if he did not have a good performance , and the surprised me not ; he is primarily a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test failed to set up his characters is difficult .
&quot; he got seven chances - like Sam Smith &apos;s son , and Nick Comp@@ ton nine died . &quot;

&quot; the only pre @-@ throw thing you can lift , that England first played Jonathan Tur@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in the highest form , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist , which I had high . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor for Cri@@ cket@@ player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he came back against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was very well known . &quot;
&quot; he must at least the same opportunities as those who received before him , but this depends on the project position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;

&quot; experts , experts in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined by them by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; PH@@ E published the &quot; &quot; fundamental report &quot; &quot; in the past month and describes him as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive verification of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said to send the BBC to stop making programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Aug@@ als &quot; was their right arm &quot; for hit shows , like Albert Square . &quot;
Johnson said that the round service charge would be used to make the kind of programs that will not be sent by other UK @-@ transm@@ issions .
&quot; he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC to ensure that they are publicly funded by a smaller audience , in hard controversial passage against the most popular shows of their rival communities like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , said Johnson to come six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC in contact . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are shown in order , or sending out un@@ subsidi@@ zed &quot; rival &quot; , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication committee in the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; when you want to keep the round @-@ up fee , what I do , or long @-@ term is not necessary for a good idea , one should not make his production at least to programs that do not make or in order . &quot;
&quot; send the voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression of tax is funded that could also be funded without subsidies .
&quot; the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , harmon@@ izing both own production . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would be hon@@ oured to their right arm . &quot;
I am sorry to see how this is publicly a public TV .

&quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC coll@@ ects on the hunt to reviews , because the am@@ bition of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular champ@@ ions of the BBC , which was re @-@ elected by the former Head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart session in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public authorities should not measure up to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue it , when they are not able to create their missions , and they can argue it , and , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ oring programmes , which no one has seen . &quot;
they place them in a time window that no one has ever wanted to see .
&quot; to the round @-@ up fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I highly recommend you to find a more reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions , who can best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all that you think for 150 £ a year here is a great value , but for people who do for the 150 £ a lot of money if it is true , because it is not a lot of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ liner and Channel 5 @-@ chef David El@@ stein , who said before the Committee on Tuesday , said that the BBC expl@@ ored her real@@ ms to check , to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as a formation , he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of the partnerships is El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , from whom he said that only a handful of television showed them , and with the commercial broadcasting corporations to make everything online . &quot;

&quot; the researchers said to activate the power of a new proceedings , Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , with the ultr@@ as@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;

&quot; the procedure has some similar features with op@@ to@@ genetic , an ground@@ breaking tool that enables neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light and off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; however , in contrast to light , that has to be sent to a optical fibers to the desired position in the brain , you can pass a low frequency injection system to the brain , and can be sent into the brain from above to the skull . &quot;

the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order by Congress : Maxim@@ isation of the US @-@ employment and prices are stable here .
&quot; but since the great rec@@ ession , the F@@ ed Guide have recognized that it is an un@@ break@@ able third mand@@ ate yet : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mand@@ ate could be in a decision to be closely linked to it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be acc@@ ustom@@ ed by the unprecedented incen@@ tive at the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of economy show that they could improve solid growth , the latest turbul@@ ences in global financial markets have already intensi@@ fied by the aboli@@ tion of interest for economic bonds , and it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;

&quot; but I think , if they were on the search for a prec@@ au@@ tionary note , the improved uncertainty around the global market is enough to maintain the global market enough to maintain . &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus that the F@@ ed is to do with the financial market for itself .

&quot; for easy over@@ l@@ ative diabe@@ tics , weight loss is helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss times for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes cannot last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ ly most important people with diabetes after the weight loss occurs sooner than those who do not @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; Dr. Robin Kno@@ stone , an expert of weight loss and surgery , who wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ ama . &quot;

&quot; they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to create food . &quot;
&quot; more than that years , Adi@@ posit@@ as interventions have been used for treating type @-@ 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out by people in humans with a body @-@ mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
BM@@ I and a certain level of weight in terms of size is considered as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that one is important , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered a fat burning . &quot;
you can also charge your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Health data that have collected has been collected in a study and compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and stomach cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans , which were slightly over@@ due . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decre@@ ased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the fifth of the fifth year .
&quot; however , the BM@@ I remained in those who were not @-@ surgical diabe@@ tic treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who are subjected to a surgical procedure , the diabetes is completely dis@@ solved and in 28 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were in controlling the blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general in general in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers have also monitored the patients of blood vessels from hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is held at 7 percent , the researchers were held in the field of laboratory . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average of hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels of approximately 9 percent to around 6 % . &quot;
&quot; in medical treatment , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; &quot; bite control &quot; &quot; - how you reflect themselves in the improved ha@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - minim@@ ised not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
there was also average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group was lost in comparison to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ om@@ ie Group more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) in the BM@@ I ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and expressed a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; during the new study , there is no survival benefit of the surgery for five years , there are references from a study of heavy men in Sweden , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no advantage for survival for the surgery with surgery , said Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing for persons with one BM@@ I below 35 which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
this is the critical point of this study because it says that these operation in this lower BM@@ I Group is lower than the risk of death or kidney disease .
Black@@ stone added that people and their physi@@ cians should start to take weight seriously once the patient with its BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we have too long waiting until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
I think the once they have added these genetic changes that have been associated with fat burning and diabetes is a reverse .

&quot; in Europe , not all refugees see all refugees , the Dal@@ ai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;

&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama , the problem of the chronic refugee crisis at the beginning of its ten days , in its speech at the opening of the Dal@@ ai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford . &quot;
&quot; he said that under the given circumstances , interests of the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; it also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries at the refugee rise , but the situation cannot be adequate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dal@@ ai Lama Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in the reinforcement of the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to look for several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and real development , mainly by education that can be created by education , for this Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; finally , we must re@@ think about the killing in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved this problem , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dal@@ ai Lama said the issue of violence , and said George Bush &apos;s action to the terrorist attack on 11 September and was out that the violent reaction of the US would be a chain of un@@ ont@@ ological events . &quot;
&quot; after 11 of September , I have tried my pants in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to the solution of this problem lies in violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he continued violence , and that has had unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dal@@ ai Lama . &quot;

I witness a witness at the Court &apos;s Court in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma .
&quot; anything later today , except in a late conviction , I will watch as a man to death . &quot;
&quot; however , when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is carried out by the Gi@@ ft@@ sy@@ m . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death . &quot;
&quot; the invitation was for the first time in January , about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I fought . &quot;
&quot; as the day closer I began to fear , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I had thought that I thought it would be a good way to tell the entire story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it &apos;s true that journalists can be seen in the US , and there is often more applications than places available to decide who is chosen . &quot;

&quot; he started his game on Saturday evening with our Free Sunday evening and how exciting you play , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George , when a boring team died , and Wayne said that he will take care of a separation . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we can view as exciting , especially its young player with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game that you want to play when you play this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all its kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Franklin , so that they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build strong trust , because they tell them things because they have a bit worried to play with us . &quot;

Maria Gruber - myFanbase
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani &apos;s course , as Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main his Champions League Season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Mal@@ m@@ ö . &quot;
&quot; di Mary , less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G @-@ player who brought the French master on the way , but after that they finally found a number of opportunities before they finally found their way to Cav@@ ani as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1. minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ oc@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as she is not only the qualification for the K.@@ oc@@ .-@@ l@@ aps , but a improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while at the points there was no classic game from Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs out opportunities ahead of the gate . he was later in the game against his home town @-@ team and against the association , with whom he began his career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to gain at home or down@@ hill in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win , but even if there are certain things that we have to make in the course of the season , &quot;
this is a good intention .
&quot; we win , and we won &apos;t win , although I regre@@ t that we did not have one or two further gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to his injury in one of three changes into the Paris Team at the weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place to Bordeaux into the First League but it was held in the fourth minute through Di Maria .
&quot; in the last month of Manchester United States , the PS@@ G won the next stage in Manchester United , and in the last month of Manchester United , and in the last month of Manchester United , and he looked more , why , when he started in Marco Ver@@ ment@@ er Pass , before he started to have a long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; as a result , I believed that PS@@ G appears to achieve a great victory that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ m@@ ö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to achieve this stage , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine voc@@ alist on the field and was composed of a five @-@ husband and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ holm , who goes far to Kevin Tr@@ act in the 34@@ th minute , they used little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , PS@@ G itself was sometimes carried out with some patches and bad connections , but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that had not been given less than five bands alone in the first half of half , after Cav@@ ani had ended up after the new start . &quot;
&quot; still he pointed out much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria in a turning point , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2 minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally going shortly after the hours of Cav@@ ani yesterday , with its sixth Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; all thought that Mal@@ m@@ ö the game is going back to the game , and only an excellent understanding of Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could not stop the end result before the waiting list suddenly appears to at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Mal@@ m@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G had played a class about his team , and he said : &quot; our final Supreme League game was in December during the last year . &quot;
since then we have played only in the Swedish title that is not the same level .
