the inj@@ unc@@ tion solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders when the or@@ ale is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to take the solution to take or the melt @-@ tab@@ let@@ ins are applied to patients who suffer from tablets difficulty . &quot;
&quot; for patients who take advantage of other medicines , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this causes the signal transmission between the brain cells by &quot; &quot; Neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of the nerve cells among each other . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably mainly known as &quot; &quot; full @-@ piece &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ t@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ t@@ amin and Dop@@ amine , but in less measurements than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ t@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , making psychological or man@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re @-@ determination of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ections solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that have been increased to a period of two hours .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and Plac@@ ebo , in a different study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and Plac@@ ebo , in a different study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and Plac@@ ebo , which have been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ pol@@ ar@@ able disorder that was increased by Lor@@ i ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and Plac@@ ebo via a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change of symptoms were investigated using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients treated to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company led to studies , in order to investigate how the body can take the melt @-@ tab@@ let@@ ins and the solution to take action ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the injection techniques , patients showed a significant reduction in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction of symptoms increased more than the patients who received a Plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder in four of the five Kur@@ zz@@ es studies in four of the five Kur@@ ds studies are effective as Plac@@ ebo .

&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , s@@ mi@@ tis ( mat@@ ern@@ ation ) , s@@ laughter ( mat@@ ern@@ ation ) , s@@ laughter ( lemon ) , s@@ ali@@ p@@ ation ( amor@@ ph@@ ew ) , s@@ ali@@ p@@ ation ( amor@@ ph@@ ew ) , s@@ ali@@ p@@ ation ( amor@@ ph@@ ew ) , s@@ ali@@ p@@ ation ( amor@@ ph@@ al ) , s@@ ali@@ p@@ ation , In@@ som@@ p@@ ation , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) was carried out to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and severe pain in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , against the risks associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ections for patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic infections in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission reported the European Commission in Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe . &quot;
AB@@ LE F@@ Y is for the treatment of heavy up to heavy man@@ t@@ astic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had previously worked for the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ LE F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a reduction rate of 15 mg / day one day independent of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dosing over a day do@@ sis of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended initial dose for AB@@ LE F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ LE F@@ Y in treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ ophysi@@ cs - disorder in patients with 65 years have been proven .
&quot; with regard to the bigger sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis should be drawn if clinical factors should justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor can be removed from the combination of combination , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ pre@@ valence of psychological diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no result in patients with bi@@ polar disorder in comparison with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with the treatment of patients with known kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ atric diseases , diseases that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony frac@@ ture , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ ution , treatment with blood pressure sen@@ sing treatment ) or hyper@@ tension ( including aqu@@ eous and mal@@ ig@@ ne ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which was a year or less , there was no reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; when using AB@@ AC@@ F@@ Y patients , signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie should be moved to reduce the dose or treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a M@@ NS , or in@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti @-@ psychological manifestation including AB@@ LE F@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ons in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or for states that are used with cr@@ amp@@ ings in connection with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osom@@ al patients , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with high dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the use of un@@ predictable events in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Comp@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances , including AB@@ LE F@@ Y . &quot;
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ LE F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic substances which allow direct failure .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ ans , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk of@@ diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored using diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; in general with bi@@ polar patients and patients with bi@@ pol@@ arized patients and patients with bi@@ polar bears , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , which could lead to serious complications and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; because of the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in combination with alcohol , or other centrally effective drugs can be taken with excessive side effects ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ oti@@ din , a Mag@@ ic@@ ic acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ p@@ chart rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , with this effect as a clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy subjects , the au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol for 107 % , while the C@@ rate remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ ic@@ tin and par@@ ox@@ et@@ tin , similar effects and therefore should be similar to similar D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ induc@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; in addition to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; T &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol result in comparison to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective c@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits potential potential risks for patients . &quot;
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ proteins have similar effects and therefore should be similar to similar D@@ os@@ is@@ re@@ induc@@ ement .
&quot; depending on the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ LE F@@ Y is on the D@@ os@@ is@@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ aff@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with AB@@ LE F@@ Y , can be found with an increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials showed a significant effect on the met@@ asta@@ sis of the substrates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ mb@@ or@@ ph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ phi@@ ph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should avoid their physician if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; due to in@@ adequate data , it is not only used in pregnancy and due to the reproduction studies in the pregnancy , unless the possible benefit of the potential of potential is able to increase the potential risk of F@@ ö@@ p . &quot;
&quot; in addition to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be aware of dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , including strength vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol will have no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects were more frequently than in Plac@@ ebo or with a possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) .
&quot; the frequency of the above side effects is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in a Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under Plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a different controlled study period , 26 weeks were treated by EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients that were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15,@@ 1 % of patients at O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
in a controlled study with Bi@@ ophysi@@ cal I disorder - In a controlled study of EPS 23,@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ osis treatment .
&quot; in a different study about 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long time period , over 26 weeks with a Plac@@ ebo of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Plac@@ ebo , where potential clin@@ ically significant changes of the routines , have not been a serious problem . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and supplements were observed in 3.5 % of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol patients were observed in comparison to 2.0 % of the treated patients . &quot;
&quot; on the side effects that occur in connection with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ es@@ ie and cr@@ amp@@ ings in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials and since the market launch were un@@ intended , un@@ intended or ab@@ err@@ ations with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with estimated delivery of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; however , there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ modified ly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is a high plasma treatment . &quot;
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and Bi@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high impact on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a -@@ 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dosing , from 0.5 to 30 mg once every day via 2 weeks to healthy subjects showed a high @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D3 @-@ receptor , on the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; in three Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison with positive or negative symptoms showed , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in comparison to Plac@@ ebo has significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dium @-@ controlled study was 52 of the proportion of the individual patients who were similar to the study medi@@ ator , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ des 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measured values , which were defined as secondary research goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sam @-@ scale , showed significantly more intense improvement than with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ als . &quot;
&quot; in a Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks to stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , an significantly higher reduction of return rate which is at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % . &quot;
&quot; in a O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study with Sch@@ iz@@ z@@ ol ( N = 18 or 13 % of the primary patient listing ) , under the average weight of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. a increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) at a average weight of ca . &quot;
in two Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed choir of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in a Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with high dosage for patients with a man@@ ic or mixed choir of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were not excessive . &quot;
&quot; in two years of patients , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a bi@@ polar disorder in two weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed choir of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic conclusions . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol proved to be a comparable proportion of patients with sy@@ mptom@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ie as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ als .
&quot; in a Plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed choir of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a higher efficacy in the reduction of hormon@@ al symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • O@@ ste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , the bone spr@@ inkl@@ ed ) both for women after the exchange of years than in men . &quot;
&quot; it will be applied to patients with a high level of disease ( bone ) , including patients who recently recently changed a minimal bite like when they have recently changed . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
patients with Mor@@ bus can get at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for minimum 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be obtained before the first In@@ fusion ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by inj@@ tion in a muscle .

&quot; since the active substance in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a &apos;s evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of vert@@ eb@@ ul@@ tural and hip frac@@ tures about a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years .
&quot; by Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies at a total of 35@@ 7 patients and six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( one of other Bis@@ cuits ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was , whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( a enzymes , bone sub@@ lime ) in the blood is again normal or at least 75 % compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ orials are reduced by Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ fication ) over a period of three years in comparison to the patients under Plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ fication ) , which reduces the risk of hip frac@@ tures around 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under Plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of acet@@ la@@ sta within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent .
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other Bis@@ cuits , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; as with all the bis@@ cuits , patients are subject to patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s risk of kidney disease , reaction to the in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ist and oste@@ ot@@ on@@ ec@@ tious disease ( die by bone tissue ) in pine trees . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides an explan@@ atory material for doctors , the Ac@@ la@@ sta to treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence contains such as the medicine , as well as similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drugs should be explained . &quot;

for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intra@@ ven@@ ous In@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once annually .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the adoption of the In@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get only from doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus .
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta has been observed with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ plen@@ ary period with patients who have found on therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient criterion of calcium , according to twice a minimum of 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently discovered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ E. or in@@ tro @-@ In@@ fusion is recommended for the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by a gift of par@@ ach@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ f shortly after the application of acet@@ la@@ sta . &quot;
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) of patients with an Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min will be recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
&quot; older patients ( R@@ 65 years ) A D@@ os@@ is@@ ement is not necessary , since the bi@@ ph@@ arm@@ ability , distribution and Eli@@ min@@ ation in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years since the data are missing and effective .
&quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because it is not recommended for this patient population only limited clinical experience . &quot;
a pre @-@ existing hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia treatment occurs before the treatment of calcium and vitamin D to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick release of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid to bone frac@@ ture can develop a temporary , sometimes sy@@ mptom@@ atic Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia function , whose maximum usually within the first 10 days after the In@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure that patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient criterion of calcium , according to twice a minimum of 500 mg of calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer immun@@ otherapy , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , bad mouth hygiene , should be used to treat breast cancer treatment with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients , patients need no data to be available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ cuits are reduced in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be based on the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after adoption of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by a gift of par@@ ach@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ f shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

abstract of the Order of 24 September 2015
Ac@@ tos will be applied to treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially excessive patients ) , which can not be adjusted in the highest possible dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ or@@ n@@ ated or insulin in the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better distributed and the blood sugar levels , thus reducing type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ sis , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ated , in addition to 3.5 years long . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ em@@ bla@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as good of the blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which leaves the blood sugar values at the use of dosing of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of an additional gift of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ ated in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values for 0.@@ 94 % , while the extra gift of Plac@@ ebo has led to 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients , patients , Ac@@ tos were investigated for insulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos , tend@@ ons , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold water ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ ker@@ ie ( reduced sensitivity compared to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used for patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart disease or diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the frame of a mon@@ otherapy ( in case of some use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , where met@@ form@@ is not displayed . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission on the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited offers a permit for the In@@ struction of Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union . &quot;

&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days are no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to be an activation of specific core receptor in the animal model , which leads to elevated insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is reduced to glucose production in the liver and the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ amine in the case of insulin resistance .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bone are used ) of women after the men@@ op@@ ause , when a risk of low vitamin D @-@ D mirror is used for a low vitamin D @-@ D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patio has a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or take other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vitamins ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid the food intake , the patient can be carried out to the first food intake of the day , which should not be carried out after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 already be used separately in the European Union , the company laid the company data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also led to a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis due to increase the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to increase the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ w@@ alled treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D @-@ D mirror were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those that were only al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also included data before that that the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE are exactly the dose which is required for the use of a bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ ature ( muscles , bone or joints ) and the symptoms of the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ eal ) , s@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ eal ) , rec@@ lassi@@ fication ( can@@ als ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with adequate sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied to diseases of the food safety , for patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low cal@@ um@@ bing mirror ) or in patients who can stand at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or take care of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vitamins ) for the day . &quot;
the following notes are precisely to follow the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al friction and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be made according to the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not be broken or tobacco in the mouth , since there is no risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the physician is therefore atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms that should be carried out on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and the patient should be aware of the occur@@ rence of symptoms such as dy@@ spher@@ es , pain at the occur@@ rence of symptoms or new or even worse so@@ d@@ burn . &quot;
3 The risk of severe pain side effects seems to be increased to patients who is not correctly correctly and / or after the occur@@ rence of symptoms that can be found on a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ v@@ ale Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions on patients are understood and understood by patients ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during the large @-@ clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was found , rarely ( according to market ) Mag@@ ician and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some serious and complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to give evidence , whether the removal of a bis@@ cuits therapy in patients who need a surgical procedure , the risk of a oste@@ opor@@ osis of the pine shafts . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is a decisive factor for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be aware that they should be able to take a dose of any dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet on the next morning after they have noticed .
&quot; they should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking care of a tablet per week as originally planned on the planned date . &quot;
other diseases related to the minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should be treated before the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can be taken into consideration when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore the patients need to wait at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific application studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken into clinical trials with a variety of usually used drugs , without the clin@@ ically relevant exchange effects . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not responsible for pregnant women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no reference to the nec@@ essi@@ ties of pregnancy , embry@@ onic stem cells or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers was reported in patients with bis@@ cuits , but most reports from cancer patients were reported in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ te . &quot;

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ ity therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ting patients , this medicine should take place or changes in immun@@ ity therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or increased inci@@ dence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ otherapy . &quot;
patients should always be made by the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transfer of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ ined control of one in transplan@@ t @-@ transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a sequence of an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug must be carried out in order to ensure that the systematic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains to ensure that the systematic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains to ensure that the system@@ ic position of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ancement should be primarily associated with clinical assessment of rejection and compensation in the case and on blood level regulations ( see below ) .

&quot; there is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State . &quot;
the information in clinical studies showed that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the Tal@@ bot is not exceed in the blood of 20 ng / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the Tal@@ bot of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with the heart @-@ gra@@ ined patient at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the search therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation were usually used in blood concentration in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ tation or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ thrown . &quot;
patients should always be made by the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transfer of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the eng@@ ined control of one in transplan@@ t @-@ transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation in adult heart transplan@@ tation and transplan@@ tation in the child , nor does not contain clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ding formulation . &quot;
&quot; due to potential interactions that can lead to a her@@ ding of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is to avoid re@@ productive preparation for patients ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ h@@ ö , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentration levels in blood vessels , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances can be considerable variations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f is known as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , who can be treated as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; other factors affecting the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid , kidney or liver disorders . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ o@@ res@@ si@@ va , the penetration of sunlight or UV light because of the possible risk of mal@@ nutrition , alter@@ ations by suitable clothes or use of a sunlight with a high level of protection . &quot;

&quot; based on the first approval of your data , the CH@@ MP the benefit risk reduction continues to be positively evaluated , but consider the safety profile of the following reasons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP is required for the basis of the security fil@@ ing of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is necessary to apply for the approval of PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited presented to the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company can be re@@ active in the treatment of Li @-@ women &apos;s treatment for the treatment of Li @-@ women &apos;s treatment . &quot;

&quot; this means that the tablets can be set up so that the tablets are placed so that one of the most effective ingredient immediately and the other slowly spread over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for the treatment of the seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y infections ) in patients with nas@@ al infections ( c@@ op@@ ause nose ) .
&quot; for adults and young people from 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze twice a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the length of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose of the nas@@ al nose . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicines can be found in the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main objective dimensions were the changes of the cause of the hypo@@ gl@@ ary symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study carried out the patients all 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard sk@@ ala as difficult to have symptoms in the last 12 hours .
&quot; in the case of all hypo@@ gl@@ ary symptoms of the nose of the nose reported the patients who reported aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of symptoms of 4@@ 6,0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients that pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al loop , the patient showed a lens of the symptoms of 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % of the patients , the Des@@ p@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , t@@ ul@@ cer@@ tis , de@@ hydr@@ ation , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , head@@ ache , in@@ som@@ nia ( ur@@ gency ) , sleep disorders and ner@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be sensitive to patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other components against allergi@@ es , or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine prescribed for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also be used in patients who are treated with hyper@@ tension ( increased eye pressure ) , cardiovascular disease ( over@@ flow pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ oph@@ ile ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission published the European Commission to the company SP Europe , the European Commission adopted by Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , in the whole . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied to the lack of data for in@@ accur@@ acies and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years .
the duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued .
it is recommended to limit the application period to 10 days since they can reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with time .
&quot; after a decline in the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the top breathing , the treatment can be carried out with Des@@ er@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
the medicine may also be used in patients with chronic oxid@@ ase ( Ma@@ o ) inhibit@@ ors or can be treated within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment .
&quot; this is based on the not@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , Per@@ go@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ o , Cab@@ erg@@ o , Cab@@ inet , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ ot@@ ent or other de@@ crimin@@ ation ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ to@@ ot@@ eric ) , phen@@ y@@ le@@ fi@@ é , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ ine , Nap@@ haz@@ ard , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested and the data are not tested for the patient treatment .
the safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested with kidney or liver function in patients with kidney or liver function .
patients need to be informed that the treatment in relation to hyper@@ tension or a t@@ rough@@ or by pal@@ atal disorders such as head@@ ache or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( like head@@ ache or a reinforcement of head@@ ache ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with heart rhyth@@ mic disorders • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ in in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , bladder cancer or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ sions in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of the mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine often occurs positive reactions on indicators for skin actions or in their income . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ p@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were observed , however , there were no clin@@ ically relevant exchange effects or changes of the plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; due to the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ omy tests , there were no significant differences between associated with Des@@ p@@ at@@ adi@@ n and with the Plac@@ ebo patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or alcohol was taken . &quot;
the met@@ aph@@ ors of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n enzymes was not identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded .
&quot; in vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , in vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is non @-@ inhibit@@ ing and neither a substr@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ co@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; during pregnancy , the in@@ fertility of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected families , however , not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency during normal population . &quot;
&quot; however , reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and on the reason of the v@@ as@@ o@@ con@@ ical properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be sure that there may be very rare cases that can be used in very rare cases that can lead to a supply of traffic or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ aling , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ a , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely for children , as well as A@@ tro@@ pin @-@ typical Sy@@ mptoms , P@@ up@@ ill@@ ar@@ et and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin skin and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms . &quot;
&quot; these include both in@@ hibition of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Ma@@ st@@ al cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dose study with adults , Des@@ p@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes of the river , including the reinforcement of subjective resistance or the tasks which are connected with the air@@ plane . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage may result in the recommended dosage , such as a increase of blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ ate or manifestation of a Z@@ NS arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients at the age of 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic to the part , whereby 414 patients were aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ ories of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total control for the symptoms ( except nose grinding ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ w@@ inged treatment period . &quot;

&quot; if the physician should be checked only if the doctor has checked , the anti @-@ viral medicines of the patient has taken the patient , and the probability that the virus has to be found on the drugs . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day that will be taken together with twice daily 100 mg ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of A@@ generic ase after body weight .

main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the share of patients with non @-@ effective concentrations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load according to treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients that had previously made no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant , after 48 weeks after the treatment of a virus under 400 copies / ml as under Plac@@ ebo , but A@@ generic is less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for children , however , the virus may also treated the virus from the children who were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ seh , but only very few to the treatment . &quot;

&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission published the European Commission from Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited : a permit for the In@@ struction of A@@ generic , in the whole European Union . &quot;
A@@ generic ase is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , Prot@@ e@@ as@@ el@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ generic capsules for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r , together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r should be made under consideration of the individual viral resistance and the pre@@ treatment of the patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bi@@ ph@@ e@@ ability of Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r is a solution to take 14 % less than am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for use on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram can &apos;t be ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r twice daily , with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; 2 If the generic capsules can be applied without the reinforced replacement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses at A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) are applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines until a day of the highest dose of 2400 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the phar@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and security of A@@ generic ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ites were not investigated for children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic ase is not recommended for the application for children under 4 years , because of the lack of data for dis@@ comfort and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics data , the dose of A@@ generic capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
the simultaneous application is to be used in patients with light or excessive liver function with caution when patients with severe liver function is contra@@ ven@@ ous ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; A@@ generic ase is not at the same time with medicines , which have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ ron P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;

patients should be aware that aphor@@ ically or any other anti@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti @-@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic ase does not prevent the risk of transfer from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .

patients treated to chronic hep@@ atitis B or C are treated with a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy .
&quot; in case of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ reduced risk function including a chron@@ ically active hep@@ atitis is increased frequency of liver function under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ generic 3@@ A4 ( see section 4.5 ) is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment of system@@ ic corrosion caused by the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 size ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the processing of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ induc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin was strongly dependent on the increased risk of my@@ ri@@ ad , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , is not recommended . &quot;

&quot; in patients who take these medicines simultaneously , A@@ generic gases can be less effective ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metaboli@@ c interactions with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ an can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if Meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time , the patient should be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ric acid , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity , due to the high @-@ prop@@ yl ly@@ col@@ lo@@ sis of the A@@ generic solution , these dar@@ ts can be used for children under a age of four years , and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups . &quot;
ab@@ ase should be set to duration 5 . if a skin irrit@@ ation of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .

&quot; if a patient already takes a patient , the Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ an effect is possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and check the cur@@ ial . &quot;
it is not necessary to use an D@@ os@@ en@@ oid for one of the medicine if they are fin@@ avi@@ r together with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r . ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is included in combination with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
clinical trials were used in clinical trials were applied by 600 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily .
52 % reduced if Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg BB@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is reached approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a do@@ cking recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will not be known as the effectiveness and injustice of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ al study for use in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ os@@ in and ab@@ ase at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
this is therefore a gift of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , because the ex@@ position of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ el@@ mer would be low . &quot;
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ el@@ mer and existing limited data , that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r may be lowers . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is to be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is less effective or effective . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring shall be made , as a precise predic@@ tive effect of the combination of Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;

Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ generic @-@ yc@@ yc@@ in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out but could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once used to increase the c@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in the plasma by 25 % and the au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 0 ) to the 2.7 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other drugs , which are listed below are listed below , including Sub@@ str@@ ate , Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ generic 3@@ A4 . &quot;
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions which are used with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ generic ase .
&quot; based on the data of other proteins , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ generic drugs . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va which are known as enzymes are known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , Carb@@ oni@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r can lead to a reduction of the plas@@ m@@ r@@ asp@@ berries of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentration camp by Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ig@@ ames , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , @-@ pin , @-@ pin , @-@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in combination with A@@ generic , the plas@@ ma@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with hyp@@ ot@@ ub@@ ility , tend@@ ons and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generic meth@@ yl is not recommended , it is because that the possible benefit of a treatment for the risk of system@@ ic corrosion test ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions in terms of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to draw the current interpre@@ t@@ ative systems to analyse the results of resistance tests . &quot;
in conjunction with the gen@@ otype or Fos@@ k@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ el@@ mer @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .

the early removal of an excessive therapy is recommended to keep the c@@ ort@@ ation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the following treatment .
&quot; in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with lower Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred three @-@ six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with subsequent virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least one of another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the partial study of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis made the non @-@ under@@ statement of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in the plasma after 16 weeks .
&quot; in the age of 2 to 18 years , it is based on two un@@ controll@@ able trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ aged children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 was treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution to take @-@ up and capsules in dosing of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , while the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
the majority of PI patients were given at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of which had been preserved at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study carried out a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medit@@ ate increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Ba@@ zar@@ end to these data should be considered in therapy optimization with PI @-@ treated children of the use of &quot; un@@ tru@@ sive &quot; A@@ generic .
&quot; according to or@@ isation , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for c@@ max to 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the adoption of Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the au@@ c , but has no effect on concentration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) of the food intake is influenced by the food intake and the rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the higher distribution volume is approximately 430 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as a growing penetration of Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ disturbed am@@ ic@@ avi@@ an , which is probably the active part of the active part . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ disturbed ampl@@ itude is constant , the percentage of the free active active part of the free active therapeutic concentration in the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is necessary to use the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induced or in@@ hi@@ b@@ ish or a substr@@ ate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ; with caution , when they are given at the same time with A@@ generic 3@@ A4 ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r @-@ Ex@@ position as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bi@@ parti@@ tioning than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ generic capsules does not require on a milli@@ liter basis .
it is also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to negl@@ ect the impact of a kidney function to the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment plants lead to Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ tics which are comparable to healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous appointment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for rab@@ bits with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ an in mice and rats , with male animal cavi@@ r in mice and rats , the ex@@ position of the Ex@@ position on people , according to twice a daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , said . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of the hep@@ ato@@ id Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not pursued and the relevance of these audi@@ tory effects for people is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery from In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro tests , the bacterial test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test test . &quot;
this liver disease can be monitored at clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; however , clinical trials still have been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ generic , nor after the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity , which are treated from a age of 4 days , were treated both in the control and with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ rus animals a high degree of mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; at a system@@ ic plas@@ ma@@ vera , the significant changes in patients were significantly higher ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) , however , a number of slightly different changes , including th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and significant skel@@ etal changes that were observed on a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If the generic capsules may be applied without the reinforced replacement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses at A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) are applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines until a day of the highest dose of 2400 mg am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is used in patients with weak or light liver function with caution , when patients with severe liver function is a contra@@ vention ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines , the serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Carb@@ az@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lical anti @-@ depres@@ sive anti @-@ inflammatory conditions ( under supervision of the International Standards Agency ) , are available for determination of the active substance concentration . &quot;
ab@@ ase should be set on duration 27 . if a skin irrit@@ ation of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; a higher risk of li@@ ana@@ yst@@ ro@@ phi@@ e has been associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with medicines . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in the au@@ c of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r causes , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is included in combination with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is reached approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
&quot; a do@@ cking recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it will not be known as the effectiveness and injustice of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , because the ex@@ position of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ el@@ mer would be low . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring shall be made , as a precise predic@@ tive effect of the combination of Am@@ ac@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is needed for clinical reasons , Ri@@ pp@@ u@@ tin are required to take a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ vers@@ u@@ tin on at least the half of the recommended dose of 31 , although it is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentration camp by Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ig@@ ames , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , black @-@ pin , cross @-@ pin , @-@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine . &quot;

&quot; for simultaneous usage of war@@ p or other or@@ al anti anti@@ bodies together with A@@ generic , a stronger control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Agency ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 m@@ eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r at 22 % .

&quot; in addition to adults and children from 4 years , clinical trials was examined in combination with various other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , the necessary support measures are required . &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both at ak@@ ut and chronic cell cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;

&quot; the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : magni@@ fied liver , sti@@ cking joints , conduc@@ tive lung volume , heart rate and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ure should be monitored by a doctor in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other metaboli@@ c metaboli@@ c diseases .
&quot; the adoption of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ es should be made in a hospital or a clinic with res@@ sources of cancer , and patients need appropriate drugs to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the safety of the medicines was examined in the study mainly due to its effect on the reduction of the G@@ AG concentrations in Ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver . &quot;
&quot; when children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ate the G@@ AG concentration camps in the Ur@@ ine around around 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ure in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , pain in the Gli@@ ed@@ onian ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fu@@ sions ( in hands and feet ) . &quot;

&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission adopted the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. an approval for the In@@ duction of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ure in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ en α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ able DNA technology under use by CH@@ O @-@ acid @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ O@@ vary , eggs of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ um is to treat the long @-@ term enzymes in patients with enhanced diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ l @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestation of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ és should be made by a physician who is made in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other er@@ ectile dysfunction .
&quot; the initial in@@ fu@@ sions rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ure at adults about 65 years have been not detected and for this patient can &apos;t be recommended for the patient treatment .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ um in patients with kidney or liver disease was not detected , and for these patients may be recommended for patients . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ tivis@@ m patients , patients can develop in@@ fu@@ sion@@ able reactions which are defined as any in the secondary level , which is defined as each in the side effects of the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should also continue to be monitored and the In@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ate should only be used in a reasonable clinical environment , in the res@@ sources of medical emergency cases . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients receive Ig@@ G si@@ RNA against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with the use of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ es with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience regarding the re@@ alignment of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a long @-@ sensitive reaction after a break of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of the In@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ static ) prefer@@ ential reactions to minim@@ ise potential occur@@ ren@@ ces .
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ heavy @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ an@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ ro@@ er@@ oll@@ s , and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate at half of the in@@ fusion rate , when the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ary reaction , the in@@ fusion must be brought to the decline in the decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ an@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ se is weak@@ ened . &quot;
the In@@ fusion can be used with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fu@@ sion@@ rate where the reaction occurred .

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ate should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ in , because there is potential risk of an inter@@ rog@@ ation with the intra@@ ocular lens of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies allow not to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new born , which have been removed from Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to bre@@ ast@@ feeding during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the side effects in clinical trials were mainly used as in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ed reactions , which have been observed in the phase 2 @-@ 3 study ( treatment time up to 4 years ) and with 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment times up to 1 year ) . &quot;
&quot; un@@ desirable medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ es , which were observed during the phase of 5 years or older at a total of 45 years or older than a treatment period of 5 years , are often observed in the following table : very often ( Acts 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with heavier M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ un@@ equ@@ alled participation of the upper respiratory tract , and lungs in the pre@@ history of the early respiratory tract , breathing , and facial hair ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with a total of 20 patients were found in the age of 5 years , with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with mainly severe loss of treatment and a treatment period of up to 12 months , are reported in the table . &quot;

&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ans were examined in a prospective study , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; for the study , the majority of the patients were transferred to the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient described the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were modified when they had an inter@@ continental volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to go to 6 minutes to stand and 5 metres .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the process change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute path in the 6 @-@ minute drive .
&quot; all patients were then returned to an open label extension , where they received more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ ari . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who are not treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and patients who have previously received other chemotherapy as a few treatment . &quot;
in order to reduce side effects during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta , together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , you should be given before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition to the gift of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition to a fluid deficiency . &quot;
&quot; in patients , their blood image changes or during which certain side effects should occur , should be removed or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ es slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to share the cells .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ es in its active form is easier to be used in cancer cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active substance and a longer active effect in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study to 4@@ 56 patients , which had not yet received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ aqu@@ atic lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta has been treated with local advanced or met@@ ast@@ atic disease , which had already been treated with a chemotherapy , with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with mix@@ tures in a study with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who had to have no chemotherapy for lung cancer .

&quot; furthermore , we have to show that the data for the stability of the active substance and the market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which was similar to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to the clinical study . &quot;
after setting of the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ing the disease in more patients come back to a reference contract ; also Alph@@ eon more side effects .
&quot; apart from this in the study test , the test test for the investigation of the question , which the medicine is a immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently validated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ush formation ) and small cavi@@ ties ( Ris@@ ing or chi@@ ves ) , de@@ par@@ tures and gen@@ ders . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used for patients from nine months , but at the age of 18 years , the skin surface is not more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patient after two to three days , the physician should examine the physician to investigate patients and alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ses ( the parts of bacteria in which proteins are produced ) and inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ ces of the effectiveness was in all five trials of the proportion of patients whose infection was treated after the treatment of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of the 71 patients under Plac@@ ebo .
Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar means : if the results of both studies at the skin were collected about 90 % of the patients of both groups of both groups .
&quot; however , in these two studies were found that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by infections ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections , which were not effective or perhaps caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effects with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a travel to the supplier .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) corresponds to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go , the following surface treatment of the surface treatment : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , de@@ par@@ tures or gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission published the European Commission of Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. , called by Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in the case of two to three days , the patients shall not be examined in two to three days , even with an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a sensitivity or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation due to the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken , the sal@@ be carefully and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection will be started . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of infections , for example , MR@@ SA is known to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or referred to ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;

the impact of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means at the same skin is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved by top@@ ical use on the skin or the surface of the surface , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ dex@@ tro@@ us is used to protect against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases , which are applied to the liver ) of children aged between one and 15 years , which are still not im@@ pregn@@ ated against these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ dex@@ tro@@ us is used in the frame of a two @-@ cans of existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may possibly be achieved after use of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ ent should only be used when the immune system is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and ensure that the vacc@@ ine plan can be led to the end of two cans . &quot;

there are some of the data that used the use of Twin@@ rix adults and also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ ent .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the share of the old children who had developed a month after the last inj@@ ections .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of vacc@@ ine is compared to a six @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protective measures are similar to a single and 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ dex@@ s ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine ) are head@@ ache , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fi@@ bers ( fatigue ) and friction . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ dex@@ s must respond to patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( a research ) . &quot;

&quot; but in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine has been limited due to the low degree of patient . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used in patients at age of over one month with a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ phs or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary opathy ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ ia is divided - split by several single species to the meals - split under the stomach or a nose ( through the abdominal hose ) or a nose ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
&quot; it was not a comparable study , since Am@@ mon@@ ia does not have to be compared with any other treatment or with Plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ aches , i.e. without agent ) . &quot;
&quot; am@@ mon@@ ia can also be used for app@@ rais@@ al , an ab@@ duc@@ tive m@@ amm@@ ate in blood , depression , mu@@ c@@ ation , head@@ ache , smell , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , skin or weight loss . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) corresponds to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ g in patients with mal@@ function of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ia treatment .
am@@ mon@@ ia was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as due to the selection of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the use of all patients who have a complete end@@ othel@@ ial deficiency in the first 28 liver ( within the first 28 Leb@@ enst@@ age ) .
&quot; in patients with a late study solid form ( in@@ appropriate En@@ z@@ ym@@ phs , after the first life balance ) is then an indication for the use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese En@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children , who are not able to s@@ wal@@ low or for patients with gor@@ ck@@ disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually toler@@ ated under consideration of the protein toler@@ ant and the development of the daily protein absorption of the patients .
&quot; after the existing clinical experience , the normal daily dose is sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of 20 kg , as well as a growing and adult adults . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who suffer an early treatment of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ li@@ at@@ ul@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitu@@ tion of Cit@@ ron or Ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be toxic in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 kg / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not exceed patients with gor@@ ck@@ disorders because there is a risk for the formation of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet ® AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium around 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium chl@@ oride tablets which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be applied to patients with con@@ dens@@ ation or severe kidney disease as well as with sodium .
since Met@@ aboli@@ sm and ex@@ changer of sodium chl@@ oride in patients with liver and kidney disease should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney disease .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore a Indian ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ cut@@ outs of phen@@ yl@@ meth@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 47@@ 4 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal distortion and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it was also a delayed res@@ titu@@ tion of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ sen , and a reduced number of functional nervous disorders in the brain and thus a disability of brain users . &quot;
&quot; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding is the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the down@@ time , the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the down@@ time ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox treatment will be applied to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ ty Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest strap with different strength ) or M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ants ( heart failure ) or M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ ust ( heart failure ) . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox is used for prevention of blood cl@@ auses in patients who are used to take a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can be continued until four hours after operation .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
about 14 000 patients have been compared to the main study on the treatment of An@@ gi@@ ox / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ cin@@ or ( G@@ PI ) which was compared with a gly@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation ( G@@ PI ) and a G@@ PI @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) .
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a tri@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the Ar@@ ter@@ ie in order to prevent a lock in order to prevent a lock in order to prevent blood pressure , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in the failure of new events ( deaths , heart failure or Rev@@ eals ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as the traditional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the case of patients who were signed a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in relation to all indicators like he@@ par@@ in , except in severe blood vessels , in which it was considerably more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or other components . &quot;
&quot; it may also be used in patients with strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems , or a heart attack . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) corresponds to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission published the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd , a permit for the In@@ struction of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ rays ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ mid@@ range inf@@ ants ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , for a emergency stop or when a early intervention is scheduled . &quot;
the recommended initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt from 0.1 mg / kg followed by a In@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is performed in another episode , an additional bolts of 0.5 mg / kg , and the In@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h can be increased . &quot;
after the PCI can be added to clinical requirements the reduced induction dose from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; directly before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by a In@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg weight and one of the following intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg weight weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a all@@ ot@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended if a short PCI procedure is planned .
this value ( main@@ page after 5 minutes ) can be short@@ ened to 225 seconds . a second bolt from 0.3 mg / kg / body weight are done .
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of low power values , the re@@ frac@@ tion@@ able and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis can be replaced with intra@@ ven@@ ous membrane . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the main@@ value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fu@@ sion@@ sis is right correctly . &quot;
&quot; for patients with medium severe kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are used to be treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , should be a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
the main@@ value of 225 seconds is a second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis of 0.3 mg / kg and the main@@ 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis .

patients are carefully treated with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood circulation , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in combination with another an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the PCI patient under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , most of the blood vessels , may occur in patients that occur in a per@@ mal@@ ign@@ ite Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ otti ( PCI ) , while the treatment can occur anywhere in any blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; in addition to patients who are treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards Agency ) should be moved to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is achieved before the treatment of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the active mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ules ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ mb@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ite or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ure ) can be determined to increase the blood circulation . &quot;
&quot; in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ c@@ lical units , the clinical and biological tests are the clinical and biological path@@ ology parameters in any case regularly . &quot;

&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed below are listed according to the comprehensive application in practice , and are ordered by system organic classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ t is immediately to break and break the patient with regard to signs of blood circulation . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need a treatment with insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ an ( under the skin ) in the pan@@ cre@@ as or upper arm or the upper arm or as a permanent fusion of insulin .
diabetes is an illness in which the body does not have enough insulin in the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in blood or insulin .
&quot; insulin pens are very slightly significant of human@@ ities , and the change means that it is faster than a short @-@ effective human consumption than a short @-@ effective human@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin for patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body does not produce insulin in patients with a total of 5@@ 72 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body insulin are not effective in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance of cosmic gly@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.2 % to 7.2 % ) compared to insulin resistance by 0.@@ 14 % . &quot;
&quot; for adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0.0@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared with A@@ pi@@ dra compared with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,@@ 30 % . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin resistance or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted when it is together with a number of other medicines , which may affect blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 the European Commission adopted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH , a permit for the In@@ struction of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is available as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ectors either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the upper jaw or the dol@@ ite , or sub@@ cut@@ out by continuous In@@ fusion in the area of the pan@@ de@@ - . &quot;
due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin treatment can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
&quot; any change of the operation , the brand ( her@@ on ) , of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ inc@@ tion etc . ) , the type of insulin ( e.g. insulin in ) and / or the production method can change a change of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or the collapse of a treatment , especially in patients with an adult diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ onics ; these conditions are potential life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient should be carried out on another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer in close medical supervision and can be necessary to take a change of dosage .
the treatment of a hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia depends on the treatment of the insulin used and can therefore change the treatment of the treatment .
&quot; anti @-@ oxid@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may increase blood sugar levels and inc@@ lin@@ ation of hy@@ po@@ ds , flu@@ oride , flu@@ oride , flu@@ oride , flu@@ oride , flu@@ oride , and sul@@ fon@@ yl acet@@ ate antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , among the effect of Sym@@ path@@ ia like Bet@@ ab@@ ling , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reserve the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ame @-@ regulation or missing . &quot;
animal studies showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ lis@@ ine and human@@ ities in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin lu@@ lis@@ le in the human breast milk , but in general occurs insulin in neither those in the mother &apos;s milk , nor will be res@@ um@@ ed according to or@@ derly application . &quot;

heavy Hy@@ po@@ ds with consciousness can be made by glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which will be treated by a prescribed person or by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of gluten by a physician .
the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to identify the ur@@ ine effects for heavy Hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cular muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be done by insulin resistance and the active duration is shorter than a hu@@ g normal normal fat .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - Tu@@ S showed insulin dosing range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , or a lower weight of a cosmic effect , precisely as human@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; insulin resistance has a double as fast efficiency , such as normal human@@ ities and the complete isolation of the effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin resistance in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ ure control will be achieved , such as human normal normal dose , 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin resistance in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ ure control is given a better post@@ ure control than with human normal normal fat , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin resistance in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gl@@ yc@@ ation control such as human normal normal fat , the 2 mi@@ ths of the meal will be given ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin resistance in a meal 2 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - prior ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human normal normal normal dose , 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min ) before beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin resistance in a gift of 15 minutes ( GL@@ UL@@ IS@@ IN - after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human@@ em days ( Figure 1@@ C ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
