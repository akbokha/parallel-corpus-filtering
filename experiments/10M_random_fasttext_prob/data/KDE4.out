what kind of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the pile processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for a original or a full picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option of met@@ adata in the Settings page of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; if you forget this , then you can select the met@@ adata from the database by using the appropriate point . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? &quot;
&quot; now you can select all images that you need to select the same attribute , and select the value . this makes sense , because you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us have to be used with keywords , keywords such as you are frequently asked , or the categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import the images from a different source with embedded samples , then the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag a sub@@ structures within a different source . &quot;
&quot; the graphic displays such as various met@@ adata itself , as every block of met@@ adata in truth from many sections . file names and calendar dates have the properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool for your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to see most of your photos just just see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not once a beautiful beach . if you want to view it , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that the Lan@@ de@@ field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha beach , in the French Nor@@ man@@ die . &quot;
&quot; for others the photos may be more important than the image itself is more important than the image itself to create a story . remember , the key is to tell you a story . think of the key to help Him about the motive you moves to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is in order when a picture is not perfect if it has only one image only with a labelling for itself alone .
&quot; K@@ DE provides you with a lot of text , in an internation@@ alized alph@@ abet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , which can be exported to your wishes and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city , without navigation system ? was it not a chicken planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train goes back with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ ocation will be able to export in the future . I am sure that one day , in the future , you can export the photos on the recording site . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ rights is a word game with copyright and called the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies .
the following description says that information on the loading side of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; as information should be shown :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for reference and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographer . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , the name of a company or organization should not be changed . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for link ) : it is the name of the photographer . examples of this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of examples can be the name of the photographer . examples of examples can be the name of the photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the vendor in order to identify the photo . this must not be simply the author . if the photographer has to be used for a news agency such as Reuters or associated Press , then the group / agency has to offer the picture . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill out the author and copyright of sections , although these are no protection against abuse . each of a little more than basic knowledge in work with computer , this is very important for the majority of your photos only by little interest . for professionals and Hal@@ b @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital image slider is unique in a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; it is a module for the pile processing .
&quot; topics : plate error , disk volume , current account , volume , transmission error , al@@ arms of the storage media , restore , de@@ und@@ ance , condition , data size , widespread stimulation &quot;
&quot; of course , we talk about CDs that are lost on the street or fire . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must have to be treated longer than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; O ; 2 pieces of a life period of 100 years of age . &quot;
&quot; you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider , and select Delete images .. from the HEAD and BODY tags and paste it in any place on your page where you want to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , even if you are just written about it . &quot;
&quot; there are also similar applications for defective CDs and DVDs , but there are also similar applications for the damaged data of damaged disk drives , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; visual Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format from the HD DVD to win the HD DVD with 8.5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs said , of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; you can also download the data on the next generation of media in a non @-@ proprietary format . read the data on the next generation of media , before you can read the data on the next generation hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
disc@@ o manufacturers retain their statistics for itself . their manufacturer &apos;s warranty include a new disk but not the data .
&quot; this is the most common error correction , SM@@ ART can not notice the fault rate of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . &quot;
&quot; it is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also re@@ produce data loss due to a power if you have secured the files without having great problems . &quot;
&quot; during the most electric drive current , it is not possible to use computers with computer chips and high speed processes . this may cause severe damage to your computer . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against electricity is an overload protection . this is a device that absor@@ b the energy source , and the rest . it is usually in shape of a connector bar . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a overload protection , then you should make sure that it is guaranteed to protect the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum . &quot;
&quot; there is also a telephone connection to your computer , you should also be aware that all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . these are also suitable for telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well as by these a over@@ voltage . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while a over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines , it can lead you to the loss of unwanted data . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unwanted data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection of over@@ tension , these devices can be used as battery energy as a power failure . this gives you the possibility to save your data and the system . some models allow them to be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overload protection . &quot;
&quot; you can take advantage of the potential risk that your computer system is exposed , and compare his safety at current problems with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs . &quot;
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the proper configuration you can use this as a backup under &amp; Linux ; and Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup solution for your software . &quot;
&quot; they are compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . this is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com &apos;s online storage services are available on the web . your free storage is available on 1 GB , and you will not get your pictures in full resolution . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . &quot;
&quot; the diagram features the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all the transmission systems are an@@ aero@@ bic for transfer error . the file system of Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs , at least the data integr@@ able between operating system and hard drive . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing is that there is no one that is in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ noticed until you have no protection in your hardware . no one seems to be destroyed in your computer . no one seems to be destroyed in your computer . no one seems to have a free connection to your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable net parts are a further source of transmission , since they generate inter@@ rup@@ tions within the data flows . in normal file systems remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not interested in the future , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS von Sun Micro@@ system seems to be one of two candidates who can handle with disk volume , and highly scal@@ able license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article on English . &quot;
&quot; this is always used in the Alpha Status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that uses the Z@@ FS software , and is also available for Linux ; it is not part of the core of the core . &quot;
&quot; these two factors are not responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less likely to be used for data loss as the proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , bow@@ el , J@@ FS and x@@ fs to call the more popular file systems . &quot;
&quot; however , if a file is not saved before a sudden break during a sudden break during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , a file doesn &apos;t be saved before the problem is lost . &quot;
viruses are the largest threat for digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main reasons for data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ ades settings of fundamental physical borders .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras can be used in the direction of 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the Optim@@ um for Compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher flexibility , you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; 6 % of all PCs are affected by a plan and test it for any data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a plan and test this backup before you do anything like the new installation of your operating system , exchange of boards or size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to make a flash drive on a external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash is not connected to the moment when the drive in the moment was not connected . &quot;
&quot; do not forget aircraft carrier : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are for your data dangerous enough . they usually require a whole room or the whole house . &quot;
Windows @-@ 12@@ 51 ( Cy@@ ril@@ lic ) windows @-@ 12@@ 51 ( Cy@@ ril@@ lic ) iso @-@ 8859 @-@ 8 @-@ i ( Arabic )
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the pan@@ ics . if you have a backup , then you can save the one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are secured . it is a time recording without hist@@ ories and provides a complete copy of a time .
differenti@@ ates : a backup of files that have changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete overview of two time points : the complete security and the last differentiation .
&quot; you can change the original status at any time , and create a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next one with the exception that it is only allowed and not to continue . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful tool that you can easily set up your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP seat or other types of file transfers , copied , and if you want to increase the safety over s@@ sh . &quot;
save important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or other op@@ acity medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and again . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly change for at least one month and a period for each month . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , in the image file stored , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ main@@ der images and met@@ adata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility ... &quot;
&quot; in order to survive the next 40 year , it is about the last 40 year you will be interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be taken into : &quot;
&quot; because the future of your nature is un@@ predictable , you must be able to view all the current system in the past . all 5 @-@ 8 years should you have questions like the current system backward . &quot;
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change the open standards which are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available today for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is simply : any time to change your computer architecture , your memory and f@@ umes technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a new standard . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always enlarge .
&quot; go to the top of the page , you want to copy the scal@@ ability with you and the area that you want to copy the scal@@ ability to a dedicated disk or partition . in * Email systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and make the new record at a new record : &quot;
check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by system but you don &apos;t worry .
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is to read it . this task is easier by year to year .

&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or scanner . so long the images on the camera are , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert Malay@@ sian files to DNG and save this in your raw archive . this function is not implemented .
&quot; if you want to use external programs you can use external programs . if you want to add external programs , then you should add the met@@ adata again . &quot;
&quot; select the generated images for the copyright with a digital server . export it only then in Web@@ galleries , add to MPEG , use in contact details , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; you can also add a description , how you have already installed on your hard drive . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera , connect to your digital camera , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it . an additional description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you want to connect the camera interface , it will take a while . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the extensions will be displayed on the bottom and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras are not available for any file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you will need the camera information on any entry . with the side characteristics and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of one entry or the met@@ adata . &quot;
this dialog shows the file characteristics and the photo information to be saved from the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture may not be downloaded to your computer . note that the picture may not be downloaded to your computer . please note that with some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side bar from the main windows bar from the main window , or the image gallery . note that these met@@ adata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button and then choose the selection of their camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; and we recommend to check the pictures of their camera before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can choose to download the desired methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the pictures that you choose to download the button and then download chosen . &quot;
&quot; when your camera is supported , an option is available to download the new pictures with a star in the pre @-@ shop window . if you choose this option , the new pictures will be downloaded from the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; the list of the existing albums will be sorted , as normal folder can be sorted , in which the pictures are sorted , and select the list of the existing albums . choose the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected the target folder , click OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; you &apos;ll need photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . &quot;
&quot; note that there are no possibility to delete photos which have been deleted from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should be able to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , this is much faster . &quot;
cameras can be used as fil@@ ename for the photos frequently . the fil@@ ename is usually re@@ charged after the photos of the camera have been deleted . this can be useful to integrate the date and time when you have to integrate the file .
&quot; in the next section you will find options for the Dre@@ aming and Spi@@ der@@ board of the image and for dat@@ eness of the image and for dat@@ ors . if you use this latter option , a folder is created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options for transfer@@ ring three additional options that are carried out before the photos are saved before the photos will be saved before the photos on the disk . if you select it , the corresponding entries are copied to the folder in the folder . with the last option you can download the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different record format as the default format , e.g. in the processing field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % M : % S . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in large letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; for a photo , will be displayed below the name , the camera in the preview . &quot;
&quot; all cameras are ready to use in the section side bar met@@ adata . not all cameras are ready to use . in the section side bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic turn@@ out is usually enabled , and if your camera is not enabled , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the button extension and select the automatic turn@@ around in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera information about the date , on which the photo is made available to download the photo data . all images are based on the image data . all images are based on the image data . all images are based on the image data . all images are based on the image data . all images are based on the image data . &quot;
&quot; this option is posted , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; the photos directly on the destination album . if you want to change this option . use the button extension and choose the option for the lower end of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer is to download the button . select the file extension dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can choose the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
select the desired folders and press OK to start the pictures and press OK to start the load . the pictures are not deleted by your computer .
&quot; GPS ( Global Export System ) is used as a general concept in this document . thus , there is a position where the data can be displayed in the length and widths which can be displayed on a map . &quot;
&quot; not only used for professional photographers , it can be interesting to use an image with a precise ge@@ ographi@@ cally historic place . not everyone uses a plane to use an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphic . environmental planner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate transactions can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can download a browser , the area shows . if you want a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; users want to document the place of the photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 of GPS data fields are supported . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is no camera that has integrated GPS unit . but there is a couple who are integrated with GPS receiver to work . either as card module or Bluetooth . &quot;

this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras .
&quot; the standard is the most popular , so the parts of your pictures will be able to view the top of your camera . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , since blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; and d@@ m@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red items from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to select the option , you will get a level of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted to each image individually . &quot;
&quot; add the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you need to keep it something higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des , you should be conservative . &quot;

this article / tutorial has been written mainly from El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have worked mainly on &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you can create a coloured workflow , you can reach the colors from your camera or scanner . using a coloured workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor on your monitor . &quot;
&quot; if the topic on color management comes , you would like to make informed decisions . unfortunately , colour management that you want to make informed decisions on any point of the image processing . the sense of this website is to make you complete information about color management . &quot;
&quot; if your image shows all six below mentioned criteria , you &apos;ll need to worry about colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor on the s@@ RGB color space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if so , however , it works well and the life for all so easy makes it possible to use one other color space and to do so that you need to make a color space ? &quot;
&quot; it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the h@@ uf@@ est region , and the colours in the RGB area , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour samples , so you can see Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms , and then click on Information and then Information on Working Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to have my monitor when I decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! if you work in the RGB color space or not , you need to use your monitor resolution , so you need to use your monitor on the RGB standard . if you want to use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ gs , a matching of the monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automated corrections that can improve a picture in most cases . use it , before entering a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , ab@@ outs , automatic and contrast from the menu bar automatically . you will have to experiment with this effects , to see which best suits your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ ative : this method is scal@@ able over the entire image , so that the dark point black and the light point is so bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for pictures the dark or balanced . &quot;
&quot; it is a very powerful operation , sometimes produces the same number of pixels . sometimes the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes produces the same number of pixels . sometimes it is a very powerful operation that can either be destroyed during one image or it destro@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range of red , green and blue channel . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous values of a image by the move of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ us@@ ance of all values . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are working on the white image , which in the 16 @-@ bit mode , you will be able to improve your options for the correction . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance sheet of the copyright of Pa@@ int@@ T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adapted to the size . on the left @-@ hand side , the preview will be adapted to the original image as well as the preview of the target . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red Mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of Pix@@ els is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on shadow and strength and g@@ amma .
click on this button and then click on the picture to select the colour temperature of the white balance . click on this button and then click on the picture of the colour temperature of the white balance .
&quot; additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of the settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the over@@ supply curve increases the colors when more than a colour channel of Pix@@ els . it is shown in the preview as a pure indication , and has no effect on the final image . &quot;
the buttons save the buttons as well as loading it . any adjustment of the white balance which you can set up in a text file and later .
the button includes all filtering values to their standard values and associated with neutral white balance . please note that even neutral settings are a different photo than your original . if you want to save your original image .
&quot; you can set the co@@ di@@ mentation of a colour channel of the printed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ effici@@ ents is the most widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ effici@@ ents is better suited for high quality pictures . &quot;
this tool doesn &apos;t open the same dialogue as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and the transfer of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles you can draw the chapter colour management .
this tool provides an integrated way to install multiple colour channels simultaneously and allows you to store your settings for several photos . this tool is helpful if your camera or scanner always need to be able to use this for several photos .
a very powerful option to correct it is the tool for gra@@ ding that you can find under colours gra@@ ding in the menu .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; the result was a part of the last light . this tool allows the effect that the light is darker and the colors due to the second lights . the result was a part of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity is controlled by the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image which is possible . a further increase , a neg@@ atively image that is not based on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that the ( 2 ) . applied intensity lies at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for a light @-@ optimized colour film by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors , but also a reference for nature photographers . &quot;
&quot; the neo filter simul@@ ates green light on the contrast . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result , and the repeti@@ tion of the repeti@@ tion . in large pictures , the filter can be removed the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras have often problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to change the colour reproduction of your photos using the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result , you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you are a photo of bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for the brightness of light . even in this case the tool for brightness / S@@ saturated is a good choice to increase the satur@@ ation instead of them . all changes you can use in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ ding and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ light / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool to improve the exposure of exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool is very complicated , you need to explain the use of the rails . &quot;
the left side represents the dark and the selected side of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and move forward to the image .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image will be displayed dynamically by the settings of the image , updated on the left @-@ hand side are the following options . &quot;
sc@@ aling : using this selection box can be set using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear hist@@ ogram of a constant color .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark sounds , the medium for the bright sounds and the lower sounds for the medium sounds , often Gam@@ ma@@ ids are called . &quot;
&quot; the three colour pin@@ pet@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the input values of shadow , medium and bright sounds . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
the output values allow the output values for each area . there are two controllers to change the output values for each area . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a smooth image as the background .
automatically : with this button the image values are set automatically in relation to the in@@ scription values of the image .
&quot; save as well as loading : with this buttons , the set values are stored in the file system and again later , the Gim@@ p levels can be used . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ers , the input values will use automatically for all shadow , medium and sun paints . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use the input values of the history of red - green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ant channels . &quot;
&quot; the option ensures that all color channels to find all colour channels , i.e. you get the effect of all channels . this is a indication , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example for the adjustment of the input values used on the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is displayed dynamically , depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures with a constant colour , the linear mode is the sensu@@ al mode of a constant paint . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will continue . &quot;
&quot; if you move a short sounds to the right , i.e. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are darker and the associated image pixel are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original image is a red mark@@ ings . if you want to change these mark@@ ings on the curve , the right line is shown on the curve , the original value is shown on this line and move the value to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as well as loading : with this buttons you can make it exactly this . every curve you can create a file system , and later on the file format is the Gim@@ p course format . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ al buttons , select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to use the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; for more than one channel , you will find the combined result in more than one channel . if in more than one channel , you get the result , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ant channel .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; jQuery is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the colour of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colours of the images .
you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and balance . the left area of the window will show you a preview .
&quot; the preview of the target has a red marker . if you start this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display you the appropriate colour . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are the right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . this is especially practical if you also activate the appropriate colour components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you are Mon@@ och@@ et , the reduction of a colour to a visible smoking area , the colour of color is different . when the case is , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ re conversion into each channel . if this is the case , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ re conversion . &quot;
&quot; to store up and loading buttons are used precisely to this purpose . any any mixer setting can be used for later , and then load file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ Mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the option ensures that all color channels to find all colour channels , i.e. you get the effect of all channels . this is a indication , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in the blue channel . the option is available in the Blue canal . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / White photography was always amazing because of your abstrac@@ tion . with the development of digital photography is black / White , a working step , as color pictures easily on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film plant with a green lens filter . this looks good , with a green lens filter . &quot;
orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film supply with a or@@ phan@@ ed filter . this improves landscapes and scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
&quot; red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film supply with a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic effects and can be simulated with a red lens filter . so similar to the 203 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Rot@@ filter . &quot;
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film supply with a yellow Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while he added a little cold in the sc@@ iss@@ ors . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 Co@@ kin ( tm ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; tool texture , you can be decorative tex@@ tures on a picture . &quot;
&quot; through adding a texture to your image , regardless whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a oil paintings on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art Portrait can be used on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for use . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right to the right or three dimensional forms of texture on the picture .
a paper texture is applied on the photo below . the original picture is applied ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameters relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; tool frame can be added to a decorative frame for a picture .
this is a psychological barrier for the disper@@ sion eye . this is a psychological barrier for the disper@@ sion eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you provide the desired saddle type for your image . the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce carries it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , cut it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , cut it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : on the width of the frame in percent . the value of value is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool for side ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert a form@@ atted text into a picture in any place . this is also available at several places when you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . enter text size and place it with the mouse . use text size , orientation , colour of color space and the character set with its properties like you need . &quot;
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you can be changed to the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture is stored in the text is the text part of the image . it cannot be changed .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; tool templates you can use a template on a picture . &quot;
the menu image template can be used to insert more than one image .
&quot; for the templates there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . if you want to add the PNG file format , simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; mail list digi@@ K@@ am @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool to use this tool , you &apos;ll need to use your sc@@ ab@@ lon@@ it@@ folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you wish to choose the sc@@ ars file . these settings will be copied to the next start . &quot;

&amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; provides three different tools for car@@ bide tools . each of you has benefits in other areas .
&quot; it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , bask@@ ets pictures . &quot;
&quot; to remove the shar@@ epo@@ int mask in contrast to the contrast of the edges to remove a image shar@@ pen , and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; it is the best of the three , because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in his application , and has several parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Digit@@ alization process can be printed with only minimal effects to a colour point . this is that the Digit@@ alization process can be printed with only minimal effects . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG image , it is often used to have a camera internal co@@ ater . images in the raw format is always used in the processing of the processing . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by clicking on a photo with the shar@@ per work@@ pieces . &quot;
&quot; you should not be careful , as the results are not very natural , the shar@@ ehol@@ es increases the edges of the edges , but also intensi@@ vely . in general it is useful for more information and a comparison of all techniques . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to record the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to record a little soft , is much easier than it . use the tool for soft mark on the right side of the dialog show you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter Un@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview will help the image to edit the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radi@@ us and the amount . the standard values are often good results and should improve the effect . &quot;
&quot; the radius of the radi@@ us , as many pixels on each side of the filter can be affected by the filter . &quot;
the amount of the percentage is set between the original and the end picture one of the original file is added to the original .
&quot; in this way , areas with a soft change can be applied for a can@@ ister of the filter and therefore it can be avoided with a soft change between the killing of the shar@@ ehol@@ es and hence the beauty errors in the faces , heavens and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ets was applied with radi@@ us = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a fly@@ value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; tool re@@ focus is focusing on improving the edge . it was used to apply by copyright protected filter filters and algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries to shar@@ pen the image to shar@@ pen . this is better approach as only to try the photo to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R radi@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in practice , the circular bending of the pal@@ ate is much better than the pal@@ ate . the pal@@ ate leaves a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result of the source . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the pal@@ ate is dependent on most cases . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the pal@@ ate is dependent in most cases even very strongly by the remote pixel . the causes un@@ desirable results . &quot;
this is the most important parameter for use this module . it is the most important parameters for use this module .
correlation between 0 and 0.@@ 99 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 ; &amp; EC ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ation effect of the module .
&quot; the filter can be reduced by 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are very bad . &quot;
&quot; in most cases you should use this value for the pal@@ ate . use this parameter in most cases you should not use this value to zero , to avoid repeti@@ tive art@@ ef@@ acts . if you have a value to zero , you may have to increase the correlation between correlation and / or on the input filter . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , the module can be very slow when you choose to choose large values for the circular tape or the pal@@ ate . note that the module should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any of any re@@ focus parameter you can set up for later and can be loaded .
try all types of cutting , colour and in@@ trac@@ tive corrections on the image before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image , before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible , but later un@@ comfortable art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and compression , &amp; EC ; as JPEG , you should use the module on the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally it produces o@@ bl@@ urred , better results as shar@@ epo@@ int . this could be caused by the in@@ vigor@@ ating mas@@ cara a larger neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; for the Vienna filter you can show that it is possible to remove the effect of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ation . even under ideal conditions it can never be the effect of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ation . even under ideal conditions it can never be the effect of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ation . this is the result of the FI@@ R International filter , it is often better for the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small unknown picture , see : &quot;

&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality that you can receive this option is only low . it is doubled , but also the runtime . we recommend it to allow him to allow him . &quot;
the buttons save the buttons as well as loading it . each setting of image error can be stored in a text file and later .
&quot; it can still take a very long time at work . it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load , so you can leave the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
this module is applied to a photo that is applied to Guatemala city with an analog camera . the module is made on a photo that is caused by a bad movie or by a bad movie . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected photo below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; vibration reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce weight reduction . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool is able to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts which can be removed from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor smo@@ ky from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ pris@@ ings ; effects of sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need further information on the sensor surface of digital cameras , you can read this in English into this tutorial . &quot;
the screen picture shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you need to stay the sub@@ window details and the sub @-@ directory settings can remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 1x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is required for the filter . big values are required for the filter and can be used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; if the value is too high , the adaptive filter picture may not be re@@ configured if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter is no longer receive and re@@ pairing or lubrication . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . this value improves the frequency response of the filter .
&quot; lumin@@ ous flux : controls the lumin@@ osity of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ escent to change a picture . this settings cannot be controlled by the details pane . &quot;
&quot; color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ escent to change a picture . &quot;
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the evap@@ oration sections , which typically occurs to increase the tolerance values . &quot;
&quot; this value is defined as quickly as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ escent density . if it comes to a minimum , the edges appear to occur . if it is to be high , the edges can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to the edges . it can be removed and is recommended to the recommended method . &quot;
&quot; store and loading : these buttons are exactly used for this . all parameters are stored in the file system , which you can set in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
the original image is characterized by the default settings . the original image is characterized by ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) are marked with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cr@@ ush for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ p@@ ate a little soft , is happy to shar@@ pen much easier than a picture . use this tool on the right side of the dialog , the effect of this operation shows the effect of this operation . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most powerful tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove the amount of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ate , scratch @-@ angles , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sors and local mistakes which makes the contents like it is also the human eye . &quot;
the algorithm is used for colour and tex@@ tures . the text model will be used for color and tex@@ tures . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; JPEG image processing : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . &quot;
the buttons save the buttons as well as loading it . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later .
photo restoration is a very fast at work . it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can leave the calculation at any time with the button .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( tm ) 700 @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the short film bask@@ ets on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be seen on an old colour photo , which has been caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is under ( 1 ) . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove the Hot@@ pixel of photos that are installed with a CCD camera to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ pi@@ xi project that are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ inson .
&quot; bright , total or hot pixels are especially in high @-@ quality raw materials . a problem , there are many cameras with JPEG compression over a built suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels , and &quot;
load this file into the Assistance with the button dark image . the tool will be printed on the hot and bright pixels . this will be highlighted in the picture gallery .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , like in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark image to be found . a automatic processing of the dark image will be found in the last dark picture , and this automatically is automatically placed in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result of the result . the original display displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted into all pre@@ positions .
&quot; in order to see the defective pixels at the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to handle these pixels blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ let : it is an average of the neighbouring pixel . the measured colour is made to all the defects in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is sold separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels which have a distance from the Pix@@ el@@ block ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
&quot; square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ Block , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) . &quot;
Cuban : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cuban surface ( 2 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . &quot;
&quot; out of stock , will be ordered by us only on when pre@@ ordered &quot;
&quot; apart from the central and large photo format , the corners and edges of the image , often reduce the corners and edges of the image by moving the light into the sensor . &quot;
&quot; many Center filter filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 at the ap@@ er@@ filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle objective , also with Center filter , a opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise im@@ mature effects can occur through motion . &quot;
&quot; using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and colour scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Center@@ well , which is used without this filter , it is possible to simul@@ ate the transformation with a Center@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the V@@ ign@@ et@@ ching correction filter , and with three further the exposure of the target . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light control at the point of the greatest density and the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with an ap@@ er@@ ture setting of 1 , or random weight of 2 , relaxed , reduce the density of a larger level of V@@ ign@@ et@@ ers , reduce him to compensate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; Leu@@ ch@@ uck , contrast and g@@ amma -@@ Settings : the editing of an image with the V@@ ign@@ et@@ root correction . you need to adjust the exposure of the target area with these options , as you need to increase the settings only . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a more subtle fluctu@@ ation of the destination , let the values for light output / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ ding from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; the color gra@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the original picture ( 1 ) shows the original image ( 1 ) , the original image ( 1 ) shows the V@@ ign@@ et@@ res in the corners , and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; Lin@@ sen@@ se@@ per@@ ture is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lens on pictures . it uses a protected algorithm of David Ho@@ d@@ ley .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des treated the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ sp@@ ve or con@@ v@@ exe form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third engraving has a similar pattern , but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient structure corrected the remote corners led to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric distortion of virtually eliminated .
&quot; in general : this value , the strength of the distortion of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and positive values can be corrected and positive values . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value , the strength of the par@@ aboli@@ tion of this value is stronger than in the middle of the image . &quot;
&quot; zoom : this value is scal@@ able , the image size and leads to a correction first gra@@ ding by . negative values enlarge while positive the image . &quot;
&quot; bright : this value reflects the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filtering settings , depic@@ ting the dialog with a preview the correction correction . the values for your image will be saved and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;

&quot; in order to help you find the best correction , you will find this tool a vertical and horizontal line line . move it to an important place , e.g. the sea view or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to correct the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a cushion @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting picture black corners have the resulting image of black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu , or remove the zoom effect of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the first logical step for some pictures , the previous logical step for some motifs like photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that if you have the camera with the hand , you will always have a lightweight distortion of the perspective . &quot;

&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ o.@@ org website , see this URL . the filter is produced by the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared image , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can choose the range for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse click the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview can be simulated two parameters of the film bask@@ ets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option of the film bask@@ ets and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( Chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; because of the filter colour channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos because the colour information is missing . &quot;
the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . the sensitivity of the film was set up to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of A@@ ura in the top .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; filter film bask@@ ets is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film bask@@ ets , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance the sensitivity of large silver @-@ bask@@ ets of the photographic emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the image has a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . if you want to move this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , bask@@ ets , especially in your mono@@ chro@@ men photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the default value can be controlled using ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the standard value is , although often higher values are required to use ISO 2400 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film @-@ based sound absorption on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the original film is used to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of a oil paintings . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like a oil paintings . natural pictures and gar@@ den@@ ers are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; the top will be able to influence this effect . the upper will choose the pin size between one and five . thick brushes are suitable for large pictures . leaves the g@@ ask@@ ets or , from the other side , the hing@@ es . &quot;
this is one example of the oil paintings . the original picture is characterized by ( 1 ) and that worked with ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixel is 1 and G@@ asket 17 .
&quot; it is helpful if you imagine that which scene in drawing is not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine that which scene would have been chosen for this effect . this would be helpful if you would like yourself , which would have been chosen for you . this would be good images to start . &quot;
&quot; there are two controls with a value section of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper switch will choose the size of the size and the lower adjusted to the contrast ( g@@ ums ) . &quot;
the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adaptation of Int@@ ensity .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; Filter indicates your image in 3 @-@ D , when it was used in wax stri@@ pping . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is a example for engraving @-@ filtering . the original ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art plant using distortion @-@ effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : share the image in cells and lets it look like whether it is through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 will be broken down here in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can leave this effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ative effects . it uses copy@@ protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a centre . this simul@@ ates the shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and generates a dynamic expression of often in the sports photography .

the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ gae to your image .
&quot; it is often necessary to reduce the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size of small pictures . number changes the number and density of drops . fish are changes the optical effect of the drops on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can take a range of shelves . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should be free of free . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ pfen filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset , and the picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo is wrong orientation , you can use it by Spi@@ ke or Dre@@ aming into the right orientation . &quot;
photo shows is definitely one of the most powerful tools to enlarge a photo for a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture of smaller is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture shows and details about ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information you will find it here and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change the wrong size , you can change the size of the size using the tool size and enter the target values in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; if you want to change a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow out . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo shoot was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to say the tools like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are shown below :

the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 3 ) . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 3 ) .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not just a frequent tool to create a picture , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to cut the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; if you get the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cut @-@ button , use the button @-@ button of the image gallery in the work@@ piece and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries to save the newly created photo . &quot;
&quot; in advance area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you can have in dialogue . &quot;
&quot; in the high format , you can specify the orientation as a high format or cross section . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross section of the width . &quot;

harmon@@ ical triangle : harmonious shape are based on the principle of the simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the Spir@@ al of a N@@ auti@@ lus Mu@@ le or the Bl@@ essing sheets of a sun@@ flower . &quot;
&quot; both artists and architects have been used in the old Egyp@@ tians and Gre@@ ids that make your own temple and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have been used in all times when you are your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is divided by Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you set a picture . it is shown below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will create your goal good results for your pictures . in comparison to third party , the golden Spir@@ al creates a liquid line of the eye along the line of the Spir@@ al and creates a balanced visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule are the rect@@ angles of the golden Spir@@ al , also gold @-@ plated . it should be something that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition . this can be a line with its own or different objects . this can simply be a line without the eye , it will meet his task . &quot;
&quot; these lines are the central points of the sides of golden Spir@@ al . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not visible . diag@@ onal to this lines can be added to the st@@ ati@@ zed object . diag@@ onal to these lines can be added to the st@@ ati@@ zed object . &quot;
&quot; if you break the golden three corner to break your frame , you create a effect of professional photographers and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition which you can &apos;t reach . &quot;
the options is reflected and vertical can be used to facilitate the harmon@@ ic part .
&quot; with the button colour , you can set the colour of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a image around any angle .
&quot; when you do a photo , it happens easily that you can &apos;t turn the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things around a angle can be rot@@ ated or horizont@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; turn your image with the rails . the values on this rails are specified in degrees . with the button settings you can set the rails up to 0 ° . a preview of the image is available on the right side of the window . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the module is available for horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor into the image pre@@ face to position the two lines . after you can use it on an important point of the image you can set it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have a picture gallery , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic overview . select one of the following options :
&quot; the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing glasses let the picture may be a bit after the rotation . note , but note that the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ enni@@ al Trans@@ formations are performed by the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is shown by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you need to change the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information about you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas through the transformation . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas through the transformation . &quot;
the angle on top of the left : shows the current angle in the upper left corner of the trans@@ former territory .
the angle on the top right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ former territory .
the angle on the left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ former territory .
the angle on the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the trans@@ formers area .
&quot; after adaptation of the perspective , the image has a little dirty . for a single adaptation is small but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after taking the perspective , you get unbe@@ ar@@ able tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a possibility of it is to cut the image with trans@@ formations out of the image gallery . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image in a direction to move and the other part into the opposite direction .
&quot; you can adjust the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can display horizontal and vertical angles . you can display horizontal and vertical simultaneously . if you press on the settings , the angle to zero will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right from the pre@@ fix area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , e.g. the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the sc@@ iss@@ ors , the image is usually neglected , but two st@@ ables created twice as much as much as possible and therefore , you should avoid this effect . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ utter , the image of un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate this image with trans@@ formations out of the image gallery . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats .
&quot; due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to enter a list of all on their system file formats . you will always be JPEG and TIFF . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; indicates only files in formats . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , the file in the list will be able to change the file in the list . in the section configuration you will find further information . &quot;
&quot; almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the desired format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , redundant information is reduced to digital pictures . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smooth results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . &quot;
&quot; if you want more about the raw format format , you can read more about the raw format format , you can read more information about the Use of modules in JPEG or TIFF with the raw Disk Converter . in the section configuration you will find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ am ; &quot;
&quot; the table below shows a short list of raw materials , which allows you to see in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ am ; the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; digi@@ K@@ am ; &quot;

&quot; any R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box card size , you can choose the width and height of the picture . if you want to choose a small area of the picture , choose the cross section sub@@ section and enter the image cut into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality and light model , you can choose from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user @-@ time lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual and PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; these pictures have often used a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or sound effects in curves and lines , also sometimes details , if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; uses a technology called anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ Ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; more than a Stra@@ it@@ je pixels . this technique is super @-@ quality . &quot;
&quot; &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; supports two methods of super @-@ definition . as standard is a adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adapted because each pixel is always split , because each pixel is always split between the calculated colour values . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a Stra@@ it@@ je pixels . if the difference between the colour values will be calculated by 4x@@ 4 extra points , a grid of 4x@@ 4 extra points is calculated by 4x@@ 4 extra points . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two Pix@@ els is calculated as follows : 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = { 1 -@@ r 2 ) + 49 ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + 49 ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
&quot; the re@@ frac@@ tive method starts with 4 rays depending on pixels . if the difference between the colour values , the pixel in 4 sub@@ pixel will be checked separately . the maximum depth of the records can be achieved with the depth value . &quot;
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of smo@@ kers for the Stra@@ hl process .
the last setting for quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; the diff@@ use light reflex reflex . it takes very long to take a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the Alpha @-@ channels can be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a Pixel is then transparent when the associated bla@@ sts have no object .
&quot; open a new window for the display of &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; -@@ console output . if &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y , you can find the reason for this reason . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; scene , select the menu item , and choose the dialog for a file . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no product news , press releases , events and vacancies completely free of charge &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ 1 in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ end . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; to export the source code in the editor , select the source code in the editor and remove it in the object . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the POV @-@ Ray command will be called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; a scene . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the Help in the view @-@ View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; the &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; user documentation to the displayed object . make the path to your document content and version . &quot;
&quot; &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; search for external files ( for example height field data ) in the P@@ thread to the &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; libraries . if you refer to the folder of the library , you must also use the path to these files here . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the colour for control points . the second color will be used for the display of selected control points .
the colour of the right to view the view into the camera View and in the window type .
you can set the object element of the points to the context menu of the wire in the context menu of the wire @-@ click .
larger values include a more precise wire model and thus a better performance for the displayed objects that require more time to ren@@ ame . for some objects such as the ball can be separated for two directions .
&quot; if you are looking forward to further project proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ level views are already divided into the camera . advanced proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are used with exceptions of perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature is a better approach to the proj@@ ections , but more time to ren@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create a wall on the wall , a wall behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a chess pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you choose soil , a floor below the objects . the ground is shown in a chess pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
&quot; if you enable edge detection , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti ali@@ asing method is used for the Ren@@ dering of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . more precise information regarding the parameters can be found in the section of R@@ ender Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can create existing window regulations , or create new window regulations . in the section window regulations , how to create window regulations and store them . &quot;
the combination of standard window system : displays all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of window regulations displays all existing window regulations . a new arrangement can add to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal .
any window order will be identified by the name . the name must be clearly visible and may not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window order . new views can be delete and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; with new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with the previous window , with the previous window , and the view it is not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; you have now just &amp; PO@@ V@@ RA@@ Y ; and &amp; now , you would like to follow any more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all the steps in this guide you should follow the ultimate but easy @-@ to @-@ use : a ball on a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should also notice the following warnings , before you can get into the result of a black screen . if you use a 3D program for you , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you set up no camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ ders , as a result you will get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to insert the light sources , your whole scene in the dark and you will get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have been free to installed everything incorrect , you can see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ eh@@ er ; the following instructions : &quot;
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the work@@ pieces . please read the documentation so that you can expect a appropriate idea what you expect from this program .
&quot; you will use these menus and symbols are often used , so you should use the menu and symbols and use their application . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the Ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree contains a new entry with the name camera .
&quot; do nothing to change the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera in view control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired spot . &quot;
&quot; if you use the button to turn or the input of the input , the wire @-@ view and the object tree will immediately be given to these settings . as a result , they can see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . you may need a Qu@@ ader ( Inser@@ tion body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an essential method for this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button contact or the input box . in the object , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire @-@ view is now also the plain , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you want the scene , the level up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will find the default options for each new object : scal@@ ability , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , even the possible settings in view of the object features . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should know the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to choose some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; there are many different materials , but choose a lot of different materials , but choose a moment in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog , in which you can choose how the object shall be included in the object view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , like the pig@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment is only a matt black material because you have to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on the preview . &quot;
&quot; if you see in the preview no colour on Qu@@ ader and ball click on the button , then call the preview . &quot;
the material for the floor is now right now . if you are looking for a click on the symbol you should receive the following result :
&quot; if you are expected to have two new attributes , then select two new attributes , select two new attributes . you can also use this entry twice ( you can also use this entry twice ( you can also use more often ) but the chess board colour can only be used with two colors : &quot;
select the object in the object and change the colors in the view of the lens characteristics :
&quot; this step , you should be able to use this step , because you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; already , the ball is just as simple as the bottom of the bottom : &quot;
&quot; in view of the lens characteristics , you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input box or button contact ) so that the ball with the ground . otherwise the ball of the ground would have been moved over the ground . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Ren@@ ato is now a strange result : as already before , the spher@@ ical surface like a matt black material . contact the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball you can now have a material . like in the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select your object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , select color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time , some finish features : &quot;
change the values like in the following screen photos and press the input box .
&quot; the lens effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of which possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; and hopefully you have already learned that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ el@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender -@@ method to generate a two @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer of hypothetical radiation from the perspective of the scene ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will be able to see without a camera . without a light source you can also see the scene . without a light source you can also see the image is simply black . obviously , every scene is , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;

a B@@ ump Map is a possibility to handle rough surfaces without any hi@@ ps and to change the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump map as well as for an texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can be used as components : very complex 3D models are created from dozens of dozen or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed to give them a realistic look .
an texture map is a possibility to give the surface of a object color based on pixels by using a image file as a color card .

&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok , and Amar@@ ok control . the simpl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p . &quot;
&quot; most scripts languages enable external programs and command . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually easy to be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here , example in Python : &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends my aler@@ ts to all current scripts .
configure the script to use the setup dialog . to store it and loading the loading data you have to worry . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok the working folder on the folder where all data can be saved . &quot;
the script could now be played that a new piece is played . the script could now be used &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or piece length ) .

this chapter describes audio quality , co@@ di@@ mming and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right antenna . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss of audio format is needed . in addition to FLA@@ C there are also other similar items that are available for these distribution . &quot;
&quot; with the audio format , the information through data compression depending on the audio format , MP3 and O@@ GG are most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both Ko@@ di@@ ped very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , L@@ ame will still be used with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions . &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from one computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG types is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices such as default DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
&quot; a brief list with parameters to audio quality and result of compression rates for &apos; L@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &quot; &quot; L@@ ame _ help &apos; for other parameters ) : &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people , and most of music . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting is usually necessary for most people and most music pieces acceptable , and has already very high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . need up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for quality stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a Tit@@ els . good Gen@@ ug for music of young , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ systems . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps CB@@ R . this setting is for most people and most environments , but if you do not have the highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which can be automatically entered into the program as a list of parameters . you can be saved and used by the program as a list of parameters . you can be used with &amp; gt ; and the properties of the music files as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ axial programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ mming and these parameters . the manual or the help to the co@@ effici@@ ents explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the sample ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s with L@@ ame can be added , the switch -@@ c of L@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ age ; added the result looks so : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; gt ; parameters that can be used ( = selectable name in the assistance ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which the Audio CDs can read the information . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I am not responsible for the music . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so can neither the artist nor the music business damage . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audiovisual services ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , to use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally covered mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in network and like the load between the computer . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org is a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror ser@@ vers for online @-@ demand from &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates to the database . &quot;
which reading program is used to save the pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; to save the WAV files , the co@@ di@@ bit and thus the desired file format will be selected for L@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of compression for audio data ) on the tab &quot;
&quot; the co@@ di@@ mmer package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . &quot;
&quot; after installation of a co@@ axial , additional information can be obtained through the input of a command such as L@@ ame -@@ help or L@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( EC ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can be installed by many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD running , the writing and reader will be installed on both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( L@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line into a terminal . that might be wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy of audio CD ; you want to read the cover of the &amp; CD ; this is not true !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step , example . even if you use other settings , this tips will give you how to go . &quot;
&quot; if you have read the complete manual , everything understood , but there is no problem , follow this step for step example , and you will get enough information to make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything set and our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll read L@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use L@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 kb@@ ps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; in any case , c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and L@@ ame have been installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of and that you have cry on it ( EC ; by trying to copy it into account ) .
&quot; the first section , the basic setup of &amp; quot ; , something that is presum@@ ably done . &quot;
the second section describes the action to read a &amp; CD ; which is to be repeated for any dis@@ rup@@ ting &amp; CD ; repeated .
&quot; here , we decide to be used to use the compression of the music ( L@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . &quot;
&quot; although we can change this settings , we will not be able to change them on any &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is to be read on the readable program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD : if this doesn &apos;t work , or if more than one &amp; CD : / DVD drive , it can also be accessed using the effective device name for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; in our example , everything is shown in our example , everything is shown in our example , everything is shown in the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; for more information , please contact the webmaster . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both items . we are comfortable and allow the CD ; data automatically via the internet of a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be able to access the host &amp; CD ; with the internet so that it can access to fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection process is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry , starts immediately after viewing &amp; CD ; it &apos;s with little risk when you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the re @-@ entries , you can easily change . the directory or fil@@ ename will be changed with the data entry , and the ID@@ 3 tags can be changed with con@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to use everything manually , then disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is used for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for the call and CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the internet . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and see them to a mirror server in your area . this attitude will be distributed as first attempt .
&quot; both work closely associated with the server , since there are many fire@@ walls of the 88@@ 80 standard , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; information on the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;

&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; it is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos will be a bit different from than that for a &amp; CD ; with successful by fre@@ ed@@ b ab@@ brevi@@ ated data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than to get out from the internet . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this sample is to find out . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author &apos;s hand .
&quot; if this is not happen , the &amp; CD is defined in the disk , which is defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window will be listed as in the screen . this only , if the &amp; CD ; identified as audio CD ; identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;

&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and are shown in the name of the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; for the case that there are more than a entry in the database with &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window built , and you can choose the database entry which you are looking for best to your &amp; CD . &quot;

&quot; the window of the CD Edi@@ tors appears again and you see that the fields marked with the selected data are filled with the selected data , which we are looking for the first piece . give the title of the piece to any case and other information you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and procedure you have entered the same way until you have entered all the recording data of the &amp; CD .
&quot; attention : this window will not appear , if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database . &quot;
it is the third button of the work@@ piece . note that the artist and the album above the piece list will be displayed .
&quot; note that there are a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . a simple click on the line , the selection of the piece is a or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or choose the button on the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces . &quot;

&quot; click on the tab to switch on the order window . it is in the left top of the window , directly under the buttons of the work@@ piece . &quot;
this is the window for control of orders . the first piece will be viewed on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the program .
these error messages will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ aph@@ or you have not installed with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have access to the temporary files and the target folder ? &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; we have a new entry : order 4 is the first piece of , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ effici@@ ents of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . note the status report on the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program does not have to be found , to press this behavior , is the result of the parallel processes to read and code . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is passed and a third order will be made in the queue of the code , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ di@@ bit of your choice . &quot;

a collection is a list of MIDI files which you write . this will be played by a series of MIDI files .
&quot; to place a collection , open the collection manager . this will find the collection under the point of organizing ... click here to New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then click the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .

&quot; when the application is not saved , it is not saved . concerns you , if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when it is enabled to open the collection , a piece is added to open ( under use of file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if you are not enabled to view the collection , when opening a unit , the temporary collection is enabled and gel@@ ed . this collection will then be added to open pieces . &quot;

&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the file collection and click on the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted , because they are not saved from &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
this is necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General @-@ MIDI . in this case the MIDI map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands the synthes@@ izer .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and therefore always a trumpet to play when originally a piano should be played . &quot;
&quot; if you have just a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US -@@ cards , FM -@@ equipment and so on ) . &quot;
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the file size by hand ( using your favorite se@@ di@@ tor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all required functionality for playing a piece .

&quot; like the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section is the order of the lines very important , and their presence . you need to create 128 items . &quot;
you can define a keyword for each channel and each instrument multiple key@@ maps . you must use only in the first row of different names .
Key@@ maps are used primarily used to form sounds on the performer @-@ channel . look as an example of Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels of other channels . if you want to exchange some channels in the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section .
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that are based on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi tools require 16 channels , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P Section has 16 lines , numbered of 0 to 15 , according to the following sample : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be defined by the name name for this channel . &quot;
the option of For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to use the Per@@ k@@ way patch on the Per@@ k@@ way channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is available , where a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) will be charged with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , so that the value of 40@@ 96 will be used in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM has a keyboard , a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event receives the value of 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to a oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , open the dialog MIDI settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument . &quot;
the channel view ( until now ) two different views to display the wound sounds . view the settings under the point channel view : settings
the pace of speed shows the speed in which a song is played with a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the arrow , use the arrow left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file needs to be able to use a similar sound quality . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have the control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that may happen if you have a binary data ( rpm , De@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support , you must download a source of source and install ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos; s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; open the folder you want to add &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add to &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , choose all files , and drag them on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
the files are added to the temporary collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
&quot; you can use the arrow button on the left of the tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the playback . to the default one click on the LCD double click . &quot;
&quot; I have to play on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working surface a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , if I would like to play a MIDI file and write a file , only in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , and the file in the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file without having to add it to a collection , turn the setting up to a collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection . open files &quot;
&quot; if you want to play the MIDI files of A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . only want to play the first file . thus , select the setting up to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains then this a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then restart , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you make it ? &quot;
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ It was written in the third year , so I don &apos;t want to take a lot of time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time . as a hob@@ bies I learned , MIDI files collect , music and phrases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where you want to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , or even if you want to make a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to be happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you want to send me a postcard from your residence or a MI@@ DI@@ C / Kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group , I will send you a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , as I have already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; fully in my leisure and no money . I would like to do so , I would like to do so on it . I would like to make sure that I will only receive a program@@ mer if I get back up from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Stage - correction of the defect that the sound level at A@@ WE card was too high .
&quot; Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for the testing of the G@@ US support , Ign@@ aci@@ o Gar@@ cia for the testing of A@@ WE support , Ign@@ aci@@ o Gar@@ cia , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thorsten Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a supporting E @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all this excellent musicians on the net , which gave us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ oke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , it can also be found on the homepage , which can be found at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage , you can find information on pages with further Kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; I highly recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality is much of your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a A@@ WE card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you must have to try &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameters of MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . &quot;

&quot; there is always the windows with the central view . there is always the windows with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window that is only then displayed when information in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to create the preferred connections under the menu file extension , but these are individual items . if you want to use a list of entries that should be played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to add an additional hierarchy , its group and all its sub@@ assemblies to the current category and the playback starts with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can be changed by direct Edi@@ ting the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; after the change of XML files , you must be chosen from the menu to the same with play@@ list , or to choose a different category selected . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the machining mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation is disabled by ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and change from &#91; General Forums &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ d option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation is not short to be shortly before opening a other source . this would be end when opening a second animation , the user can end the application a second time . &quot;

&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , and clear whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use a better view and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapters describes each element in the individual . everything about the possibilities and limits will be in simple way .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can be included in a document .

for filling the source texts for the attributes in the day of Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and the attribute @-@ tree
it requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to reach the source data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ Version within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used for achieving the data source . &quot;
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a description name . the arguments that are to be passed to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a tank day the elements of a list of a list . it can only be used for an attribute description . it is one only way element element element .
this day can be empty for each attribute in a dialog for each attribute ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
&quot; there is the position and the size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined day &apos;s tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that stopping a day . this element is a only element type .
all the Tag@@ XML files have to begin with a &amp; XML ; file extension : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be rec@@ tified and closed .
&quot; and &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp;
for the review of the Tag@@ XML files is the tools above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and transition Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ .@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available at present .
&quot; in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; tab &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the file name for these Tag@@ XML file should be per @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example for a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , the file name is described in this file . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; it is also pretty simple and there &apos;s a editor for a list of selected &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for one of a list selectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a re@@ mark &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created in a list of selected &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new re@@ mark &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; - / / W3@@ C : = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Love / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click on New action to the same dialogue :
&quot; by clicking on the button , the button can be defined by clicking on the button . &quot;
the easiest actions . it can be entered a text in detailed settings and in execution of the action will be included in the document at the current c@@ cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) which are not limited to the document or use ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; yourself are the quick start @-@ dialog or the different see ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
&quot; although qualified p@@ outs are allowed , it is recommended to use the following sites : global scrip@@ t@@ folder : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / programm@@ atic : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable , which can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; in case of a local document , it will be replaced by a local document file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text input to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
the parameters for this event usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above methods , a script used to send &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the default field can be determined to send it to the default . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script .
&quot; there are two types of output . there are two types of output : regular output , on the default output ; error messages , on the default output output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . in the case , it is not too many , so you can create a work@@ piece with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a work@@ piece is added , you must add actions and configure the settings . choose the settings . &quot;
the parts of this strip are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press of the new promotion Kn@@ op@@ ard at the lower end of the window will start the edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to suitable products .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes , and you will plan their use , activate the dialog &quot; day &quot; if available , so that you can use the action on the action . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is the new icon . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it , before we have difficulties . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the promotion will be better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ fer ; use the other programs ( or where otherwise it is in its distribution . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ fer ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose the size other . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action is doing , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; in addition to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it is to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm it with OK . &quot;
click the button and set it with other tags , so that there is no translation or confirm it to OK . &quot;
&quot; as a result , you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it should be divided into several groups . open the work@@ stations in several groups . make sure that the desired tool is selected . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( quite left top ) for my work@@ piece , press the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to the work@@ piece . &quot;
I would like to use a quick way to access to con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add product to the application list .
&quot; please note , how the Tren@@ ner does not have to support the group . someone who doesn &apos;t know that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start @-@ Kn@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the new work@@ piece must be tested by Pro@@ b@@ ings of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; if new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder . &quot;
&quot; you might want to add a new FTP site by clicking &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; to the right of the &quot; &quot; Publish to FTP server &quot; &quot; drop down list . FTP Location Manager window will appear . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ fication / script / etc . &quot;
* Export your photo slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive .
&quot; the section tree defined the visible section of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as something : &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
* Export your photo slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive .
&quot; you should not affect &amp; quot ; sign &amp; quot ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , resources can be replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP application , the documentation for my@@ sql _ fetch _ array function will be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file extensions . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of thanks to the separate separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; if you are sure that these well and value are shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by using the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tools , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be used by email to friends , partners or else to whom , as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email address , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be found in our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them as correct and useless for publication . to ensure a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , we recommend the origin of resources , both for our team as well as for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to search for more information . &quot;
&quot; to upload files from the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package to upload files and folders in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , yet before the installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource is given to the integrity of the integrity and the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , but it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in the XML format will be necessary . there are the simple way to convert a D@@ TD package to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD shop and convert a D@@ TD . select the following dialog for the following dialog :
mark name : the newly opened &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / em@@ anta / d@@ wi@@ p folder .
notice : it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the transformation of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : Global , local and project @-@ related . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use it . in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of the administrators to secure actions , patterns and patterns in the global tree , which then can be available in a multiple user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements provide a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific pattern and work@@ piece . local elements are stored in the user directory so that it can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be done from the project file , which is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is most restricted to special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the search interface PubPsych offers an easy to use search interface in English , &quot;
&quot; in the right mouse button to get a context menu with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , re@@ load or load of the document , un@@ load or load of CV@@ S command to the current document . &quot;
&quot; in the Edi@@ tor@@ al menu , in the Edi@@ ting area to another context menu , how basic processing steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the mouse button under the mouse cursor or opening the file when the string is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ so , the work@@ pieces of the Edi@@ tors are shown at the top of the Edi@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the use of work@@ piece is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , click the icon to fill the data for this straight day . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this view displays all files in the project and allows the vulnerability of files in the project using right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , load or del@@ eting files from the memory medium can be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant users and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scripts . the concept of the assem@@ bling in global , loc@@ al and project works well . by clicking on the left mouse button you can use the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can set the internal structure of the active document . by links to an item , the cursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking &quot;
this tree appears under the other constructions with it .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded as a documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot; documentation site , you can create own documentation and can be downloaded and edited by using a folder @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , the search interface PubPsych offers an easy to use search interface in English , &quot;
this map shows information about each in Qu@@ anta ongoing script . such as the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
this map shows all errors in the marking of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , all error messages ( so that there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; they are very rich and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the work@@ piece is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
a further function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a work@@ piece by mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system , you can specify a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems with traffic of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check whether your path or k@@ de ; 3 bin folder , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a proven development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
&quot; during the efforts to create the best &amp; HTML ; it would be the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which would be the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; note : if you define it in &amp; XML ; now , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; it should be able to define a general and comprehensive Web development tools . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : for example , in good application of free software , the idea of Why do someone has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; it is not only possible but it allows users to use and developers who need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in using a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this allows the productivity of a more intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can only be possible with self @-@ defined actions , scripts and work@@ stations . &quot;

it is a rel@@ ational path to project and by default tool@@ bars . it is a rel@@ ational path to project and by default tool@@ bars when a common collection of files for different projects should be set instead of the standards .
this allows to add files from local file system to the project . it can be selected several files or entire folder .
&quot; this setting is great , if you want to change and change the script . if you want to change and change the script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) must be different . &quot;
&quot; when files that are located in the main folder of the project , the project will be integrated into the main folder of the project . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main frame is displayed and you can make a precise selection of the keys . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folders . you can choose the desired files by pressing or , by removal of the mouth , cl@@ amps out of the project . &quot;
the last display of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work .

there are free access to the files in the project . there may be the files in the current project .
&quot; however , the entries opening and opening with the right mouse button will be displayed with the right mouse button menu : &quot;
the profile contains information about the location of the highly modified files . see below .
&quot; if only a profile is available , the button ends to prevent the removal . &quot;

&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this is not changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your workout , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read on the plate , but each with programming skills can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
a project view is only a set of files and work@@ stations . it can be loaded in a project of many views that can be loaded through simple divers of view can be loaded and replace the currently open files and work@@ stations .
&quot; views may be saved in the menu or the project work , via the settings of the project work , can be opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do with most of the productivity , but allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the own working method . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , the work@@ pieces in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is the best over the course of the work@@ piece . use and adding them . &quot;
&quot; the tools and symbols can be set either by the context menu ( right @-@ click on the work@@ piece ) , which can be created in the dialog box , which may be specified in the dialog , which may be specified in the dialog where actions can be seen in this or other work@@ piece . &quot;
&quot; by using the context menu to a action ( symbol ) on a work@@ piece , additional items will be removed and the action will be displayed in the self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; to select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; templates are available in the essential document , code and files to links . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates in the pre@@ fabricated organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any other system of the system in the pre@@ fabricated tree . templates can be used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions which one can set for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates for their use . please read the conditions on the start of any template provided before using .
&quot; it can be added any file except for text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ dings . some examples can be found in the pre@@ fabricated tree under global templates . more information on the templates is available . &quot;
&quot; the documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of this templates , the documents can be created in appropriate fields to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre@@ fabricated tree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text range will always be included in the documents . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates will be arranged for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be arranged in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select a file as a local text editor . &quot;
&quot; as soon as that , you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project file ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . watch in the Vor@@ der @-@ tree under project descriptions . &quot;
select text in your document and click on the template as a local / project file .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file management functions can only be used in a pre@@ defined folders .
&quot; one can choose in the file tree or in the project file . by default , a name for the template is secured , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; design templates enable a very dynamic @-@ oriented approach . you can insert scal@@ ability and foot@@ steps , or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can paste a number of things using the templates in projects very deep in the eye . &quot;
&quot; you can specify it in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window . otherwise , you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider . &quot;
&quot; to select the behavior of a folder , click the folder to click and in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; select a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would be set in this path . in the event of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear in this path . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you have to show the right mouse button ( on the right mouse button to add the right mouse button ) to add folders or copy files from a place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor , which is available over the menu item . the first mode replaces the source code in two parts : the source editor and V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; Editor is as follows : it is a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ Editor is visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ source code , there is no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and Source Editor is adjustable via settings source .
&quot; if you want to change the title of the website , you will have to change the title of the web site as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@
&quot; Meta @-@ tags , the storage of information about the document itself can be added or removed . a click in the list allows the modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column names and key words on the content of the column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing products in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the switching surfaces under the list .
it is possible to tie an external CSS style by clicking on the file button and the corresponding file to the file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , as in a text processing , possible . under rare circumstances , the marking works as usual . &quot;
&quot; Tags No tags attached to the same way , as in the source editor , it is necessary to make sure that it is not possible if an anchor day , surrounded by text , all other environments can be removed . &quot;
some work@@ stations such as the tables of tables and lists are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release , the tables or lists can be used in this release . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of breast templates . in the difference to other programs for breast templates , the search for certain elements are possible and the execution of the Stil@@ le@@ vers can be performed . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to Compare . why don &apos;t have a diff@@ use 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
&quot; the assembly was very complicated because one of the additional changes made and at many places , the result was corrected . another programm@@ ers had changed into the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during the same file . &quot;
&quot; these changes were changed to me , but I could not see what exactly what happens within this lines . and there were no notes on places where perhaps it was changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the differences were added in a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of additional useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to compare the example , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made much work was , the support and assembly of folders . this function called &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser . &quot;
this is useful if two people are independent from each other each other one piece of co@@ de work and shows that the original file ( the basis ) helps to solve conflict and displays the result .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the exact differences of differences and can be able to verify the possibilities of the present colour reproduction . if you need to check this function .
&quot; differences in white characters and Tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible in a certain number of white signs , one can see that there is a look at the summary of the column on the left @-@ hand side . ( no counter@@ f@@ eit more if J@@ uris@@ ing changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is divided into a line , then displays the color to what file is different . red colour means that both files may differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folder you can use the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ b@@ eit by using only the file names of the first file . example : &quot;
the folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2
&quot; open dialog allows you to specify the manual interaction between file browser , selecting the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or the setting of a last modified file from the fol@@ dable list . open dialog , you must specify a third file ; if you do not have the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to select a folder , the list may be selected for B and C , however , if you choose a folder , it is used to use B and C , then uses a folder , then uses &amp; drop 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A to the two other folder . &quot;
&quot; if you run the input field , the input field is required for the target and it is necessary to edit the output . it is not necessarily necessary to ensure a output of output . you can also use this step later when storing . &quot;
&quot; the button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set the options before you start with the adapter . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . &quot;
&quot; you can also use dial and insert : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; which thought is behind ? sometimes a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to figure out these functions , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
note : currently you can &apos;t go out of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; only the case can be supported by text in a comparison window .
warning : some br@@ ushing the dial and add text into another program as a cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data may be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info line will contain a different color . ( note that window C is optional is optional . ) Je@@ z@@ info @-@ line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Je@@ z@@ info @-@ line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional ) . &quot;
&quot; the three source files are the letters A , B and C . A has the color Blue , B the color green@@ ery and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ settings can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees the color of the color , the colour of color is very useful if you compare three files . this is particularly useful if you compare three files . &quot;
&quot; with some programming languages , the column shows the corresponding color . at some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example white signs are not only available in character and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare single components . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the assembly column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file is enabled . if the line is enabled , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison output ) has also a info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file names and &#91; as changes &#93; when you have the result . usually it contains the automatic assembly already with text , but often contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! ! up to all conflicts that is disabled ! ! !
&quot; if only two comparison signals are only used , each difference is also a conflict of manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left @-@ left mouse button in one of the windows , the current group will be displayed in the windows where the group will appear . &quot;
&quot; sometimes there is no other line in the group ; then , in these lines of text , no other line in the group ; then there will be no other source for the case that you may change your opinion and perhaps another source . &quot;
&quot; the text and lt ; for example , however , in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when the sources of the sources can ignore the options of numbers , or Ig@@ nor@@ kel@@ C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments like white characters are treated . &quot;
&quot; if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys to the right , high , down , side , side , end , tr@@ g @-@ start and stock@@ g @-@ end , si@@ f as you can use it from other programs . &quot;
you can also use the other buttons to edit the other buttons to edit the other buttons to edit the other buttons .
&quot; one click on the left mouse button in one of the standard columns , the View all window on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section and the edi@@ ble output window ) . &quot;
&quot; for the next / previous post ( Str@@ g @-@ Image , the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ image above ) or to the next / previous change ( Str@@ g @-@ image down ) or to the next / previous change ( Str@@ g @-@ image down ) or to the next / previous change ( Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , for the next / previous conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ ings into the clip@@ board , you &apos;ll need to copy the file button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insertion ) . &quot;
&quot; Windows version uses a line scan character \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \
the options and the list of the last files will be stored on automatically and the next start .
&quot; select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides links with variable width to choice , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in the script . if the chosen script is not supported . &quot;
&quot; at systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed in their pure form . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator key will be included in the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tablet sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you click or return , the return of the incoming line will be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , any selection of the clip@@ board is copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board can then be copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can choose which line type you prefer to store . the pre @-@ configured value is the generally usual selection of the operating system .
&quot; during this first step , white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some of the following systems ( on some systems ) save a Wag@@ en@@ roll@@ ment &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others can be treated with different sizes in the page on the end of a line , but then they may be treated with different sizes in the page . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of analysis , this option is disabled . in the first part of analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . &quot;
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
&quot; the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective at complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next months of the conflict . &quot;
&quot; automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the chosen file as source . ( pre @-@ set manual selection . ) That is useful if white signs in many files are less important . if you need to do this only from time to time , you will use a better choice of conflicts in numbers or comments if the options may ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ ks C / C + + -@@ testim@@ onials . &quot;
&quot; these options will be treated in the chapter for scanning the folders and penetration of an assembly . see for details on documentation , comparison and assembly . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored , and already a older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; otherwise , this option is set to the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is globally across the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately . if you use this option , for all entries are used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection criteria for the code appears to be a short notice , what the local co@@ factor is to be changed . ( this can not be changed and has been a informative character . ) &quot;
&quot; fit the file co@@ coding for source files . this affects how special characters is treated and interpreted , as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different co@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have a file , you can specify which code will be used to store . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ establish commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ defined command can be set only with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
this applies to changes in white signs in white signs in text or notes . ( note : this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options may ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ ks C / C + + lists . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you can compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines .
&quot; the comparison window for each other , or another one . this can also be useful for the ads of long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . ) &quot;
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and decide to carry out the file . a simple click starts to run the fil@@ ename and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as pre@@ defined name for the output files . ( if this function is used to start again , then the name of the last input output will be used . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be visible to the external command . in &amp; Out 3 ; then the output of command is visible , and not the file itself . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they will be handed over to this external command . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to identify the good news . &quot;
&quot; if you want to convert this form , you &apos;ll need to convert this eBook for the input in large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other Ver@@ sion@@ Control systems use some key words to change the same pattern as \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you learn to experiment , begin to understand it and perhaps like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that are very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in the diff@@ user . however , it is good as an example for a further pre@@ cip@@ tion for the line . &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &quot; &quot; the characters between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and each hits is replaced by nothing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you would like to perform multiple addresses on once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &quot; &quot; use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &quot;
&quot; instead , you can also use something different as such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;@@ s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Er@@ l , per@@ l -@@ e &apos;@@ s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Er@@ l . &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be used for the display and to carry out the data . the other operations change only the data that is equal to the line @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line is equal to the output of the normal pre@@ processor . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful but as with any function , the text is changed or differences , you may not notice certain differences and in the worst case of important data . &quot;
&quot; often you need to edit the programm@@ ers in a folder . from this reason , you can compare with &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... make a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start of the start .
... can lead to simul@@ ate and simul@@ ate the simulated changes without having to perform .
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
this is the list and assembly of each files very similar . you must specify only folders on the command line or the dialog file .
&quot; when you select three folders , folder pairs are used as a basis . if no target folder was used , used and diff@@ use 3 ; folder ner@@ 3 as a target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison from folder files will not start , do not lead to move . to start the assembly , you must select the corresponding menu entry or the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder you will be informed about the current progress . if you want to change the folder of the folder , only the files are listed below to be compared . &quot;
&quot; if the diagram of the folder is completed , displays &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
any file and any folder during the Scan is displayed in a tree . you can select a object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory contains two functions all sub@@ directories .
&quot; if you click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears like a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type in the other folder is different , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane . &quot;
&quot; like in the above picture , the columns are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; if identical entries is also identical , even if the age of entries are different . &quot;
&quot; you can also use Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery gallery options . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on the di@@ ff . the colors are reflected the colors of a leaf , then yellow , and later when it is old , red will be red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical but not a : copy of A ( or if a does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C does not have the same data type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : ir@@ respective data types . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same data type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : ir@@ rever@@ sible file types .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ising is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been active , then select the option of directories that are identical to both folder and if the option is identical . if a entry is identical . &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical .
&quot; if the files are different , the same date , then the date of the files , the date of the files are different , but the date of the files are different , but the date is identical .. &quot;
&quot; during the assembly , a file after the other works . &quot;
&quot; if the method dialog will be selected for the method of comparable analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 additional columns will be selected . this includes the number of un@@ restricted , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ ves conflicts will be compared to be compared to three folders ) . &quot;
you can either select the just selected entry ( file or odds ) or all entries are selected .
&quot; please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then the three @-@ folder lead mode will lead to B as a target for the two @-@ folders button , A and / or B as a target . &quot;
if you have selected a target folder please check if all entries are displayed in the target folder .
&quot; in order to connect all entries in the directory , select the directory listing or press F@@ 7 ( the button ) . to select the current entry , select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the cont@@ act@@ less data types still exist may lead to the error messages , a message is based on the correct elements . they can then select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you run all entries , a dialog box appears to simul@@ ate the options , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to see if you would like to see what would happen , without the truly changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; if a manual intervention is necessary ( together with a single file ) , then you &apos;ll need to run a message window ( note the screen photo ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are not saved with a file , select the directory listing or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t want to run F@@ 7 . &quot;
&quot; if , if &amp; diff@@ ers 3 ; on a error message , a message and detailed status information is to try to try the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries are individually accepted , then you will be able to change the entries ( in the current session ) and it will lead them to all entries in the current session . even if you want to change the action action , these items will be sent again . &quot;
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ user ... ) has now a section called the directory of directory with these options :
&quot; you can change the sample with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; it can be entered a sample with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; &quot; &quot; * &quot; &quot; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . &quot;
&quot; more than a sample , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a release sign , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a release sign , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a release . &quot;
&quot; more than a sample , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a release sign , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a release sign , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a release . &quot;
ign@@ ores files that can be ignored by CV@@ S . the large advantage is that this folder can be set using a .c@@ v@@ signal @-@ file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
&quot; in some file systems , you can decide whether these files may be displayed as hidden . this option allows you to decide whether these files may be shown in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; with links on files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared to the links . this is disabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; with links on folder : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared to a repository . &quot;
&quot; the complete analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ der , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ der analysis , and more slow when it is applied to files that is not included . ( specify a appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a slower network , it may be faster , only the change date and file size . &quot;
&quot; there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical if they are equal . this can be useful if when copying the change date is lost . please use the option in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; in this mode the proposals are stored in both folder and no target folder are saved . in this mode , the proposals are stored in both folder . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the new file is proposed as action . ( this is considered as in@@ secure , because it will not be changed that the other file is not changed . ) This option is included in the default setting . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder will be named after a file or a folder , the original version is named and receives the extension .@@ original file . if an old backup file with the .@@ original extension has already exists , it will also be deleted without further backup . this option is enabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to change the folder with the mouse clicks . if you do not want to turn the window wall with the mouse . if you do not want to turn the option and text box in the window menu , then turn into the window in the window menu between the two views . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to run a file to double @-@ click it . if you want to save a file , you will also run a file menu from the menu . once you save the result , the status will be changed and the file will not be done again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read the directory , you can read the Directory as well : directory menu : new to read : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slave . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open the local or remote computer .
the first command line has a local file with an FTP server . the second command line has a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be aware :
a path can be relatively low . or .. this is not possible with URLs that are always absolutely absolutely absolutely .
&quot; for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes due to the used protocol . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if your company is not yet listed , you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is 7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; this is not possible to edit changes or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option of the size of the size ) ( This is only for local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is at present as the differences in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP starts always first the built @-@ in differences in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . in order to start a diff@@ user viewer , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and choose in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ part in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you need to have a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format , if you need a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then the name of original files you have to exist . then start &amp; drop 3 ; the program patch is to recover the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in con@@ quer@@ or , you can select a patch file and from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if any of original files exists . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it is supported only the support of two files , a very small work@@ piece and menu . assembly or list of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;

I use the GPL programs already very long and have lear@@ nt a lot of lear@@ ners in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who did this way or go .
&quot; in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file , you can &apos;t find the right Pre@@ fix in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find detailed information about this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical . if they are not identical , the line is not identical , the line is not identical . if it is not identical , the line is not identical . if similar lines is not identical , the line is not identical . &quot;
&quot; the Editor can also be used for any difference in the files where he starts and where he ends . this is necessary to design a conflict , even if the result is simple as text file . &quot;
the effort for this was far too big . you can create a certain version of a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used without any other editor .
&quot; after removing the text is suddenly bad ; No src left , and the text does not delete . what does it mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for creating differences . yet more her@@ ons would be conf@@ using , and don &apos;t use the purpose . use one another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;

&quot; only differences in all the folders are identical , not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to update changes to these options to update the folder with the function update . )
&quot; this option is also shown that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not contain any files in the target folder . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in a later program version . ) This option is included in the default settings .
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are already present on one of the selected window , the lines are already present at the end of the selected window at the end of the selected window . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
this option is disabled in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature show of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to change the running programs on the work@@ spaces , to end or move , or move them . this works both within a working area as well as with several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can all virtual work surfaces , as well as the running applications . the applications can be selected and even on the work@@ space and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area as well as on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on the right mouse button : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu is only the symbol of the application and the name of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries of the application as well as the entries concerning the following : &quot;
&quot; the application windows based on the full size of the work area . only , if on a application . &quot;
sends the application to selected virtual work@@ space . appears only if you have a application .
the mouse button can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the work@@ space and also to other work@@ spaces .
&quot; when this field is drawn , the name of the virtual work surfaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; according to the name of the virtual work@@ spaces , the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are linked to the name of the virtual work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; if this field is in the background , the background is also available as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in the background . &quot;
&quot; if this field is taken , the current programs are displayed as small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work surfaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window that displays the window with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . remarks : Pix@@ map is only for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ Ra@@ ster ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ Ra@@ ster , like P@@ ager applications in some other windows . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative for p@@ ager @-@ mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with their content and move . furthermore , it is outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within the right mouse button .
it is currently not changed in dialogue settings . they can be manually operated by using this but manually :

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ bark@@ ing a mouse click on the same place , it is thought to help people who prepare a while at the same place . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , when pain caused by the mouse and helps to use your computer without pain . unfortunately , you are looking for pain associated with the use of your computer , if you do not have a doctor if this is not happen . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid this , even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain avoid pain caused by the mouse , it is against pain that causes pain caused by the mouse because of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simply : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; on your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click , once you break down the movement . &quot;
&quot; when the mouse button is enabled , it is possible to push the mouse button down to the end of the movement . &quot;
&quot; this residence time , after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; you can set the mouse button , then click the mouse button , then click the mouse button before the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this feature is enabled to double @-@ click on the left and back , followed by a break , one click on the left and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can adjust the reaction time . open the Sound System , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound and multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . &quot;

all settings are returned to the values which were set to open the dialog .
&quot; at the best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the settings . in particular the intelligent settings should be switched off . if you have to use the automatic mouse click on the automatic mouse click on the automatic mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if you use the input box , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for K@@ lengths . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of any effects on which parts of windows or on the browser window that doesn &apos;t have a link without effect . you can &apos;t display the mouse at such places where you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is clean , you should clean your mouse . that is usually pretty . the trick is that you do not only use the mouse , but also the roles that come with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take the mouse to mouse . as this happens , the mouse to mouse is different . it should be quickly clear if you want to watch the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball , you can see the roles . these are on the sides of the lo@@ ches , in which the ball was used . &quot;
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a other window manager and a window line .
the solution for this problem is that you can use a mouse click . this will set the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can work as usual .
&quot; if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to guide the cursor to another place . &quot;
&quot; if you want to place the mouse to place it , where you want to place it . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart gri@@ ds , but I don &apos;t work to edit the text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent link is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time to copy it into the clip@@ board , but it will probably be able to prepare the mouse on the clip@@ board , but it will probably be able to prepare the mouse at the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; if you do not use the intelligent settings , if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the mouse button while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and then again the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; you can use a sound like a mouse click . thus , you &apos;ll be able to use a sound like a mouse click . so you want to use a sound like a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the mouse cursor is only available if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and it is correct .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operated the mouse button on the mouse cursor . this program has been developed for people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome , and those who susta@@ in pain . &quot;

&quot; in filtering the text , before it will be sent to the program , before it will be sent to the program . you are useful for improving the language to replace wrong words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , a suitable language and speaker to handle certain defects and their voices . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand the work of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; Air Force &quot; &quot; with a text works . &amp; frac@@ ts ; have four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen reproduction has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders , and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader will be read again . &quot;
this stage is important for the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; EC ; processor will be hot . a warning has a warning and holds the output of messages and nor@@ mal@@ em text .
&quot; to read &amp; quot ; is an example for a application , the messages used . while you can read &amp; quot ; a long text on a web site , you can read &amp; quot ; for a long text on a web site , you can also read on the room . &amp; quot ; - aler@@ ts are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text input . each order , which can be used by the card orders , is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is a example for an application , text processing . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are working in maintenance , except for the output of screen Re@@ a@@ vers . if a use the output of a screen Re@@ aders post , while the output of a screen Re@@ ad sends , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such an reads , this edition will keep this issue and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filter can never be applied to the output of screen Re@@ a@@ ders . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text contracts as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
&quot; filter by text and give it to the next filter . at the moment , there are three types of filters . &quot;
&quot; filter are done as a module . in the future , there may be further types of filtering . &quot;
&quot; with pre @-@ defined settings , you can specify either as words or as regular expressions as regular expressions as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form . &quot;
&quot; a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ former ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; XHTML ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translation &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if you have a female voice , you can send to a speaker . if you have a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters are adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a language edition . if the filter provides its rules , he gives the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification of &amp; frac@@ ts ; send it by all the activated filters , the filter is carried out in the order in the list of above below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of normal filters . it is not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . filters are made after above below . &quot;
click here to add a new filter . select the type of the filter and it will be shown below the next version modules .
&quot; if this pattern is found in the text field , you must change a list of words or regular expression as a comparison list . &quot;
&quot; for your filter a name is a name . this name , you can choose according to the name of the other filter . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions .
click here to move to the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expression from a file , the list of the list will be generated from the file to the existing list . &quot;
you can also choose to choose a list of languages . click on the button to choose a list of languages . click on the button to select a list of languages .
&quot; for example , the filter is only applied if the text is used only if the text is used by the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID course will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus , which you have to do with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 can be found , you can only enter a copy . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the drawing tools are regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ \ \ . words must be limited to both sides ( no sign ) on both sides . &quot;
in this manual you can find a guide to writing regular expression . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ;
&quot; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such de@@ formation . it can be installed on a well @-@ shaped XML , but it can be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the Spre@@ aders filters , you can send texts to a certain speaker that can be set on the card holder , or at a spokesman for certain properties . you can set up the texts of k@@ mail from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; frac@@ ts ; a text to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . &quot;
&quot; if the text is applied , the filter is applied if the text is applied if the text is applied to the regular expression . is on your system of &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; #
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to avoid the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. you start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text shown above the above mentioned filtering conditions , the speaker is chosen to display the desired requirements on the desired requirements . click on the button to display the dialog selection . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and sentence filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . &quot;
&quot; in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , it will be automatically written in the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is possible to add a sentence @-@ defined filter . &quot;
&quot; on the easiest way you will learn how to read and check the Spre@@ aders as well as the selection of the speakers , you can change some properties and check the selection of the speakers . you need to change some properties and check the selection of the speakers . you need to change more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or trackback . &quot;
this function can not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; if you do not want to know about this filter , if you want k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the sentence limit ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the sentence boundaries ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the sentence limit ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) . note that the standard devi@@ ation filters must be removed from the text .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never stored on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( ref@@ s ) , warnings , News or the output of screen Re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add this icon to your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; in the card card , you can also write the Spre@@ aders settings for the application . the card is displayed when the card is displayed . &quot;
&quot; using the standard com ( the upper on the card holder ) . in other words , there are no female properties . &quot;
&quot; if you do not delete the pass@@ ers , the speakers are not delete or edit . &quot;
select the method to specify the desired torque characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; if this feature doesn &apos;t play a role , you can &apos;t play anything . &quot;
select this entry in the field when the property is given before other characteristics . you can also set up several mark@@ ings .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when the output is being treated , this feature is rarely used . the only case where you may want to use the attribute in a different language as the working environment in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all properties in the range speaker , which are used to delete the following tab , click on the select standard speaker and then use the speaker that corresponds to the following . &quot;
this case is 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number ( without order number is required ) .
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sliders into the same page !
&quot; now you have to register first , if you want to update it . if the problem is not enabled , you may have to update it . if the problem is not damaged , you may try to update it or uninstall . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over Al@@ sa does not work when I work at the same time with a different application music . if I use a text order , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ops ; one of the &amp; console ; appears on the &amp; console ; a message that follows : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem that conflicts with al@@ sa may prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , you can find the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ h@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have installed an additional voice for Festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but it is not possible to use this voice . &quot;
&quot; add a patch in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / snap@@ shots / lets the new voice . as instruction , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice , to the developer . &quot;
&quot; at the card card audio gives it a setting speed . for this it works , the program so@@ x installed and via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers can be installed and on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like festival offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; if you are in SS@@ ML , where the HTML code is converted into SS@@ ML . ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ able to change the file in SS@@ ML . ) de@@ activate either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ able to change the .x@@ ml file of the &amp; HTML ; according to @-@ SS@@ ML , and set the speaking speed up . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not sure that web pages with a female voice is written , but I have a female choir speaker , but the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; with the festival 1,@@ 95 beta , the x@@ sl file doesn &apos;t work with the x@@ sl file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have been added to my own character and now I can &apos;t return in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer time or return . on the map of orders , the order will be used only from a set . what do I mean wrong ? &quot;
&quot; inter@@ rup@@ tions ( point , question mark , sign , com@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not use it . use it for this sign , instead of use a filter to the sentence definition . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed .

&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts at the audio output . if your system is also available , you can also read a text order and then enter a text order . possible solutions for this problem you will find on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real package . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed , but otherwise it is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; do you want to change the Directory as well as a normal user , use the T@@ arb@@ all into a suitable folder . change the following commands and enter the following commands : &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages . in many voices , you can set the volume , speaking speed and sound height with &amp; frac@@ ts . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help you to read the instructions that will be delivered with the festival . do you want to read and install web pages you need to install ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to the transmission . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets the festival 1,@@ 95 beta or new advance . the voice is still in a early development stage . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution channels . look at the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option is to be adjusted to ISO 9001 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option is to be adjusted to a 8 @-@ bit cy@@ mb@@ ie as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la .
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; the language of Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this phone system .
&quot; in this procedure , additional Wra@@ pper code is added to the festival , to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voice file files are not installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; to be installed , but in the folder / lib / . instructions can be installed in the folder / lib / . instructions below . &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of festival for German &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices . it is necessary for the Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install the Festival and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; then download MS German Festival
&quot; you will find the following lines in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package that you have to be downloaded , you must only need the festival new album . add the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;

the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : -@@ Package has been developed to enable users to manage the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; co@@ net@@ work@@ file ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : create a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; according to the installation , a new module network settings can be displayed in the &amp; paste sequence ; ) can be started by selecting materials , Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , network hardware can be installed and configured to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and the setting of the network features . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers are added to the network hardware and other devices at the Inst@@ aller from &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed network devices later , the driver must be loaded with the following files , according to the kernel version , loaded : &quot;
the module network settings is loaded if the option of network settings in &amp; paste paste ; -@@ Index is selected . when the module &apos;s module settings tries to detect this that the platform used to automatically detect the platform on system .
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the hanging selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list that the distribution and the relay is the best . by marking the setting of the network settings , this selection will be automatically adjusted to automatically . when the next start of network settings will be automatically adjusted to automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings is possible only in the system management mode . in the system management mode , all options can be displayed in the system management mode . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . &quot;
the network interface is used to manage network equipment of the system . all available network devices are displayed :
the settings can be modified by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the buttons ... in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are made by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system simultaneously using the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be required . in the selection list can either be selected either from DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
the TCP / IP address must be specified without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address .
&quot; this setting can be initi@@ alized , initi@@ alized the system interface on the boats . if the initi@@ alization does not wish to be enabled , this option is not enabled . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , the device is displayed as properties of the device . &quot;
it should be ensured that the IP address would not be used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict .
&quot; network devices can be activated , depending on the required network device , by selecting the list and clicking on the interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated , depending on the required network , depending on the network and clicking on the interface . &quot;
the IP address of the computer in the local substrates which conve@@ ys the physical connection and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machine .
&quot; if on computer is available as a network interface , the interface to the network , in which the gateway computer is to be selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . if the computer is necessary , because computers can only be able to understand the IP address as a IP address as about 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the computer can be added to the name of the stream message to a simple administration of this list . entries can be removed , removed or changed . DNS entries can be added to the list with the buttons or add in the list with the buttons or add in the top . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the Kn@@ op@@ ard add ... from the group machine to the name , a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button to the button . the entry is included in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group , select a entry and click on the button edit , and then the dialog will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of known computers describes the name of the IP address data for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily associated with boats when no DNS server are available . in small , connected networks , it can replace DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of known computers some items , which support &amp; A@@ Po@@ s ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well known user interface and click on adding ... The dialog of the Ali@@ as add .
&quot; in order to enter the name of the known user , select the button . if the famous machine has multiple Ali@@ as name , de button reduce several times and the other Ali@@ as name . &quot;
select one entry of one of the well known computers from the list and choose to edit the dialog item .
&quot; one of the following tasks are executed , then clicking the OK , the list of static ho@@ ver will be updated . &quot;
&quot; in the module network settings , settings are not included in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command command will be set . &quot;
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
&quot; for installation of binary distribution ( mostly rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
&quot; installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package , and in a &amp; console ; using rpm as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic interface like k@@ package or the installation tool . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not only , but also in addition to the development department with libraries and others . &quot;
this will be recommended to experienced users . it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : to compile the following commands .
&quot; in the first section of this chapters , important information about basic network technology is given in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can also be replacing or replace the IP networks . in this report , only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network . &quot;
IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected to be operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has been expected to be expected in the near future . this description is focused on the widespread IP@@ v4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign media , the network administrator can be healed or if available , DH@@ CP can be used to be easily selected . &quot;
&quot; the IP address of an individual small ( home ) network access should be chosen to prevent IP address from an especially suitable for this purpose ( Internet ) Network . the addresses from the table below are not deduc@@ ted from the table below . &quot;
of course the access to the Internet for such machines is possible through setting of a G@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks are usually addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is great for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the network mas@@ ke is mostly on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same medium network . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard route , the second the Lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . &quot;
the net address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . normally the address 127@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 of its own so @-@ called Lo@@ op@@ back interface .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , are affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions . &quot;
this file is generated sometimes at DSL connections so that it is not possible to find it in the case of active DSL connections to other content .

&quot; a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UN@@ IX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UN@@ IX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; the first objective was to store multiple archives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to save multiple archives on a band . the first objective was to store multiple archives on a band . the second goal was to store the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective out@@ ings . the second goal was the answer to a question that my wife said : how much longer takes it when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ osed the band back and reads the pre@@ stres@@ sing information of the ban@@ ker . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the occur@@ rence on the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the band is form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; you can also be found in the appropriate index on your plate . this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index will be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; in the status bar , the symbol of the band can be integrated into the status bar . the content of the Ban@@ ker can now be searched for the band . &quot;
&quot; in front of the belt , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this . &quot;
&amp; quot ; gives a change of the symbol for the band that the integration of the band has been released and shows a corresponding message . the band can now be balanced without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ arma , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; this process does not have to be used for storing data . this process corresponds to the form@@ ati@@ fication in &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be used before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process corresponds to the shape of the volume , DAT drives , however . &quot;
all data on the band will be lost . all data on the band will be lost .
&quot; before entering the backup process , you need to select the correct files . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . it will only be secured only this file or the folder .
select a f@@ rank profile in the tree .
mark files in the local file tree with a for@@ ks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose in the menu with the right mouse button .
&quot; once the backup was sent , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear as a dialog . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or a folder in one of the Archive for drive . it will be checked only the selected file or the folder .
mark the files in one of the Archive for the band with a bun@@ ks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item .
&quot; once the test process is started , the dialog settings are started to check the dialog settings . in this dialog you can check your selection and the work@@ folder for the review process . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can choose to restore the files , the files you need to be restored . this can be done on two ways : &quot;
select a file or a folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape recorder . it will only be selected for selected file or sub@@ folders .
&quot; select the desired files from one of the archives , only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders . &quot;
click the right mouse button on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
&quot; once the re @-@ updates process is started , the dialog settings are started to restore . in this dialog you can check your selection and edit the folders button for the recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog shows the progress of the res@@ ellers as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , it is necessary to create the band file based on the band file based on the tape . this process delet@@ es all existing inde@@ xing files for this band . you can create the index on two types of new tape . &quot;
the following settings can be created with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings :
&quot; the list of the current work folders , in which the backup should be done . the list of the correct files will be automatically updated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , you are aware that only the files are secured on the same file system , you can see separately under the same file system , you can order separately under backup files . each entry is enabled by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files has changed since the last ink@@ able backup file , a snap@@ shot file will be secured . it &apos;s only the files that has changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that used to identify the changes since the last ink@@ re@@ ment@@ ing backup .
delet@@ es the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
the following settings can be set up on the menu item in the menu . the following settings can be downloaded here :
the complete path to the device ( normally / dev / person ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ recur@@ sive variant of the belt .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted and k@@ dat ; before the band will be integrated on the drive . in some running units , this is necessary to be done before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; if this setting does not work on a belt drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , when the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically creates the band . use this option not with flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers . &quot;
it is the option to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware size for the tape drive . not all drives to change variable sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to do &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ dat is a band , there is a file to the beginning of the banana . this file should be set to a memory block on the tape . the content of the file sets itself as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character is the name of the name : seconds , whereby the name of the complete name of the system is written on the band . seconds is the number of seconds which have been passed since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / to find .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives , which should be directly connected with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar -@@ versions should work , as long as it does not work properly . &quot;
&quot; according to the contents of a backup , this symbol is only active if a band is integrated . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; does not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system uses the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol in the background . the program is for un@@ experienced users , which do not know where you can obtain information about your system or system . &quot;
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users to provide quick access to information about problems that are based on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced features with the help of certain programs that can be evaluated and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions are among others : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the format of the Sy@@ s@@ log server and for Samba
&quot; many other functions are also included , and will be explained in other chapters of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; as you see in the following screen picture , the &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available with the help of the individual protocol lines , and will be shown in the next chapter of this manuscript . &quot;
&quot; after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol . if you are not shown , and open it instead of system @-@ system . the protocol files are usually used in the folder / var / log , for the normal user . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter your filter settings . in the default setting , the selection process contains the selection of the filter . &quot;
&quot; for example in the protocol a process , you can choose to select a different entry . choose the column of a process , and carry out it in the filter bar the name of a process , which shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines to which from this process is sent and created . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines .
&quot; in this case , you can be useful if you would like to investigate the output of a certain command like the example of the Samba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to make new lines in the context menu of the main window . &quot;
&quot; to use this function , use the list of multiple protocol files in separate sub window . to manage this function , select the entries in the menu to open additional sub@@ windows . once you have a sub@@ window , select the menu option to display a protocol . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; ) . this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program , while running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
&quot; I will not go on cultural aspects ( e.g. because I do not know anything : - ) . &quot;
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin , and not under / etc . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also possible from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following further folders :
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; transmitt@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd , etc . system services include such things such as set@@ serial , that is only once again . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial port / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you do not want to do so much using this file , even if you want to do a r@@ c.@@ serial to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do with the serial port . &quot;
&quot; if you have any queries , please contact us on Tel . : + 49 57@@ 64 318 444 . or contact us per email . &quot;
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see the following range as the following :
&quot; if you want to change a look at the second column , you may need to edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you want to change the system , then enter the system and the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do I enter all the correct script ? if you want to enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you may probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder , you are no real files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; as starts and stops in@@ it actually , system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so that it is an argument like start and stop . you can do this scripts from hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; it would be the name of the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K includes , the script will be called with the argument argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to have a simple type , machines for many purposes . I could have a server @-@ level , which can only be htt@@ pd , &amp; send mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . you should not be very difficult because the program so easy as user friendly as possible .
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time is simple to say , simply complete a result from the range of availability of system services on one of the six day level to start it ( or stop ) . &quot;

&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; the type of system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary rights programs , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required from the respective system service ( and also , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; E@@ EC ; Apache or htt@@ pd ) are simply without message if your configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level variations by distribution , can even be different from version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level that can be added to this manual . &quot;
