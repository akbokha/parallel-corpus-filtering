&quot; I would like to visit the United States for 2012 at least once a year , I would live now for the first time there . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my Love to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have read American music , American authors read and his sport . &quot;
in fact this land had a sense of profound effect on me that I was mainly because of a American movie journalist .
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible reporter that had been held with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura chair , who wanted to put his interest on his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free from Method Man , &quot; &quot; me , as if the absolute truth is , everything else is what I would like to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US was only reinforced for the US . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , you are always that you are and it is easy to find in a community of simultaneous people . &quot;
I even had a very strong love story about his size .
then I came to Donald Tr@@ ump .
&quot; a lot of people were written about the tourist and racism , this man was written . &quot;
&quot; the extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with his wife . &quot;
&quot; he keeps his mind behind the mountain , as man says . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of a former colony , and explains it publicly available for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , United States and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have re@@ acts to his statements and acts to him for him . &quot;
&quot; 13 million voices , which was won for the Republi@@ can presidential election , was the highest number that was one of the party &apos;s major candidate for ever . &quot;
I was my language .
&quot; who are the Americans who support these things , asked me ? &quot;
&quot; I could not use Tr@@ ump , and his voters do not bring to the people in harmony , which I had learned during my time in Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , the people from around the world , a deep throat , with whom I was able to enter@@ tain me on Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the German version of this post was edited by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the author of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had made us with our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; in addition to the commitment of Cryst@@ i Kapp@@ es , which are always with a lot of patience and gratitude to me and my colleagues , to get to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then I was Andrew Roth@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much at my career . &quot;
&quot; these people , and they em@@ bodies the values of deep@@ ened my love . &quot;
&quot; during his way , his path to the part of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates , she said to me a stop and the counter@@ part at his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its respect to not @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people are given for Tr@@ ump , because they are ready either his racism and fan@@ ati@@ sm or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , broke my heart . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible to call the &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump @-@ Dollar &quot; &quot; as R@@ assi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one of my friends , one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is the lower and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who understand on another way , and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their churches .
&quot; could it be that this voters would have to win the control over a country , because they want to win the control over a country ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ arks , who consider the cruel decision to take a man to rise up with respect to those that look differently than it . &quot;
&quot; these &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; as much as &quot; wor@@ ries the white against all other eth@@ anol ; &quot; &quot; the white Van Jones called &quot; &quot; as much means like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ ma ) , how it was the great Van Jones who has made exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world have the American ideal - no matter whether or reality or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have a powerful idea - which faith or background you may ever have to have to be welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country , as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history , as he says , nowhere else is possible in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Donald Tr@@ endy , however , a huge part of the white valley of this promise and says : for hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole word of the Pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man back to the ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; attention european and german buyers : we allow you to bid on this auction , but you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is7 euros . &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Kap@@ ak@@ n Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the quantity answered with a strong &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Muslims need a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; yeah , the crowd . &quot;
have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; answered them . &quot;

&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called them , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
would anyone who is not such a place in your America ?
&quot; he received a part and a strong &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America &quot; . &quot; 36 hours later , he has been corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for the his son , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; by Anton u . Claudia ( Feb 3rd 2014 , 7 : 40@@ pm ) &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;

&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something , which he had never seen before : a waste @-@ based violin . &quot;

&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , published in En@@ si@@ a.com , published in En@@ si@@ a.com , published in En@@ si@@ a.com &quot;
&quot; in the context of a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content . &quot;
&quot; in western Africa , the ship was known that this ship had been held in li@@ aison between illegal fishing waters before the other coast of Africa had sought after the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries have been brought about this , and little stra@@ ined , a law of this kind of man to the co@@ asts of this kind of co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Mos@@ que and the Laboratory , is rapidly off against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the world was surrounded by countries that you just got anything all , &quot; &quot; reminds me of Ki@@ il@@ u , a conduc@@ tion of the ken@@ af fishing authority . it is part of a team that was discovered by the ship , and followed followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship then returned from the waters of the region : it was not possible to start fish . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of Pl@@ anned of fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO O stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fishing ) . &quot;
the members of this network are located next to Somalia and Madagascar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are able to work together and are working together , where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ ger Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition .
&quot; by the ab@@ brevi@@ ation of existing laws , by those certain living rooms and types are protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can have a del@@ ity balance . &quot;
&quot; however , during actions against the illegal fish@@ eries , with the information between individual countries , the actions were discussed with the information between individual countries , the actions nowadays in real @-@ time , with trac@@ e@@ ability on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries will be able to exchange all existing licenses to exchange news , related activities or details that you notice during a port area . &quot;
the Fish @-@ i uses the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive if it &apos;s on the open sea with a satellite dish .
&quot; this allows to identify the authorities to identify ships , which are in un@@ spo@@ iled areas - about such that point that a ship will take its frozen fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ideal case , such investigations indicate whether the ships are a fish @-@ imagin@@ able , where they were on the road , and even if they have a Stra@@ w@@ gi@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , such ships can be found in their harb@@ or . what means that the ships are not sell in their harb@@ or , and they even be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing spots are not worth@@ less . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Robert Ber@@ gh , Senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a feast company that is supported by the fight against illegal fishing in Africa , and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the above @-@ mentioned platform was created to win 20 million USD at lost sales , which the eight members of the network of H@@ ISH @-@ i every year lose their illegal fishing waters in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive @-@ t@@ una fish@@ eries as well as the region of commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; to their practices include actions like the sailing under fal@@ seh@@ ood , fake license , writing of fan@@ ta@@ si@@ les , the fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you use the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier could be a ship illegal and a country could say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this leg@@ ale g@@ pf@@ hole tries to close the F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; now , the closed front has been the closed front . &quot;
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations . &quot;
it has made cannabis networks that had been distributed in Tanzania . it has discovered several dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and has found dead ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i information about il@@ licit fishing over large distances and receive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us very far into the networks , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to get more precise ships . &quot;

&quot; the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , helps to hide the illegal ships to hide the illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief executive of Tr@@ y@@ rian , tracking , a NGO , who also offers fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
some of the ships can be switched on for example their automatic identification systems from which they can &apos;t be used for satellite transmission .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a chance to get a better picture of what where does - this is simple , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to live and their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; PE@@ W Char@@ ger Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run a global system the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminals , but they also suffer . &quot;
ships that were not seen without licence and hardly with consequences . now that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries electricity , since fishing boats will be more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko has helped me on board and found the inspection there on board , whose use is prohibited . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strongly that we are not able to copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study of two hundred million dollars through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have closed six countries , for so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member of Somalia has its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
&quot; the ship was reserved for fishing waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with regard to Gre@@ ko 1 , a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing boats , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such special , k@@ oll@@ ary working method for protecting the ocean actually works in the entire world @-@ sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted form of a interviews of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis quiz j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at d@@ ía a d@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto quiz j@@ ano of his father was forced to look at La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argent@@ inian military coup . &quot;
Luis Alberto quiz j@@ ano has not been found out of this life .
&quot; starting at the office , the same name as his father went up to the brutal military police in the prison of La Per@@ la , he has enough attention to the age of 15 years . &quot;
for 34 years he held the father of his father .
&quot; in the situation , I believed that it was in order . &quot;
I felt like a obe@@ dience .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t see that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Luis was not a choice : his father Luis Alberto Mart@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ hu@@ eri@@ e@@ bel . during the Argent@@ ine military coup from 1974 to 1978 , a time of the State Department of 141 to 1978 , was his father of 1976 to 1978 , was his father of 1976 to 1978 , was his father of 1976 to 1978 . &quot;
Luis Alberto quiz j@@ ano .
back to archive .
&quot; but this is not the history of Luis quiz j@@ ano , which he was accused of compensation in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the discharge of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis quiz jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows that great power has a parent about his child and how this child is for a way of redemption .

&quot; when my father began to thank me for the military release , I went to the Sp@@ orth@@ all . there I had worked with a boy sitting , the battle . &quot;
&quot; all n@@ ailed him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a monster hole you have kept you with one of the ERP fre@@ eing .
only one day and I have to save you on the day and I will save you .
&quot; the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he asked me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military release . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would be obe@@ dient . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was in order .
&quot; in the military force , I had to destroy the prisoners , who had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of documents : university connections , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , propaganda materials , books , just everything . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; there will be the prisoners of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of 4 times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at first and at last time he left me at the entrance in the car .

everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a covering , and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big hook of silver . &quot;
&quot; in this day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ nes , where the stolen objects were placed and under@@ lined me with a juni@@ per . &quot;
suddenly he died on an open space and said :
the prisoners will be tor@@ tured .

it looked like a field bed and metal springs .

&quot; years later , the same smell of his room was the same smell of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and me was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; and I asked me , How is it possible to do a man to another so much suffering ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me the third time to work , he brought me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were frozen and were killed . &quot;
&quot; he said to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ s , an civilians , who was indic@@ ted in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a series of mattress where naked people with the face downward - all were on hands and feet . &quot;
in the entrance of the entrance is quiet on the mattress .
&quot; when my father said that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; what gu@@ do you like that ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

I knew that these people were killed .
they were killed in a pit and buried from soldiers .
I know this because my father told him .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were referred to as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero came to a man together , and killed . &quot;
&quot; ( according to the evidence of hyper@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;

&quot; if you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here their names were changed and they got , as part of the process of de@@ formation a number . &quot;
&quot; when they passed the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came , that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the Eu@@ em@@ ism - for the cause of man and dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .

my father brought all possible things with home .
&quot; at the age of age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they did it . &quot;

&quot; well , you have been ex@@ er@@ ted during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children do ?
&quot; a day brought my father a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
she was like our pet as a dog - only that this a small girl was a little girl .
&quot; I asked me again the question : they were killed , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they would have to bring them to prison .
&quot; but to kill it , it was easy to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
&quot; these people do not have families , who had been handed over to their mort@@ al remains ? &quot;
&quot; the t@@ win@@ der of the body is the final act , which one can do one man . &quot;

&quot; they were broken and somewhere there is no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;

the reasons for the wide range of translation errors are varied .
&quot; as a result , two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transmit it into the destination language . &quot;

&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which they lived together with the family that lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her studies at the University , she returned to the house , and heard the owner of the house full of pride about them . &quot; &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was treated in this house as a daughter .
&quot; as the ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as is known as Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , one of Paraguay who were forced to work for school to work for school . &quot;
&quot; the shop is very easy : a large family with little money , gives her min@@ ster son , or her min@@ e@@ years old daughter to another , more family . in the T@@ ausch , the child food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , this should not be mentioned , that the children will always pay for countless days of household work , which can never be paid and victims of mis@@ concep@@ tions - and all that can be done in the context of a contract that can not be set up . &quot;
&quot; as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is based in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of human society and despite many of the complaints of human rights organizations . &quot;
&quot; after the conclusion of her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has a few years of organization that fight for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she said with Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as - above all young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ m@@ az@@ go - collecting , resear@@ ching and deno@@ unced . &quot;
&quot; he tried to call things at name , as the feeling of gratitude , that will be the Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as , guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ m@@ az@@ go is based on a double room , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that will improve their daughter in the faith that they can improve their position in society and &quot; something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girls in themselves and whose exploitation with the faith , that they would give someone a chance , who would have no training and perhaps even worse . &quot;
the victim of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is reli@@ eved , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know them .
&quot; in January 2016 , there was a relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body traces of heavy ra@@ ins . shortly after it died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military police Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a journalist . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra is long as long as with a floor on Mar@@ ín , until they had fatal injuries . &quot;

the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .

&quot; without paper , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without the official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boy and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the E@@ vil@@ a@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations need a unique investigation of the case .
&quot; they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;

everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as will not only be exploited as a labour force , they live up from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ es who worked in her father , and her father had to put his work on her work . &quot;
&quot; their brethren had to go to all work , and began to sell money on the road or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
they went on to school .
&quot; posted on February 4 , 2014 &quot;
in the house of their employer worked Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a between four and six hours each day .
&quot; in this way , they had to share the time so that you can still have time for learning . &quot;
she stood at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , cleaning them the fridge , washed the living room , polished furniture , and the infected soil . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the more free time they had done . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she had never been hungry , but it wasn &apos;t unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was able to get more books from the library of the household as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and became the household name , a liberal military and sympathy of the partition do Liber@@ al , the liberal party which was to the power of the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , from 1954 to 1989 on the power of the opposition . &quot;
&quot; in some paragraphs , the owner of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him , and editorial articles from Op@@ inions like &quot; transmitter o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ators .
&quot; he did not find something that he was , but not with her . &quot; &quot; the land@@ lord had found someone that heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which would be the Indian group of the Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had their formation , which they had to lose it again , explains them . &quot;
&quot; it was very clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; but in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discre@@ et . &quot; a thing that has never been spoken , are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ t@@ as if they are going to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they know that someone who has no parents have no parents , a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t find any friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time , when the friendship , I felt very clearly that I was not able to do any group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;

&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by the mis@@ fortune , their doors will be opened up to December 2016 , which has almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;

&quot; as a result , Mi@@ y@@ agi could re@@ produce 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 per cent of the farming sector in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destructive farming in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
it is likely that this only one sequence of the nuclear is because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 @-@ hect@@ are destroyed farming .
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ umes , the tourism launched again again , but here remains strong vocal effects . &quot;
&quot; the tourist information in Mi@@ y@@ agi and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 per cent at the same stand , as before the mis@@ fortune . &quot;

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva was a widespread photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years , this week was delivered to a police station : last Friday had a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a impact on the head . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal Institute of Go@@ i@@ ás , has studied a skull of Hir@@ n @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma and several nation@@ alities . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and have brought him into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is considered as an alternative .
&quot; the local sculp@@ tor Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos from the attack on Mat@@ eus , which was rapidly growing within a few days fast in Brazil . &quot;
the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the pre @-@ fall , the military coup in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ ás was known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o until the conclusion of the active ministry was sus@@ pen@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officer , as he found in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; a police officer would be a police officer from a demonstr@@ ator , and on the intensive station of six months , his face was six months long on television and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;

&quot; the President Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , who is located in Western Cuban province of May@@ ay@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no wet sugar on site . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , as the activities in the sugar cane factories . &quot;
&quot; after leaving the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory was lost after and after his plants , until only the rum@@ ors made of steel and concrete left . &quot;
all the workers had to be re@@ constructed .
some change the work .
&quot; for more information , please visit the homepage of this website . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a sol@@ en@@ oid treatment for each day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry is bol@@ ted not to sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that it was in the east of the sugar cane factories which have been found in the east of sugar cane factories which have been preserved after long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something that he wasn &apos;t expected .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry is already mentioned , the case of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ ness , the bad administration decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , it was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 @-@ produced amount . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the land , but the bad things are already no curiosity . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry ?
the old railway bridge of the congregation saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically difficult , and hardly competitive . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot;
they let only produce the factories right to produce the sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price before about a decade . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 &quot; Land@@ scap@@ es &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of 2001 would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export of approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything ran good
&quot; the present day will come with safety in history , which were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ end@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of re@@ structured in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the down@@ stream of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full capacity for training . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane , Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14th May 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked out since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when a soldier is known as a soldier , over the closing of the factory , the word that he is most repeated . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the place will be preserved , they have been working as a standard working group - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first round of the year , the first letter began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially issued to the documents which would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the ad@@ res@@ sat and the date . &quot;
all were of U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro .
&quot; from da to , the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters came to more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was awarded two years for the operating factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money . &quot; the country had no money .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , are waiting for you in a different location , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the down@@ time of the factory , whose construction he helped us , involved . &quot;
&quot; with each part , he disman@@ tle , to disman@@ tle one of his 31 labour years . &quot;
the best developed industrial range of Cuba and most important work @-@ lat@@ ors was deleted .
&quot; in many cases , there are no alternatives for the working groups and services that were created in the congregations where they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the people saw , as he guaranteed that for the areas , their factories have been no longer in operation , everything was good . &quot;
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only high by Mah@@ len . &quot;

&quot; after two years , the referendum was Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , that many things , but not always to the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; as the sugar cane factory , or better than they began , they heard them off to paved the road to paved the road to paved the road . &quot;
&quot; without working in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories . &quot;
they were designed to spare parts .
&quot; without the future , there was a lot of young people around the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , their production serves not once for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .

&quot; on the day after a violent after@@ life , there is hardly any someone to live on the trau@@ ma or to the congregations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; after each bone , the children and daughters , children and daughters , children and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might be never healing . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; Fun@@ eral a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drugs live &quot; ) into the life that will give this sacrific@@ es to the fight between the criminal proceedings and rules of human rights . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime can not be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if the shops include , because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities , so many kilometers you need to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victim
&quot; a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ ge@@ que c@@ ity@@ at p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( english : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; one main character is Gu@@ adal@@ upe , a father who seek every weekend secret tom@@ bs to his son . &quot;

&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , for I am now alone with three children that need a training . &quot;
&quot; it is also my mother , who here is here in me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they will not be re@@ charged , because the mort@@ ality may demand . &quot;
where should we get the same ?

it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel the feeling when I am the only thing , or sad or sad . it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t use this as normal as normal .
write a review on this product .
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old C@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is great . and it is not normal to hear people about the &quot; hel@@ s &quot; of the crimes when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , they would have lost those who are lost , and those who have lost their fear . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to blo@@ om numbers in a statistics .
&quot; the Tat@@ en@@ ity of the people is unbeliev@@ able for me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ si@@ den@@ ers of 43 students have been justified by 43 students in one neighbouring village . &quot;
&quot; I think they try to talk about it , if they are not to stir them . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; four months in the main road , &quot; &quot; as a family with Dro@@ ps was killed , until they had been destroyed by their business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and how many people have completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of pain is never the trau@@ ma , the fear comes back , when you are alone . &quot;
you have changed the telephone numbers also .
contact us only if it is absolutely necessary if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; depending on the other we are removed , the better . &quot;
&quot; they made their report by the words : &quot;
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they lead you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I have asked me in these terrible days , whether we@@ eping my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , for I have forgotten how to live . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;

he tells of the nine N@@ uts on his left leg - one for every life year .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his sight - unnecessary for a boy for the whole life of violence , and to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother died . &quot;
but this was not the day that ended his childhood .
&quot; his childhood was already two years ago , when he saw a few blocks away from his home , the blu@@ ish corp@@ ses of his father saw his father who was shot by armed men out of the car &apos;s car . &quot;

the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence of Christians by Muslims or to the defense of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life in comparison to a European or French life .
religion will understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is important to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts .

&quot; with social media , there is plenty of people that have un@@ intended for the share of the water around a tragedy . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1.@@ 7 billion , we are deeply rooted in our unforgettable pedi@@ gree . our un@@ mistak@@ able history . &quot;
&quot; it means to remember that before the years ago , the most important military of the world , with troops that were over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , in the Iraq , in order to hunt mass destruction . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ ker was buried under the tru@@ ths of the war .
&quot; at the same time , more than 32 percent increase in the world has increased more than 32 percent . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy , as a tragedy , as a tragedy in the USA , the history of four times more reports , the history of four times more reports than a history with a white eye . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan shall be called by a liber@@ ated black slaves to the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist , called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , and was brought in this country . &quot;

we are too deeply rooted in the Muslim or the &quot; other &quot; to the other .
we have been able to recognise the roots of our fears and understanding of dangerous and dangerous expression that we are in our news editorial .
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , given by American Muslims within the media industry , who tried to create our fully with con@@ form@@ ated identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;

&quot; since it is still a different group , the expon@@ enti@@ ally grown , by calling the &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , they had not yet given them , but they have been given great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , global Vo@@ ices reported a new initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here is the focus of T@@ LS not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is a attempt to get the language variety of great cities . &quot;
&quot; actually , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Dar@@ win in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not very much , not to the born children . &quot;
the project is valid for the purposes of the project :
&quot; the mass of the world can be avoided when we create cities that are not forgotten - safe rooms , in which people are not forgotten who they are in order to be able to get . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; to understand this events , &quot; &quot; they will be able to listen to them in order to appreciate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format of history , history is first in their own language and then explain it to English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants don &apos;t have a professional history of history , they guide their devot@@ ion , and their representation in which it can be set up . &quot;
&quot; you call laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows a traditional story from Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the history of the R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou accounts will also be the opportunity to explain their country typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ omi ara took the thread from the h@@ asen and the scene in the language of Sh@@ ona in Zim@@ babwe : &quot;
&quot; after having explained the meaning of his name , John Ny@@ omi ara is asked to talk to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot;
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
we were very happy with me !
&quot; the events of Language Stor@@ y@@ makers have taken place in three cities , and the organizers have hope to organize the project with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own history . &quot;
&quot; Puerto Rico , Puerto Rico &quot;
&quot; with the aim of a new testing of the public debt from Puerto Rico , which led to 72 million US dollars in the past 3 April 2017 . the march was started in the pu@@ zz@@ ard of Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was called by the group &quot; f@@ ren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Mayor &apos;s front for the neur@@ ons of the debts ) and the church members of Puerto Ric@@ os . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a peti@@ tion on the official website of the White House of the United States is filed under the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is its request :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that the politicians , B@@ ones and government authorities who are responsible for the debt are responsible for their cor@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
we call for a financial verification and a management board without personal interests of the public debt , with a solid , our working conditions for the economy . &quot;
we are pres@@ st and mis@@ er@@ able .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a guilt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
we demand Instant measures .

these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , the measures will be taken away without the participation and conviction of citizens , from the people from the people . &quot;

it is a hom@@ age to bass and his work .
in the introduction it is :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements focused on open knowledge , and what the true cost are connected with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of open knowledge , have a side to see above the mist that we have to see above the mist that we have to see above the mist that we have to see above our different experiences . &quot;

&quot; to see how Bass@@ el has a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we today ?
what have we decided to do ?
what have we found in this process of partly extreme beliefs ?

perhaps there was none of Bas@@ tille cultural prot@@ otypes than the work which he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra is one of the most important archaeological sites of the world .
&quot; bass was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS everything was to do this architecture , not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bark@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; this step into the digital archae@@ ology and preservation have created a tim@@ eline that will be created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ question@@ able value . &quot;

&quot; according to the information of Facebook users in Myanmar , the unknown social network will have their posts from the net , because they played the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people &apos;s Indian origin or in general as an adj@@ ective . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , the A@@ scen@@ sion of nation@@ alist movements in the word has been an extremely rare con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , there is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as a Hass@@ an is used to represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the efforts to combat the Hass@@ an in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may seem to be brought together with racism in conjunction , but the word that calls itself not automatically Hass@@ an . &quot;
&quot; the context is important , and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reports that they have discussed the use of the word . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with the different mean@@ ings which have the same character as &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is also written in Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; cal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letter , as well as other words like &apos; cal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( cam@@ el ) , &apos; cal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( Kam@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a post of my friends was deleted today , because it was the word &quot; &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , he had asked his friends to the spiritual type , whether they would be w@@ aking as he made his back pain , by giving a word . &quot;
&quot; ( ku ) + the word &quot; &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) to Bur@@ mes@@ an - similar to the racial expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ ide is the opinion that they must be a radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook was a radical statement before it had to spread the sus@@ pic@@ ion to spread the sus@@ pen@@ se of racism . &quot;

it fil@@ let the word automatically .
it does not understand what you need to read on Fac@@ ility .
&quot; what it should be to analyze and control the post , and check it by selecting the desired words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ sen ) . &quot;
the good is that this dre@@ ad nation@@ alists to spread a rather good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ c@@ ate their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action a strong signal is to send a strong signal to all send the Hass@@ an , the efficiency of this strategy is not long enough . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ eks have proven that the c@@ ensu@@ r of impact often had a cat and mouse game , whereby the user &apos;s social networks are simple , a new word or alternative to express the word word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ate , like Facebook , started to delete his posts , when he wanted to delete his friends , that the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network , is said : &quot;
... when I was on this new Directive by Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I got the lights , items and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the post was not found the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ an radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with Hass@@ an :
&quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot;
&quot; in the Post , the author discusses his opinion about the extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations in the country . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook before the beginning of the initiative is more to do , for example the bur@@ mes@@ ic Internet community for advice : &quot;

such words will bring these words only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as whether they have a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; heritage cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they have found that they have made mistakes , they tried to rec@@ ti@@ fy them . &quot;

&quot; this kind of religious opposition was not a complicated thing , and at some point of doubt whether the opposition would be accepted at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the legislative process was discussed against the child before - despite the 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) the opposition , and an independent , which would be discussed in the representative house , where he would make a simple majority of him to the law . &quot;

she has decided for this issue because they can open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify women .
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands were not according to the name of their hus@@ bands , one thing that they are all guilty of guilty and never felt in question . &quot;

is Singapore City or Country ?
&quot; the question may be du@@ sty , as Singapore at international level is recognized as an independent state . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Ministry of Justice , Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ al@@ gam should be considered to be regarded as a city . &quot;
this work has triggered a debate in the blog .

this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io is accused to defend the logic to defend the existing authorized exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable country , let us say that we are not a land . &quot;
&quot; but in case you don &apos;t have to wait , it doesn &apos;t matter if you want to use it . &quot;
&quot; Singapore when you are not mine country , it is it ? &quot;
&quot; by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ um , the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he sent an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore will not measure the political system of Singapore to the other &apos; normal countries &apos; . &quot;
&quot; however , the idea that Singapore can be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York City , both cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the core point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er of the authorised representatives of the authorized members , the logic of logic , as they are better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ al@@ gam answers to his American guests in our press , our Ju@@ dea , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Rach@@ el Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ al@@ gam@@ ate , his opinion , since they did not understood this conclusion . &quot;
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to s@@ wal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is one of what country belongs to our city ... &quot;
I don &apos;t understand nothing .
I would like to clarify this point that I would have to clarify this point in order to clarify this point in order to be a part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by An@@ on on the blog , he shows that you should start to read the context of the conference in order to read the context of the testim@@ onies of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ cus better understand , according to those Singapore &apos;s city and no country . &quot;
read the wor@@ ding .
&quot; when he said that Singapore will be a &quot; city &quot; be as a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore will be important for us , even if we are free and fair elections . &quot;
&quot; he studied Singapore with cities in the United States , and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) . &quot;
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; he did not exist in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ al@@ gam@@ ate as a leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am aware of what was the Minister of Singapore , very ver@@ ted ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected - be with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ al@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I am doubt and I am not sure if he believes that he really believes that he does . &quot;

&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have a lot of toler@@ ances ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often know how &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should speak rather from the defence of the city .

&quot; if Canada has a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has no personality . &quot;

&quot; there are more than 20 years ago , since the Georgia war has been officially finished , but its N@@ uts are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern subur@@ ks in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the heart basin by Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ en . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Gre@@ ene , de@@ asi@@ t , Georgia and Denmark lived in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ en .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al characteristic .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the subur@@ ban of 16@@ 0,000 people were hardly increased by a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 0,000 people in this district . &quot;

&quot; at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a local older man . &quot;
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s difficult to finish this .
that all is a consequence of the war .
can I talk with you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community . &quot;
now there is only a paved road with burned @-@ in @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who lived on this place and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; around 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it is similar to other villages . &quot;
&quot; the Chr@@ is@@ ch@@ kov@@ sky , which is still one or two families , one can take care of the balconies , where they can be dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destructive house . &quot;
&quot; as they discover myself with the camera in the hand , they make them back immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother has been forbidden due to us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she has just been forbidden , that is all . &quot;
the girl fl@@ utter@@ ed her girl@@ friend and suddenly leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small turquo@@ ise mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; also at the Sub@@ marine economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) , such as cattle breeding , fo@@ aming and vegetable oil . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to go to the l@@ aps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .

after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; I remember every day , as the city and the war . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation with the end , a small boy is over us over . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destructive building and hidden itself .
&quot; a ball flies from the window , and another young boy . &quot;
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then turns the hill . &quot;
a group of children are now playing the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them stones on the ver@@ ed building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who make their lives in their lives .

&quot; on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places will be known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it will be ordered from a 59@@ th anniversary , a small woman with a cor@@ ridor ben@@ ches and golden earrings in Ted@@ dy@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; it means Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and is there . nevertheless , they know many under the name m@@ um Africa . &quot;
&quot; it is the fact that the fact that the hotel has become the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) is a goal for Afri@@ kaner and hatred , who has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and hatred that are on the trip . &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; the guests can comfortably sleep in 3 bedrooms where they can find 1 double bed , 2 single beds . &quot;
at the pre @-@ room there are a par@@ rot in a cheese .
&quot; there is no sign to the hotel , but hundreds of African and ha@@ unting migrants here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people in full @-@ bus@@ ses and the upper part of the coast will begin to call at : &quot; &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sitting outside on the map . &quot;
you would like to reject .
&quot; they also helps them , and brings them to hospital if they are sick , they buy them , they buy them with a bal@@ lot from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally published in Angola , has arrived in a short time . &quot;
&quot; I have asked him , if m@@ um Africa was an appropriate name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family of Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with its daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ ó ) signed with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , and will go to Boston . &quot;

&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; &quot; I feel that it fits to you because African women are very nice women . &quot;
thank you very much .
it has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very well .
&quot; in Sebas@@ ti@@ ao lives with his sister , who is going to get up to Boston , to get up her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ kan@@ ers who are on the way into the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then turn north . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ kaner often need to travel along the track , and that the Afri@@ kaner was already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his way , Michel@@ etti has lived in Brazil and has worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has begun his journey into the United States . &quot;

I wonder whether he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez contact .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we will never go back , &quot; reply to smiling . &quot; we will always remain in contact . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests are often spoken text messages when they continue to report them in order to report them over the course of their journey .
she explained that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her , chicken , like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only wireless hope for migrants who travel through tapes . &quot;
&quot; on the other end of the city , a sack to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; for this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and its family migrants are recorded in their small house . &quot;
&quot; he is polishing , and has been found that the bus tickets will be sold to numerous African migrants . &quot;
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for a dollar . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 persons , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ out outside . &quot;

&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , from Central America , other inhabitants open their houses of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ bier Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was f@@ lown in Honduras with his wife and his three children from the people who wanted from him to have a plan without a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he has asked for a stay and an in@@ famous , one solo , has offered her roof . &quot;

&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic for those that were gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grand@@ mother , she leaves them in their album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ w , which has made her a Kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old . &quot;

&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , for the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that was in the Ar@@ tery with state security @-@ organisms and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , the things got something beyond the current power supply in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I climb@@ ed the silence , by using several times &quot; &quot; Alla@@ ah Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house @-@ roof . &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends cour@@ age@@ ous enough to find . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me . we took us to a pra@@ et@@ ely picture , which was fully filled with my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you have liber@@ ated the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in Ger@@ ing@@ sten . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us in the military service building . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; then , I learned the following : no matter how much honey you go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have the whole path to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I also had now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an is said to speak : &quot; let me hear me , how you are &apos; Alla@@ ah Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are just cour@@ age@@ ous enough when we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ole eyes closed on me .
&quot; and you don &apos;t know what I look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , did nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my tor@@ ness , E@@ it@@ el@@ ah , perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was my thing as I answered : &quot; &quot; I have not thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I believe , I have never heard in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not have no word from what I said . &quot;

&quot; give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t stand up with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry fell into him not enough , why they took the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; in my first session , I asked to see if the investig@@ ators had been working again as a collection of work , or whether it was in the normal working class . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in@@ doors to present us , from their view , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within one single hour , three of them , while I still still have a number of them . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body , and my voice , why I heard it . &quot;

&quot; my hal@@ low@@ ed body , which was frozen on the ground , was the perfect power manager . &quot;
the Tau@@ b@@ ness and the pain was again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
that must have been in the midst of midnight .
&quot; I decided to place me again ; say , that was my only option . &quot;
some hours passed on to me as minutes .
then the call for the dawn .

&quot; otherwise , they had always released me . &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community - free speech and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ othi@@ es a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this article . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ ib brings the most of his time dr@@ ills , times to his computer , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; where one can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers , or with ni@@ cot@@ ine in the lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the right hand of his family @-@ house , which had been heard of his family members since 1967 ; the year , in Israel his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family were forced to fled from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for now six years H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate active activity that represents the conservative majority , and their well @-@ proven opinions of gender equality , sexu@@ ality and free expression of art and Rap@@ lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often confronted with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , but he also calls the heart of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only in their home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that are from Damascus to San@@ aa in Syria . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib says in his mind , and he can feel that in his mind , and he can feel that the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign policy in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open , he &apos;s not open to the U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
date added by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib believes not that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas - something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee &quot; of the second generation - so he has been born in Jordan , even if he was born in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life , &quot; says H@@ da@@ ib . &quot;
&quot; then he added : &quot; I think , because I am a human being , while in water sol@@ ves N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; in this time it is scheduled for Muslims to be set up until sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ ance Act also means that the public consumption of food during the Ramad@@ an illeg@@ ally is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions , on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ tim@@ ous j@@ ig@@ ag little with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the sl@@ ess , warm coffee and the Schwa@@ b of the K@@ ent cigarette smoke in the first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Jordan as a prison under free heaven , above all , when one sees a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramad@@ an Water - to drink not in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Minister Jord@@ ani@@ ens a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la had been said to the second time . &quot;
&quot; some of the parliamentary action , which support the Islam@@ isation of the Muslims - the j@@ ord@@ inal branch of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional norms of the country , says and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the president and former pres@@ tige in the Islamic Coalition of DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singers . &quot;
&quot; many say , the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is more dangerous policy in the whole region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ an people as a &quot; progressive support of human rights &quot; which is still expected for a intellectual and cultural Pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement does not seem to be simply sei@@ ze rhet@@ oric reality , but indeed a distinc@@ tly sharp reality in Jordan which reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 H@@ da@@ ib traditional sex ch@@ ats to Lei@@ be , by his vision of the destiny of Arab women . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown unknown woman , whose arms and legs up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through hands of those who want to trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years in Jordan , the number of &apos; Honor@@ ary mor@@ de &apos; was arrested . &quot;
&quot; according to the Human Rights Watch , the number of Trans@@ figuration is missing ; however , the institutional infrastructure is missing , in order to support women , the victims , murder or h@@ unters . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for crime control of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of internal violence , are often a years of bureauc@@ ratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman is nothing . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music has great popularity and is known for a great popularity and is known for not to return to the themes , which in his country long as a tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib says that his work is politically motivated , however , however , he &apos;s his music that is full of explicit films on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the seam , man . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; takes the question after the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; is the focus again on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs which are in the heart of politically , can continue to continue . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse was repeated : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone is also . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song describes H@@ da@@ ib the world as a kind of market , in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - be faith or non @-@ believe , hetero@@ - or hom@@ osexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that hardly any one in Jordan on the rights of pigs and Les@@ ben , and that comments for equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals can still remain strong in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib a interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments from the context , ver@@ ted and his opinion . &quot;
&quot; you can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 You can leave a response , or trackback . &quot;
today H@@ da@@ ib is open for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ oler@@ ance on hom@@ osexu@@ ality does not exist in Islam .
&quot; he mentioned in Abu Gh@@ ent , a poet of the eighth century that has stayed today thanks to its homogen@@ ous poems in memory . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ bia , who was later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century open on hom@@ osexu@@ ality , why can the Jordan was not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was told to do . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and the progressive voices .
&quot; more recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ alen news service has several former government officials and members of the teachers which are concerned with the deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; given that is the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , just the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
it is sure that these changes will take place in the hearts of the j@@ ord@@ n@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la . it is sure that these changes will take place in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an Society .
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ ib , like millions of others , also from an Arab world without inter@@ rup@@ tions from the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; he doesn &apos;t only have to do his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus to bring it to it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is represented by music , art and literature of a real and basic openness , and not through bombs , carbon and artificial species . &quot;
&quot; as far as far , H@@ da@@ ib is forced to pass and the resistance of resistance . &quot;

&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which had been used to live in constant fear and in some cases , and in some cases , these are now in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young company can help themselves be able to help the integration process .
&quot; and exactly that it did not matter , until now , the thousands of young people . &quot;
the goal of the campaign are 69@@ 00 per cent - one for each former Guer@@ il@@ la@@ k@@ man who will be personally informed of personally .

&quot; the idea for the letter to reconciliation has been done on the World Cup of peace talks , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there were Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi by 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who are forgotten that they need much care . &quot;
he continued to share in this year his love with people who had the most urgent demands on the most urgent need .
&quot; the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC that have to be able to make a new life in society , and to make a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make a common history of peace at a common history of peace , say they say . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the campaign , more than 2000 letters were collected . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all larger towns of Belgium , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive me &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ ence go into the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC created themselves , as they had done it to the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time , they received no commands , but a letter of sub@@ servi@@ ence of people from all the country . &quot;
&quot; it was incredible , how many different feelings you are in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies , &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs of the province of Valle del Gran@@ ca , this unforgettable experience is as follows : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , brought me a former fighters through the camp of the Guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I was in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the trump@@ ets of men live ) , I saw a smile on the face of something . &quot;
&quot; I had fear , because in addition to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ sink , a foo@@ lish weapon in the jar . &quot;
&quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they have just ? &quot; &quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; I have written a letter to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; in my life , my life has written something so beautiful , so I say that I was going to take my tears over the W@@ angen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps he was sorry to write all the years of the tre@@ aties of this cal@@ f@@ ers and would help him to write this letter .
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something of life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to store him , and his six brothers before the fam@@ ine . &quot; &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society that comes with open arms .
I just learned how I handle weapons with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace talks , I can learn many things and dignity in dignity . &quot;

&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a discussion round together . &quot;
&quot; the students were up to the war , and the F@@ ARC already was already in the def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; this is why we have experienced the leader of the F@@ ARC &apos;s history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , how we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to develop the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear the people who have had never been found nor did not have to say that people who have often seen as monsters , even people who have had often seen as monsters and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , do me . &quot;
&quot; but it looked me that all people - even those who have killed and so much damage to us , we can bring something to a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have given to the letters .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the question of the question is that it is not possible to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is ine@@ qualities , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment options , there will always be people who are ready to attack against the weapons , and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now is now on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; this is why we call all the defense of Peace on - no matter which breed , religion or ideology they belong - over all that is to recover from a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word to make our contribution and bring victims , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those under us who defend life as a basis of existence , are many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will be overcome . &quot;

&quot; they made absurd demands : some said to me , I have to prove that I had not changed in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and say that I was not in the official TV in Gros@@ ny . &quot;
what would I say to TV ? I have to say that I should say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said to my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , because you are a single woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a Stri@@ ck around the neck .
&quot; for luck , the neighbors and rescue them . &quot;
at the time I had to change several times on the day .
&quot; I went to a flat and already a few hours later , under the window a car with a dark window and a num@@ ber@@ jack with one 95 . &quot;
&quot; after the third time , it was clear to me that there was something bad . &quot;
&quot; my human rights of friends , &quot; &quot; Num@@ bers &quot; &quot; the num@@ ber@@ n@@ ment of the - it was out that I was asked . &quot;
OC Media : how are you f@@ lown ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for me , I want to give them a name , but I want to say that I have helped me all of them ; they have really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I put the land , but then pas@@ siv@@ ated something unexpected . &quot;
I cannot understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM @-@ card to call my mother . &quot;
&quot; I bought them , without prior notice , without notice , without anything . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t see my old SIM card , and threw them into the tr@@ ash . &quot;
he came to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot;
our people know how to eat . you know your room number .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 2,0@@ 57 257 &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; if you don &apos;t talk about sexual intercourse , we don &apos;t think that is a tablet . &quot;
&quot; we had a lot of traditional costumes , but I still have a lot of fun . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 2,0@@ 57 257 &quot;
&quot; I say that as long as my mother am life , I will do my best to hurt them not to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; if we want to chat with camera ch@@ ats , I really like to look like the person who reminds them out of their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed here ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have changed the last week in Washington .
&quot; for the needed , I needed to find actual information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with someone who had a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he told that during the Ramad@@ an of Ramad@@ an , he told us that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he saw a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; in order to ensure that my relatives , they will probably take care of the relatives of the person and at the end of a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; through our blood vessels . &quot;
OC Media : are now more gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?

&quot; if , before all that , there is no good relatives or the relatives of their relatives , to make Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are going to record them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be brought together , they will show their bodies on television , and say , they have been attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as soon as these people were not allowed to disappeared , but specifically speaking to the radical . &quot;
OC Media : is now only one source or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I call for someone that was a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their B@@ art was grown .
there was nothing new of them .
they have taken it easy .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was to be taken as these people . &quot;
&quot; however , there were no reports that there were no reports . we suggest that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
&quot; why otherwise we have not allowed these people to be able to sh@@ ave yourself ? &quot;
&quot; know whether these persec@@ utions and discover@@ ies of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I took my hair ever long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I don &apos;t think about 2003 I was known as I lived there - and I had never been problems .
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ mal@@ aria had never been problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much more secure than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia would lead us originally to the &quot; &quot; civi@@ lisation &quot; , &quot; but we finally returned to the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were sealed ; I was coloured lashes and the tube of the tube and the short t@@ ops .
the Security Council of Sch@@ aria has never been able to never use one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on week@@ ends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several bish@@ ops stood , and all the city of which they knew , why men were men , young people , there . &quot;
we were never ce@@ ased .
&quot; in this way , there is one example : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t know about the mis@@ fortune of one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is often difficult to children , if the crane can be funny . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they did not find their eyes before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; you have never seen me , never ce@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace be done ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , up to Kad@@ y@@ row came up on the plan . &quot;
&quot; when he appointed to the Prime Minister , he started to speak out on television about morality . &quot;
&quot; he said not about us , but the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; however , one could feel like the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time , when I came back home , I was able to feel the situation in the republic . &quot;
OC Media : what do you go to ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a Kell@@ ner@@ in .
I don &apos;t have a lot of - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the United States .
this is why I still have been active .
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;

&quot; many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims , who go into the mos@@ que , and during the Ramad@@ an , live with men . &quot;

&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exactly , different life settings . &quot;

&quot; a few people want to remove the flame again , and Mor@@ deca@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ si hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the combustion chambers were so strongly that the doctors could nothing more to do . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that could take in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists say that even more men could take to life . &quot;

&quot; their stories have a thing together : there were all family members who were able to walk on the persecution of the Iranian government , hil@@ t and able to walk their families to their families and a safe work . &quot;
&quot; the first Afghan Ski Challenge took place in 2014 , with the first half of the year . &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a majority of the Iran &apos;s Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community , has been sh@@ aken from a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to go to the local Arab population . &quot;
&quot; in front of a century the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a mainly aut@@ on@@ ome region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi @-@ mon@@ archy took the power took up and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in all Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most successful and most important surfaces for the Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to only slowly , and the local population will be only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; she is often victims of un@@ skilled diseases , hunger and Ent@@ ente . &quot;
the Iranian regime adopted the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arab@@ ians to work jobs in the local oil and gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
&quot; the government has also built a wide range of roofs , the water from the Arab countries , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m have to go . &quot;
&quot; these fluctu@@ ations have only led to the influence in the region by drying out of drying , and the local agriculture as well as the fish and pal@@ ms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab Jama@@ hi@@ zi @-@ young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for co@@ oper@@ atives , labour and social welfare , is that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for work , the basic school was completed , 55 % of the university studies and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of volunteers and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process is : &quot;
&quot; since functional and institutions are not preferred to the Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic politics of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the Spirit of national resistance to destroy them , and to force their lives outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who have to hide their way and follow the names to hide their responsibilities to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , as well as Arab names are not toler@@ ated , for the speech of the Arab language or the Arab clothing . &quot;

&quot; the following article is a revised version of the statement , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide las@@ i , and originally published on the website www.@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was a subject of several discussions where many different positions came to the term . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am no femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who are themselves as inter@@ sect@@ oral Fem@@ ini@@ st@@ in - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; you might be surprised , why I &apos;m not part of the movement . &quot;
&quot; they even do well thought scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we are generally speaking about Fem@@ inist . &quot;
&quot; for example , women nowadays tend to earn less money than men . &quot;
women still are still under str@@ anded observation when it comes to what they can do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women or later in various areas of life , in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is me aware and known .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I am on the skin of skin , on racism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or in black women . &quot;
&quot; but despite all that , women - all women - all women - together to sing &quot; their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my lord &quot; to sing the equality of women ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexual violence a institutional form of racial and motiv@@ ating violence , which we are black women on two different species . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , black women and women are less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant @-@ inter@@ activity often does not become a white girl because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; women with mig@@ rant women with mig@@ rant women with mig@@ rant workers are exposed to a higher risk , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ ality and violence in the partnership to suffer as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I will show that all men , all men and all human rights ; on the other hand , I can join me as a black woman not a movement in their mind , which may refer to their mind , which refer to the gender as well as to the skin of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted , and I will not have more about my refuge in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented don@@ keys that have me and countless other black women and ever again . &quot;
&quot; in his speech : &quot; I am no woman in their speech , &quot; &quot; I am no woman ? &quot; &quot; and I will give me a ideology , in which the black woman in historical terms is a ent@@ rusted and edi@@ ble Bein@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t refuse myself to see me group@@ ings , which in addition to cultural events and gro@@ ves , in order to make it more centralized program . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t try to try white women , the importance of beliefs of skin and gender equality . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to support them a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sect@@ oral femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of various members to enter the home , and it is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I love it , full of femin@@ ism and the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman into life , rather than a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm to use for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm to use it as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and to us into the sp@@ inning of us that are of us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ eks , the author of the book of African countries : how we are able to defend ourselves on our own type , and not only the - black women can be able to defend ourselves on our own type . and not only the - black women can be able to defend ourselves on our own type . and not only the - black women can be able to defend ourselves , and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be found that the black woman . &quot;
&quot; in fact , some white and inter@@ sect@@ oral fem@@ ini@@ st@@ eries immediately are to inform themselves to inform them about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a peaceful environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for example in this paradigm shift . &quot;
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can be used in a environment , in which my life is neither excessive , nor ignored . &quot;

the Teu@@ fel@@ lowship of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are at once accepted , they will receive no support by the stadium . &quot;
&quot; this explains why only 20 % of all women , the victim of violence , to be sacrific@@ ed by violence , in the case of the criminal authorities . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is not a matter of course , but it is not a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to learn how many women really mis@@ led , the my@@ elin gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z , research project for Gen@@ der@@ abad , a social scientific research equipment in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that have explained the extent of gender specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;

&quot; in 2015 , the district apostle issued 9@@ 600 ads due to h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ ality . at 70 % of which it went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads due to h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ ality , also here 86 % of the ads of women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads of 40 % of women , that they were in women , 55 % of women said of psych@@ ic pain . &quot;

un@@ visible defects and a legal system that does nothing under@@ takes
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was born in Carlos Vera , he was informed that it was the name of all of its former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , they did not find them , but then after that , they should always be given them for ever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana 28 years old and not more with Carlos together .
I would never thought that I would have to be sacrific@@ ed by failure .
&quot; when I read earlier this I thought I thought that only women happens to be under@@ gone , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the Mis@@ ery by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote the contributions on Facebook , in which they did his reward and various attacks during their two @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ical , whether he had given the hand against them , and that his behaviour should also be a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they did not leave the so long by Carlos . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mis@@ si@@ ties could have been killed . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not out of Paraguay who took almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partners they refused . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of ini@@ quity .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other . &quot;
do you do what many others do not do : you take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as a case began all with psych@@ ic pain .
&quot; it &apos;s a good idea to convince her to convince her to convince her to convince her , that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads in authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; they led a process against their former partner who developed into an un@@ ambig@@ uous legal struggle between Paraguay and their hom@@ land , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partners . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the question of this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to say anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very well , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of missions is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri : representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay who looks great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament was discussed under the H@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Princ@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; this H@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ min@@ e@@ Wen@@ ders ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Amnesty International . &quot;

medical research in Africa is only rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that one of the most urgent needs of the continents .
&quot; there are two reasons : for a missing in the range of global healthcare services , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , Tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ osis and Mal@@ aria have been widely engraved effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa &apos;s far un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive effects of the pharmaceutical companies and the pharmaceutical companies are a great problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , the research that is carried out by African scientists itself is performed at the building of the own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be sufficient for economic growth of the continents . &quot;

what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
&quot; RW : there is no basic research . we use only solutions that have been developed different . &quot;
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here . &quot;
re : where is the financing and support ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported as well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 2,0@@ 57 257 &quot;
which obstacles are in your routine research work which you did not had before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure corresponds to the standards in developed countries . it costs lot of money , a continuous supply with electricity , water and Internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
&quot; posted : how big is your opinion to the potential of scientific research in Africa , where they should concentrate , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , beginning in every age . &quot;
&quot; social Science , Computer Science , Big Data , Study of the World @-@ ms , Health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and amor@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to describe the advantages and disadvantages of life in Africa with Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often are the limited speed , things , and the values of scientific expertise that represent the challenges here . &quot;

&quot; from the USA to India : such as &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed production &quot;
this post by Rach@@ el C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com
Frank M@@ orton has been nominated for the 1980s in the United States .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant that has been developed by NASA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in the world . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mort@@ ons was set up with its own hands and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ fish can get to limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more sal@@ aries were pat@@ ched , and that he could not use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patches are not only suitable for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more of these patents have been created more and more plants such as cereal - or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant species , environmental protection and experts for food security in order to ensure the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ ium old tradition , M@@ orton still has more salad , he needs more than more restrictions than ever more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would be a rock in a river , around which I have to do . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is a coalition with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patches are going to be far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they keep before judgment , no one can get more a new sal@@ aries because all features are already patented , because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use a material that is protected as a spiritual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also connected a movement that is in the USA and all over the world , open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; . &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts the International Space Station ISS , red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ded in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station &quot; and eat it . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in the world . &quot;

it is no chance that this name is rather as sounds as the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software .
&quot; it was founded in life to ensure that some plant species , not being protected as a spiritual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the initiative , short of O@@ SSI , US @-@ bre@@ eders can be compulsory , that others can use the seed of them as well . &quot;
&quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to buy their seed for their seed . &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others to buy their seed for their seed , and not immediately . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already connected to the initiative since their start in 2014 .

&quot; seed also plays a role in larger ones such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg also emphas@@ ised that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement does not exist with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need to purchase control over the seed markets , we need control over the seed markets , as well as for sustainable vegetables , such as the farmers market , should also know that the way it is in August or September 2016 . &quot;
the sovereignty of sovereignty and sovereignty is not possible .
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative will continue to provide others to provide others to provide others in contrast to the seed of seed and plant features .

&quot; for other plants there are such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mas@@ sen@@ sing plants such as wheat in even greater style are available as salad or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are so willing to ensure their desired characteristics - from such that their taste or color improves up to such as due to those of them in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ellets or diseases .
genetic diversity is at the same time that the available plant material for bre@@ eders . genetic diversity is currently being cultivated than ever since the changes due to climate change are much worse than ever before changing the changes due to climate change .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail realize Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ aders in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto , that genetic diversity is important and essential for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . &quot;
&quot; however , however , the majority of other bre@@ eders do not support other bre@@ eders . &quot; &quot; a patent is taken in fact a plan that can follow as soon as the patent is raised . &quot;
often help others to come to another way with another method to come to the same result .
&quot; as a result of such protection , innovation does not exist , but promotes them by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; M@@ orton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent run , you certainly certainly have any innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you are waiting for a long time to go to plants , which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for M@@ orton is that genetic resources always have been a general well , and it will continue to remain the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tive are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; that &apos;s what we do , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest gene@@ tics resources . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to implement the concept of itself , plant features : &quot; we create the features not really . &quot;
&quot; the plants they themselves from and as bre@@ eders , we don &apos;t have a c@@ lue how to do the plants . &quot;
a secret of nature .
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ SSI Member of the board , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who has a sorting , even its own values in it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great courtesy and mon@@ ocular cultures are required for their cultivation in the cultivation of organic farming .
my concept is precisely precisely .
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) pat@@ ente , they create most smaller seed companies , even without pat@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; the independent theater of Frank M@@ orton speaks to his breeding garden of Sal@@ ate . &quot;

&quot; M@@ orton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ war@@ eness of the plant &apos;s innovative would be : &quot; it looks so that I can produce new efforts to produce new things , more than companies that produce . &quot;

&quot; in the open source &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; in the open source &quot; &quot; breeding &quot; &quot; the concept of the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; is now too fast on the whole world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which is the centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , a &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed program works with farmers and helps them to meet new varieties that meet specific requirements . &quot;
&quot; they also supports the Open Source &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; and to sell their own own . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the &quot; Open Source &quot; License , it is based on a &quot; Open Source &quot; license which is ultimately a form@@ able and legally binding form of the O@@ SSI obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country , due to the O@@ SSI obligation not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of November , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , the European Commission , explained that it is not allowed to prevent the current practice of the European patent applications . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is yet not a law ; now it is to bring to the governments of the Member States , the Patent Office to bring this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os a conference at the Open Source &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed movement and the global trend for patents of seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the open source &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , that the organisation is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official starting point . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose we would like to hear your opinion , wishes and suggestions . we kindly ask you to take about ten minutes to take part in this Online Survey . online Survey Information for survey participants &quot;
&quot; in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food and other - a report , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published in the future . &quot;
&quot; in the report also the importance of a manifold , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection to the Lu@@ by of O@@ SSI , that it will soon be possible to recognize him soon . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is mainly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind her food is . &quot;

&quot; in August , the network provides a position on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities are sharp and critic@@ ised the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in this part of the World Network for Human Rights Information , however , it was never so important to meet the freedom of freedom and human rights in the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered as the first zen@@ ed website of human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities received before more than two months 21 pages , such as for the independent publication of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar &apos;s network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era , due to the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we are not able to close our eyes before the grave . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was divided on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ etta , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision is no reason for pride , but rather a sign of the man : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war in a country that could not realize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper has to be controlled by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 8@@ 43 countries , which will be controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
the newspaper is further :
&quot; it is aware that a war interaction , if it is broken , can also be used to be used . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on the information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilians , but the economic power of the army and its partners . &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; more than they use ? &quot;
&quot; in a article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil argued , the journalist of the Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , published the violence as &quot; war &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself , - in combination with structured investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ este@@ em of public service . &quot;
&quot; for memory : the state Rio de Jan@@ eiro is greater than just his capital . &quot;
