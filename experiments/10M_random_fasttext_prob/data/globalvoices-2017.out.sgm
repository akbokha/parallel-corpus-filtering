<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Mortons was set up with its own hands and the question of how many Salatfish can get to limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salaries were patched, and that he could not use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patches are not only suitable for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more of these patents have been created more and more plants such as cereal - or cartons. due to this trends, plant species, environmental protection and experts for food security in order to ensure the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millenium old tradition, Morton still has more salad, he needs more than more restrictions than ever more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would be a rock in a river, around which I have to do."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "I think it is a coalition with the breeding tradition," says he. "I think that these patches are going to be far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they keep before judgment, no one can get more a new salaries because all features are already patented, because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and endeavoured to use a material that is protected as a spiritual property."</seg>

<seg id="2645">"it was founded in life to ensure that some plant species, not being protected as a spiritual property, and so for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the framework of the initiative, short of OSSI, US-breeders can be compulsory, that others can use the seed of them as well."</seg>

<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg also emphasised that the "Open Source" movement does not exist with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need to purchase control over the seed markets, we need control over the seed markets, as well as for sustainable vegetables, such as the farmers market, should also know that the way it is in August or September 2016."</seg>

<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so willing to ensure their desired characteristics - from such that their taste or color improves up to such as due to those of them in certain environments and threats such as pellets or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Genetic diversity is at the same time that the available plant material for breeders. genetic diversity is currently being cultivated than ever since the changes due to climate change are much worse than ever before changing the changes due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail realize Monsanto-Spreaders in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is important and essential for Monsantos activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, however, the majority of other breeders do not support other breeders." "a patent is taken in fact a plan that can follow as soon as the patent is raised."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often help others to come to another way with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"as a result of such protection, innovation does not exist, but promotes them by the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent run, you certainly certainly have any innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting for a long time to go to plants, which are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general well, and it will continue to remain the money for such formalities, and monetary incentive are not attractive for us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that's what we do, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetics resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"it is also possible to implement the concept of itself, plant features:" we create the features not really. "</seg>
