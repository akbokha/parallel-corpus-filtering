this is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; they know him , because he won as a New York Times @-@ Times the Pul@@ itzer Prize . &quot;
&quot; for long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en a book , in which he heard a book , in which he heard a book in which he heard the NSA acts by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a remaining impression .
&quot; in it , he describes a catastro@@ phic US intelligence officer , in which the CIA was literally sub@@ stituted for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On November 2 , 2012 &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know how the chapter isn &apos;t done ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government was established against Ris@@ en and asked to call its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he was the symbol for the sample of the government , Whist@@ leb@@ ell was asked to condemn the journalist and journalists . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right to use this right if media will not get information , and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the mu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; so when the government in Ris@@ en climb@@ ed , he did something about what many mu@@ en@@ ists already did before him : he refused , and said that he would go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en thus lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , pas@@ times something different . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were years of years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were killed . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time electronic monitoring , the reporter and sources can always hide less less . &quot;
&quot; instead of moving and Ris@@ en to the statements , you may also need his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , his phone call is concerned , &quot;
&quot; as such as its e @-@ mail data , financial and credit information , financial and bank information , its credit rating , and even travel information with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they were useless in order to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA @-@ Whist@@ leb@@ ate and Ris@@ ens the general source . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; President Obama said on his departure , Whist@@ leb@@ owski himself . but instead he has condemned the justice to him as all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government too much of their work . &quot;
&quot; since the 11th of September , almost every article about national security was the result of that a Whist@@ leb@@ ell was going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we also set the press work on the game , which will be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government is always more opportunities to inform you all of them . &quot;
&quot; but as the technology of government allowed to handle the rights of rep@@ lication , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , they can take it from the moment when they turn to contact , instead of return . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that had not been written , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is sec@@ ure@@ x , an open source @-@ source code system for Whist@@ leb@@ ell , which was developed by the people of the Press Foundation , which was developed by us of the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I work , was developed . &quot;
&quot; instead of an e @-@ mail , go to a News website , as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send documents or information , such as with each individual form . &quot;
&quot; this will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which has access to the relevant news agency . &quot;
&quot; for example , the government does not have more information such information , and many of the information that it would not be available from the United States . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments are becoming increasingly interested in the world over the world . &quot;
&quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology practices such as Edward Snow@@ den has an opportunity to protect ini@@ quity . it is just important that we protect the next step @-@ care , &quot;
&quot; at the end of the last few years , the United States and the United States will continue to take part in the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; all these technologies were not only for those who wish to cover the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;

the publication of this documents are a small insight into the secret world of control .
&quot; we will receive an impression of such as customers , banks and lawyers , such as Mos@@ aic Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need a anonymous company . &quot;
&quot; we see the e @-@ mails , exchange of news , such as all the system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
the Prime Minister is back .
there are reports that a allies of brutal Syrian dict@@ ators B@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Assad troops in control o@@ ases .

&quot; it seems to be we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we go ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the situation , their property in control is to hide and not all their taxes , then means less money for important public services such as health , education , streets . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these are po@@ uring ph@@ er@@ om@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world , media and leading politicians , as the secret control of some of these are used to hide their property and wear to wear -- something that we discuss since ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think , many people will definitely be very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how this control work . &quot;
I feel like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; it is a company in a different company , in a further company what it is almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it may be very difficult for criminal prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter .
&quot; probably , because there were no prominent Americans who came to those who came to that scandal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not so that there is no other Americans to hide their wealth in control . &quot;
&quot; but through the principle , after this control , Mos@@ aic Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have a data l@@ eck of the Cayman Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Las Vegas , we would have much more cases and examples , the connections in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need to find in some U.S. states less information , less information , to get a company in order to get a bibli@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; this type of in@@ transparent in the United States has allowed the staff of school groups , school children . &quot;

it is this kind of behaviour that is concerned by us .
&quot; here with Global Wit@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out how all this is in practice . &quot;
how does it work ?

it really really is that all up to a lawyer of our investig@@ ators suggestions how he could search for money .
&quot; there were all pre@@ oper@@ atives . none of these lawyers took us to us as a client , and of course , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .

&quot; it &apos;s not about a single pole female , burning in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , control , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to overcome this , we must change the rules of rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to develop this kind of behaviour .
&quot; as if we could do nothing , than whether it would have been changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; in the last few years we have seen signs to more transparency , what the owners of companies is concerned . &quot;
the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then the EU in central reg@@ ist@@ les on national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is returned to the United States .
&quot; the representatives of both parties have made a draft on both of the parties , but this does not seem to see the progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s testim@@ onies , this huge insight into the world of control , as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally for more transparency . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see , like other people have to hide their true identity behind head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; we need managers in the economy , and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who can recognise the problem , and to stop this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which can now end this kind of control , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted , and in the trunk of a red camp . &quot;
&quot; a day after I had completed my design with my design , I made a back@@ yard . &quot;
&quot; a type of red Mazda remained , and looked at my words . &quot;
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ side by the whole country . then he would go to peace scor@@ ps .
he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the invoice , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you speak for today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ?
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; but I don &apos;t know him , but I don &apos;t know if he would be able to go to peace , but I don &apos;t want to go back in the trunk room of the Maz@@ ars ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I have sleeping a air @-@ rat@@ chet . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I went to the bed , I started to the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; oh man ! what is I built to me there ? &quot;
a wild bo@@ unc@@ le in my living room .
&quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
&quot; I got a fear that I went out from the bed , to ti@@ ghten the door to the door , and my dor@@ mit@@ ory door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the art work , which he bought from me today is today in his class room . he is now teacher . &quot;
that was my first experience as hosts . it has completely changed my vision .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger .

we wanted to figure out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; so , we presented to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people open public images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bakery -- the type of room , their doors , and their bathrooms are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can feel wild people to stay in them with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing !
we waited for the ro@@ omm@@ ate .
&quot; indeed , they are not . &quot;
&quot; no one who will invest in Tro@@ st would invest in a business , the stran@@ gers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
&quot; because we have lear@@ nt as children all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous . &quot;
&quot; if one has a problem , you can find out the things that can be good . we were able . &quot;
at the art Academy we had learned that design much more is than only look and H@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall appearance .
&quot; we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning , we have made some things wrong . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for the people , negative ship departments . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest hospitality , before we set it online . &quot;
last week we have found something new .
&quot; we analyzed with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely it is that people can trust each other , depending on the age and residence . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks , we trust the people most of the most interesting . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less you will trust . &quot;

here you can see the reactions to the first message of a host .
&quot; if you are too short , how to &quot; Hi ! &quot; , you will be rather a answer . &quot;

&quot; there are so an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art of art in your apartment ! I make my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with Design to create these degree of openness ?
we also use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips for what to do something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help us to overcome our preju@@ dice from stran@@ gers .
&quot; what we did not believe , was the great multitude of people who had more than ready to put these preju@@ dice . &quot;

hosts are guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I have worked on the customer service . all calls came directly on my phone . &quot;

I will give you the guilt for your negative impressions .
the media people who look like I like .
a study showed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
&quot; on the other hand , the Americans have been able to know that most of them would not be Muslims . &quot;
&quot; as a result , people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber driving . &quot;
&quot; for all those who have never learned a Muslim , it is great to get to know . &quot;

&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to come to me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual human , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you love yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the same time , a femin@@ ist independence was a femin@@ ist independence and the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt that I felt a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty . &quot;
&quot; I have not accepted the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have done with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; I read him , thought in question , in question , and believed in vain . &quot;
my relationship to God was not love on the first sight .
it was confidence and slow devot@@ ion that are deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mic brings me sometimes to the wines .
I know myself yourself . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; you have ever had the feeling that someone wants to know , and don &apos;t love yourself ? &quot;
so it feels good .
&quot; later on , I started and started as all good Egyp@@ tians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in fact the &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had come to the end of the screen , looked upon the screen and saw the word . &quot;
&quot; smoke was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ ans out of buildings . &quot;
what was this ?
a accident ?
a technical disorder ?
&quot; my shock said , &quot; &quot; I said to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why should we do so ?
... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country , but in the N@@ u related to me the works of others from one citizen . &quot;
&quot; on the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the United States to move into a new city , and begin with the structural studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , how I drove down to my seat , and I went to my seat in my sitting room and I made me the first time as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
we stayed in this night in our apartment in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; and I heard , and I saw the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , including &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful &quot; , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d carefully , &quot; &quot; meetings of you not . &quot;
I stayed with the whole week .
&quot; then there were Friday in the week -- the day , to whom Muslims came to the B@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings , &quot; &quot; not at this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were mis@@ led and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or from people who have held for Muslims , to the Free Trial , and struck them . &quot;
there were really fire fighting on mos@@ que .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but a little felt really good .
&quot; because the people who were attacked , our land are attacked . &quot;
I have the anger of the people on the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not easy to explain themselves to explain themselves .

&quot; when the ra@@ fting process has been found that he can be cut into a brain , even from her family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who believe that their behaviour , and their ideology , is an inheritance or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must keep people to go to mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; some will still say that Islam is a violent religion . &quot;
&quot; finally , a group like the IS their bro@@ ker with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Mus@@ lim@@ in , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would like to add us in their subur@@ bs when they are known as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; on the other hand , the ideology of the &quot; &quot; Holy Bible &quot; &quot; is an important part of the &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but when one sees a look at them , they don &apos;t understand what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; las@@ en . &quot;
it is their bro@@ ality that it may be able to read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
&quot; an impressive image , told me an amazing history : &quot;
a girl came to him because they would have had to close the IS .
&quot; I was really surprised and asked him , whether they were in contact with radical religious leaders . &quot;
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every body , with which she had spoken , she had spoken to the silence , and said to her , her anger , their sense for injustice in the world , they only bring it to difficulties . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that was given to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts that you have a solution . &quot;
this image followed the link to God and its congregation .
&quot; instead of her anger , he showed a constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; in the mos@@ que , they were in the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; this was an insight how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia was , and my family is concerned . &quot;
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it works on every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day on our democracy on our mind ?
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ biology studies -- include : if we fear to fear , at least three things . &quot;
&quot; we accept an authorised government system , conformity and preju@@ dice . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you have concerns about test@@ oster@@ one messages in which negative , Muslims were reported to the Muslim countries , as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the Rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only a ak@@ ade@@ mia problem .
&quot; if you look , when the mood against Muslims according to Muslims : between 2001 and 2013 -- then came this three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Ira@@ k@@ war and during two European elections .
&quot; this is Islam@@ opho@@ bia not just the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a tool for manipulation of the public , to express the foundation of a free society , reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
what is the difference between Muslims is a early warning sign .
we feel it perhaps as the first but the toxic air of fear .
it is not only about to explain themselves to explain themselves .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chap@@ el Hill , North Carolina , where they went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a athletes .
&quot; he was at the dental techni@@ cian , talented , much @-@ friendly ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , spacious man who knew her . &quot;
&quot; she visited him there , and he showed her CV . she was amazing and said : &quot;
&quot; when it comes out of my sister , such a sealed young man has become a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne near her brother and his wife , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , they murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was looking for Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;

what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
we went to mos@@ que or stayed there at home ?
&quot; we took it and for us was not a slight decision , because it was so easy for us to control our children : one that would be able to control us by fear , or one that we can do our religion . &quot;
we decided to go for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we went up with high pressure to mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out of my shoes , went into the prayer of prayer , and what I saw that I saw me . &quot;
the hall was filled with the rest of the hall .
&quot; then the image has been a notice , thank@@ ed and called our guests , for the half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , and non @-@ believers who had come , not to see us . &quot;
&quot; in this moment , I was broken . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion of panic and preju@@ di@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you sure to go on ?
or will you join them that we are better than the ones .
thank you .

&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v . &quot;

what would you say to those people say ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you do not . I am totally normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am no exception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my story is not un@@ common .
&quot; I &apos;m so usually , as it is allowed . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the Muslims on the whole world , and I did the world with the largest one in the world , we want to be normal things . &quot;
they want to prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception is usually the rule , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;

&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : this are some of the possible applications for commercial purposes . &quot;
&quot; before air strikes in our social consciousness , a aut@@ on@@ ome fleet of aircraft machines at the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower in the F@@ RAC Centre in France . some years ago she began to fly with Sei@@ len . &quot;
&quot; due to insulation , air @-@ conditioning units are high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ binding structures .
they have lear@@ nt to carry out loads to deal with Tur@@ bul@@ ations and generally need to respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the self @-@ autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system of aut@@ on@@ om needs to know the collective of the mobile objects , where in space , the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our lab at ET@@ H Zurich we use external cameras to find objects , which allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; for today demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alisation technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a call of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
every aircraft machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space where the machine should do .
&quot; External commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so@@ called stern starter , &quot;

&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ vol@@ g@@ ler , it is efficient , much more efficient as helicopter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ asp@@ gl@@ ers , it is pregnant , and has a large advantage at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a one side . &quot;
a restriction of rear suspension is that they respond to Tur@@ bul@@ ls like wind@@ ti@@ en .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device is able to re@@ construct the optimal position and the performance can be improved by exercising .
thank you very much .
&quot; during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that are the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter parts are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that can order to hurt you .
&quot; in front of decades , pilots were able to fly @-@ controlled air@@ planes , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear of the rear . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ holi@@ est , which is mechan@@ ically optimised and remote control unit . it was invented for short@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no hook , hing@@ es and cross sections , no other actu@@ ator drives , or con@@ dens@@ ate surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ic , it happens in the inner life very much , so it can be stable and move in space . &quot;
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
&quot; the probability that it is right to understand when you see all , is low , and will show you a video that was founded in the evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ els is an exercise in gen@@ ü@@ gs@@ dorf , this machine is here , the omni@@ pot@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow . &quot;
what do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .

&quot; in this way , he receives the most advanced ability , &quot;
&quot; in space in all directions , no matter in which direction he was shot or even as he did . &quot;
&quot; naturally , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot of models available in models , the rest will learn directly to the city . &quot;
we look forward to seeing you .
&quot; if aircraft machines once again should be part of our everyday , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this is the watch ?
and the other against the clock .
&quot; if you use it , behavior can be used as a high @-@ high @-@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something like a motor or prop@@ eller is made out of the electronics or a battery -- the machine will continue to fly further if it is restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that we will be able to make a half hour un@@ able .
the last demonstration was examined in synthetic sw@@ elling .
the large number of autonomous heating , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;

&quot; every unit , where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine as we would like to make the Broad@@ way a flying lamp shade .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to change the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types such as us lies in the development and the Schaff@@ er .
&quot; it serves as memory , as wonderfully and magical our universe , and that it allows creative , well @-@ being allowed to form a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology , such a mass and economic potential , is the road to the river on the i . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far remote gal@@ ax@@ y two black holes will always be faster , you walked through the mass of tri@@ mm@@ ers in a ten @-@ second in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they were bright as all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known as all the stars of the whole . &quot;
it was a very large Kn@@ all .
&quot; they put their energy , but they did not work in the form of light . &quot;
we speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been rated into the space @-@ time tissue itself and the universe exploded in Gra@@ vit@@ ae shafts .
&quot; in addition , we make the events first time . &quot;
&quot; prior to 1.3 billion years , there was a considerable life on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has been brought to the earth : coral , fish , plants , Sau@@ ri@@ er , people and -- God bless us at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; for about 25 years ago , a group particularly cour@@ age@@ -- Ra@@ i white from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser beam detector to seek the gra@@ vit@@ ous black holes . &quot;
most kept it for crazy .

in the follow @-@ up time the precision of LI@@ GO could significantly increase the precision performance .
&quot; therefore , man is called Advanced Light . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO for a final test started to clarify some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissioning of the detection area , the gra@@ vit@@ ability of the two col@@ li@@ ent black holes by the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
&quot; Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this : &quot;
the Birth of my daughter
and the man of my to@@ d@@ sick father .
&quot; in fact , the fruits of my life is the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend , is not science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and col@@ t Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist on the MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is an herbs in the poem of space and time .
&quot; while the wave of the wave will be the space and the whole content into a direction , and in the other direction . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , lect@@ urer in Kur@@ sen was often considered a correct dance . &quot;
&quot; weight : 0,@@ 40@@ kg &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ability is extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on 14th of September , for example , each of us have the waves of the waves . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 error after the com@@ ma , followed by a 1 , said the LI@@ GO staff for me@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and it is already absurd to have this length on less than a fraction of the radius of a nuclear power . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
&quot; at the end of his classical text , grav@@ itation &quot;
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunting after the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such forces are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ c@@ ist are er@@ ical and with the support of the public will be able to overcome all obstacles .
&quot; Thor@@ ne , published 1973 , 42 years ago before his success . &quot;
go back to LI@@ GO . Scott says the LI@@ GO has more an ear than a eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical . for so , you can create a picture or a map of things by creating out more points of the light around you . &quot;
&quot; in killing , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; for this reason it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will help you to find a lot of things : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we have a lot of features such as sound level and height , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind the story . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ takes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
go to the top of the page
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ae shafts .
we have no simple images of objects in all .
&quot; but by using changes in Am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
&quot; at least , LI@@ GO has measured the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area . &quot;
&quot; if we do like wavel@@ ength in Sch@@ all , we can listen to the All @-@ fashi@@ oned . &quot;
&quot; the grav@@ itation of the grav@@ itation can give us a lot about the col@@ li@@ sion of two black holes , but my col@@ t Scott has long been busy . &quot;
SH : two black , not rot@@ ated holes , just as easy : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very quickly , hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional ton@@ art@@ ing . that sounds like w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@
this is a sort of movement in the wavel@@ ength in the wavel@@ ength range .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , that at least I never forget what he wants to hear about this than the noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ f@@ lange sunlight , which is about as fast as the Stä@@ bler of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : I think we are briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most powerful body in all , one with a mass of 29 probe , the other with a mass of 36 probe , the other with a mass of 36 probe , the other one hundred times per second before they colli@@ ded . &quot;
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
the remaining significance of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a completely new way to approach the algae like they never before .
&quot; in this way , we can listen to the All @-@ in and the Un@@ visible . &quot;
&quot; in all , we can &apos;t see it -- practically or basically -- not to see . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned much about the All .
&quot; the exciting physical operations , however , in the heart , which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicone . &quot;
&quot; we will never see , since this enlarged . &quot;
&quot; Gra@@ vit@@ ae waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would have been transparent glass . the Ur@@ gent . I would like to explore the first minutes of the al@@ ls but we will never see , since the ur@@ gency is covered by its own lights . &quot;
it should be possible to return to the beginning of the beginning .
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have never seen . things that we can only see if we hear . &quot;
&quot; indeed , LI@@ GO will be equal in the first stop things that we cannot expect . &quot;
&quot; my col@@ oring on the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this issue : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes how LI@@ GO they observed , are the Din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , old body made of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so , the Sau@@ ri@@ gh@@ no@@ des for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO allows us to create a completely different angle of the events in all , on the origin of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be afraid to be as good as possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build a great aesthetics , and the rough@@ ness of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
what could be more beautiful than the ur@@ inary itself ?
now the time is great dreams .

I don &apos;t want to im@@ press this .
&quot; I say , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you , whether you are working on a company , a country or a class room , a business or class room , a business or a class room , a business or a class room , a business or business , if I say , I understand that it is not a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , everything that reality , all reality , all the blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am going into the work , there is no other sense . &quot;
my work is always a country from the earth .
&quot; it is , when I began troops , when I went on a screen . &quot;
&quot; as I got a high sound , supply e a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all the same time .
I love it .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stres@@ s@@ ful and un@@ ob@@ tain@@ able , so@@ othing and mat@@ ing , cruel , cruel , cruel , cruel , and reasonable , and the best of it is the Sum@@ men . &quot;
there is so a change in me when the work is good .
&quot; a sum@@ m@@ ness starts in my head , and grows and grows , and the Sum@@ men listen to the street , I could ever drive for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people take them , if I knew the Sum@@ mon , that I am writing writing , that letter to me joy . &quot;
&quot; if you are not wrong , do not understand me . &quot;
&quot; but the Sum@@ men -- as I began working with television production , as I began to work and work , and discovered this thing , this Sum@@ men , this energy . &quot;
the Sum@@ men is more than writing .
Sum@@ men is action and activity . the Sum@@ men is a threat .
the Sum@@ men is music . the Sum@@ men is light and air .
the Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have a sum@@ p , then you can &apos;t be different than to size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling is not different to strive to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ men .
or perhaps you can also be a work@@ ah@@ oli@@ c .
perhaps it is a genius .
perhaps it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know that I am not sure that I am not responsible for divor@@ ce , and I know that I love the Sum@@ men . &quot;
&quot; I will tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I want it not to question . &quot;
&quot; in order to set up a clear : the more of the more ... more to more than ever , the more work , the more things , the more things , the more things , the more things , the more things , more , more , more , more , more , more and more expectations . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more must have to work . &quot;

&quot; I made the same things like always : the same version of Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , high @-@ day weekend , no re@@ visions , a Titan b@@ ft , not on , with all your heart , clear eyes , what is always . &quot;
but there were no sum@@ men .
in me I was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I had a lot of fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the Sum@@ men and the Sum@@ men was .
&quot; what makes you think about what you do , the work that you love , suddenly &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; make you out of the author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know , you can do it , you need to be a teacher to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the Sum@@ men feel , and knows how the Sum@@ men feel , and knows how the Sum@@ men knew , who is the Sum@@ men , who is it ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
I &apos;m still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then , my &quot; &quot; South states @-@ Kell@@ ner &quot; &quot; was a question . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way to outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ um , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I will say no , when I say two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; firstly , I must say to say , and secondly , they called me not . &quot;
&quot; no one is no longer &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I wo@@ ke up when I came to Titan , and my Sum@@ men prayed , and here , all of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; m@@ um , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; I say , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh much , and I will find much more dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is excellent because my pain and my pan@@ ics , in the im@@ itation , and in the absence of the sum@@ mer@@ ing , I can do nothing . &quot;
I am focused .

a ment@@ oring door goes on and a energy rise comes .

the sum@@ men comes slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly any , it is quiet , but it is quiet , but it is here . &quot;
&quot; not the Sum@@ men , but a Sum@@ men . &quot;

what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ men came back in my leisure . the sum@@ men seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without play .
&quot; it needs time , but after a few months a door opens up a door , the energy flow , and I find myself in my office . I use it to new ideas . I use it to new ideas and love my work . &quot;
&quot; I like the Sum@@ men , but I love it . &quot;
I need it .
&quot; I am not the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men are not ... not anymore . &quot;
&quot; dinner with friends , dinner , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my Sum@@ men .
the sum@@ men of life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
&quot; the sum@@ men of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I have never seen a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to less work and to play more . &quot;
and yet I have to burn everything in grip . my brain is still working . my camp fire is still working .
&quot; the more I play , the lucky are I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;

&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ chir@@ ur@@ rection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I need to do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organic , a very low ability to self @-@ determination . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a serious , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I am functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgery ?
a physician who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical measures .
&quot; on the other hand , they have one of the most famous one of the most famous one of the most famous forms of the brain , in order to influence the schem@@ atic of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves the neuro@@ logical function . &quot;
&quot; it is really a amazing technology . it has improved the destiny of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , which is under severe cit@@ rus and heavy pain . &quot;
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
my opinion of my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with something help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began before 15 years ago .
at the time I was a conduc@@ tivity and worked day and night in the emergency room .
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 2,0@@ 57 257 &quot;
&quot; they have to imagine that at the shafts of the brain tum@@ ors , the brain tum@@ ours and the shafts pressure . &quot;
&quot; to save the life , you need to reduce the shafts pressure . &quot;
you need to remove a part of your brain mass .
&quot; instead of the pure brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells from an or@@ phan@@ ed piece is comparable to very small children that will be taken out of your families .
&quot; you need to find the correct nutrition , temperature , moisture and the environments to allow them to do it . &quot;
this is exactly what we do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François . &quot;
he looked under his micro@@ sk@@ op .
this was a huge surprise .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell . with great green cells , which is surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you do not know from the bi@@ ologists that stem cells are un@@ rip@@ e cells which can turn into every cell type of organism .
&quot; the adult brain has a stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nav@@ el of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising that this type of stem cells from the surface treatment of brain tissue in the skin .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are un@@ ster@@ ous .
&quot; but these cells kept it differently . &quot;
they came slowly and after a few weeks , they even were even killed . &quot;
&quot; we saw a new , strange cell population which saw as a stem cell , but had to be different . &quot;
we arrived long to understand where they came .
they origin@@ ate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot sex @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make a 4 % of our large @-@ life cycle cells .
you are playing a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the F@@ ö@@ tus , they provide them for the removal of the brain . &quot;
but why did they stay us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that it is part of the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to the brain . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
&quot; one thing is clearly clearly -- from these cells , we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we stand before a potential cell source , the brain makes it possible . &quot;
we had to prove it .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
&quot; we wanted to have a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area , and then the cells are precisely as cultiv@@ ating as it Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they then select color to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we read them at the exceptional location of its individu@@ ality . &quot;
© Warner Bros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we happen these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we happen to the same cells in excess brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ge , we could work with mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we passed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that they were completely lost after some weeks , they will go back home . the space is already occupied , they will disappear there . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we had a violation of the same cells and now remained the same cells , and came the cells to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe from the micro@@ sk@@ op .
these are the cells which were rei@@ m@@ pl@@ ine .
&quot; the evidence that they show , these small points are the cells which we are in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
here we could not stop at the moment .
help these cells also help to recover these cells as a mon@@ keys to recover from a brain ?

they had to feed the p@@ ellets from a tray .
they did very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable history level , we had reached the mot@@ mot@@ els in mot@@ mot@@ eur area . &quot;
&quot; then the mon@@ ks , they were able to move their hand , they were able to move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just like it would happen , relaxing it up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
patients are allergic and then try to pick a certain degree as well as in mon@@ keys .
&quot; as we are sure we had reached the degree of spontaneous recovery , which had its own cells to its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side they see the mon@@ keys , which was opened . &quot;
it can be about 40 % to 50 % of its original capacity of violation of violation .
it is not so precise and not so quickly .
&quot; you can see , when we see the cells out of the cells : the same thing , two months after surgery . &quot;
I can say that they were very exciting results for us very exciting results .
&quot; since this time , we have found much more about this cells . &quot;

&quot; in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still always to get rid of them at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope that I can show you how the human brain is to heal himself .
thank you .

&quot; of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are , before you begin clinical studies on people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is comprehen@@ sible , the brain is very del@@ ist@@ ed , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission for the start of clinical trials .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
&quot; at first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select the treatment and assess whether it is useful to make these kinds of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to use a multi@@ centralized study . &quot;
you must first really consider that it is useful if you can offer this treatment .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at Scub@@ astore and that you have told us about it . &quot;

democracy .
&quot; in the west , we make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; we see the democracy not as the broken plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as an un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive feelings .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great night in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a blos@@ som@@ ing capitalism and impressive growth during the policy of completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , the democracy lies in us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece re@@ presented the newly chosen Greek government -- the newly chosen Greek government -- our elections -- our elections -- our elections -- not the austerity measures that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in this moment I thought that there could not be a better right production for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my dis@@ cour@@ aged friends that would say that democracy would be a change if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to imagine an economical model for a real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I am trying to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , we could save the democracy , but that we may need a true and democratic democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies become one of our future generations , and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Horny@@ Laura is on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin apples @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known for you . you know and recognize him as the debt , who brought his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
but only a few can recognize his purpose .
&quot; for example , a mountain from un@@ protected cash that would have to invest in it there , where it would be productive , where it would be productive and income , which could cause productive and income , which could cause productive , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby Food market ; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 3.1 Ambi@@ ent Fish and Seafood Market Volume ( Kg m ) and Growth ( Y @-@ o @-@ Y ) , 2007 @-@ 17 &quot;
&quot; as a result , debts and un@@ productive capital is not equal , which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are St@@ ag@@ ni@@ est wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low investment demand that could not invest in them . &quot;
&quot; un@@ spo@@ iled , the circumstances leads to that a body is thi@@ cker . &quot;
this is my hatred with the capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , human talents , and especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is that democracy is the solution ?
I don &apos;t think about it . but before we continue in democracy : what do we understand among democracy ?
ari@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form of the order and the poor as the majority of the government .
page has moved Click here ...
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the importance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to this out@@ lines . &quot;
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it was the working poor and not only the right to free expression .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not held long ago .
&quot; like a candle , the very bright light , it is also burned quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democ@@ rati@@ zation does not exist in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the smooth Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; during the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy , the liberal democracy is based on the free citizens and the working poor , is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a sentence for the interests of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only on , as a full separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of politics was possible , while the economy -- the world of the concert -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present countries , since the time , the separation of politics and economy began , an unbe@@ ar@@ able struggle between the two instead by the economy . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
it is not a de@@ hydr@@ ation of its DNA .
&quot; it is in fact that one can be in the government , and still not at power , because the power of politics in economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred in capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about such as a herd of pre@@ cip@@ itation , who has nour@@ ished the animals , from which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are hungry at the end of the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the policy as far as far as far as far as far as possible . the power of the corporations are growing , political parties and the managing director of the corporations are to invest in cash to invest in cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism the &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from the democracy , the higher will be the purpose of human labor power and the well @-@ being of human labour power and the well @-@ being of hum@@ ank@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control reserves , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of the slaves , women and the foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
&quot; the mar@@ x@@ al left , this idea was already 100 years ago , and it went well out . &quot;
&quot; the doctrine from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be to create a position as in ancient Athens , without new types of bro@@ od and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : the working poor !
&quot; capitalism does it , by means of a long @-@ term reduction of automation and robots . &quot;
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics have separate areas , the automation of the twin apples and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we have to build the economy and politics , and the areas of economy and politics , so that we will continue the re@@ main@@ der of the democratic country , otherwise we have to appear in a disease @-@ based surveillance bureaucracy , the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , is not whether the capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which it will survive . &quot;
&quot; most interesting question is whether the capitalism is in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ale &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations with the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; how could it happen , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene ? &quot;
&quot; in the practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of the company : imagine a capital market in which you deserve money , while you &apos;re working on a work point for the next , and the company -- no matter what you are just working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; all income from capital , and the concept of labour work is completely revised . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they are not part of the work , and employees who work there where the company does not belong to the company , but there is no need to go out between investment and labour , and ultimately it does not mean that there is no need for us . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : make sure that our national currencies have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; they continue to say that the entire world trade in this currency , we call them &quot; &quot; the universe &quot; , &quot; in units from &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government will pay the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading income of the respective country . &quot;
&quot; whether this fund in &quot; green &quot; technologies are invested in parts of the world , especially in parts of the world , in which investment activities are available . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the board on W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that one was not the technical means .
&quot; today , we have them , especially before the background of a re@@ organized politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I say is , at the same time , the liberal business , in which they preferred privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ ingly because they have to dig the separation of capital and work in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer history of history , and the highlight of the key@@ nes@@ i@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we be used in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ pres@@ ets ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide themselves .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .

&quot; through the transmission of this crisis on the next , as we have currently experiencing it , it is not only our democ@@ rati@@ fication , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis occurs , it is also relevant to Marx , Marx and Marx . &quot;
&quot; as soon as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal trial , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally wrong . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are able to see it . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you do not have enough to do it enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , Einstein , who said . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal democ@@ rati@@ zation , we have given the direction of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics while the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , when I say that this is prov@@ oked , similar to China today the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- we tend to connect the Liber@@ alism with democracy , which is a mistake , historically , historically . &quot;
&quot; Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , such as John Stu@@ art Mill , &quot;
&quot; it was especially scep@@ tically , what the democratic development is concerned . &quot;
&quot; what you can now observe in China , in the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second . &quot;
&quot; China is now working to do what the West in the 19th century , it has been done to hypo@@ cris@@ y after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many years are curious about your experiences as financial crisis of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I believe that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you see six months later on the first half of the first half ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , for we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; from the self @-@ determination to say , and the continuation of the den@@ om@@ ination of the euro@@ zone was threatened by the euro@@ zone and continues to keep the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek translation -- the way , the first proposal , who was given the den@@ ial of this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to get an economic system that is not over@@ being able , it will probably be able to do a while , but if the change of change happens , it &apos;s impossible and destructive . &quot;
BG : what is the change of change ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone does not have the future when we do not change their construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a financial crisis ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously , seriously ... &quot;
&quot; if it has a finance minister , or any ministers , who claimed after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he doesn &apos;t have a mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .

I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the money they gave a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they wanted to do our government , only because they wanted to deal with the distribution of the euro@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; they did not pass away , that they had a catastro@@ phic program since 5 years . &quot;
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; there is worse than the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the money , which has imposed us this policy , was said : &quot; that was a col@@ t error . &quot;
&quot; Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view : Friday , November 14 , 2016 At 15 : 00 &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from something that lives and loves .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not live .
&quot; for when they did not live , the chief apostle forces will destroy his son and the European Union . &quot;
this is not alone alone for Europe catastro@@ phic consequences but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy of the world .
&quot; when we beat ourselves on the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be well toler@@ ated for the future of Europeans like the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , many thanks for you . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price have never heard , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 medium @-@ minute of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision which had met Roy before three years .
Roy Price is a leader in Amazon studios
your email address will not be published . required fields are marked *
&quot; on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and the contents of the Amazon .
&quot; of course , it is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select anywhere .
you have to find shows that are very good .
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the application distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website , and the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review . &quot;
powered by Alp@@ ha@@ Content 4.0@@ .@@ 18 © 2005 @-@ 2015 - All rights reserved
then one has a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; &quot; live Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make a thing after you have one thing , your brain asks : &quot; where there &apos;s more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ les and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should you tell you what is going on this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price does not work on the left side of the curve because I think you need a particular intelligence to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ les and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;

so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon will be nothing ris@@ ky . &quot;
he wants to create success .

&quot; there are many ideas for TV shows and select a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents it online , where they can see each free of charge . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 1 ) 2,0@@ 57 257 &quot;
millions of spectators watch this episode .
&quot; however , they do not know that they will be observed during the look of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team .
&quot; by Andrzej On September 23 , 2012 &quot;
collect millions of data to decide with these data then to decide which show them are .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this is the answer , and this is the answer : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four nuclear weapons . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not so many to this show , because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show in the sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 , and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- is something about the average , but not just that Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always looking at looking for a super @-@ show and he uses data for it , but it makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of a competition , he moved and his team to identify the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings which they may show the shows that shows they may like etc . &quot;

&quot; as they had all the parts together , they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four mu@@ ators , but a drama series on a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two staff . &quot;
&quot; the House of Cards &quot; get a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve , so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question : what is happening here ? &quot;

&quot; they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
how is this ?
&quot; because the logic might seem to work in particular , it should work in everything . &quot;
&quot; if you want to collect millions of data , for a decision you should go , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
- Save time and money with the readily accessible key market data included in the report .
you can optimized it through very powerful computer .
&quot; what to expect , what you can expect , is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis do not work , it is something sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health system ?
nobody . OK that is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in touch with this software comes into contact with this software .
&quot; if anyone here in the USA in prison , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead to decide whether a show is good or bad , will be decided if a person is good or bad . &quot;
there are no events scheduled during this period .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
not always the best results . this is not to know that a company such as Multi @-@ Health System does not know how to use the data .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; yes , even Google makes it sometimes errors . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
it was fantastic and was a great news . the success gi@@ fted in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked well , year to year to year , until it was no longer functional , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; not only , this was again a sensor , including the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all of these mistakes , this error occurred in decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in the legal approach , in medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
I know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ supported gene@@ tics -- a field where some very wise people do not require a lot of data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be widespread .
&quot; need a complex problem , do you do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; as a return , you can analyze this problem into its details so that you can analyze the items ; as a double @-@ set the items you will be able to create a connection . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby Food market ; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts back again and then to a discharge .
there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something else , when the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when it is the brain of a experts . &quot;
&quot; for example , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they are able to use data and understanding where they are also involved in the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to understand their audience better than they would not have been able to understand , but the decision to take all these parts , and it is not the show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that they went a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; however , this is the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they were useless data to control all their decisions , first than they were looking for TV ideas , then as they were &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could say , &quot; &quot; that tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things will begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby Food market ; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; &quot;
your email address will not be published . required fields are marked *
&quot; before it was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ or No question you &apos;ll need to get a ball to get a answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
&quot; I have seen some decisions in my life , but I should listen to the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but how you know of course if you have the data , you would like to replace the data in order to make better decisions . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not the base of the basic building . &quot;
&quot; finally , perhaps the ball @-@ sophisticated and sophisticated and sophisticated and sophisticated . ultimately , it is to make decisions when we want something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I am able to find this as very encouraging news that there is no need to make decisions to be a expert in which you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you are at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
