<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">"they know him, because he won as a New York Times-Times the Pulitzer Prize."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen a book, in which he heard a book, in which he heard a book in which he heard the NSA acts by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a remaining impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence officer, in which the CIA was literally substituted for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"by Andrzej On November 2, 2012"</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know how the chapter isn't done?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government was established against Risen and asked to call its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he was the symbol for the sample of the government, Whistlebell was asked to condemn the journalist and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right to use this right if media will not get information, and if they can't protect the identity of the mute."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government in Risen climbed, he did something about what many muenists already did before him: he refused, and said that he would go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, only days before the process, pastimes something different."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were years of years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were killed."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide less less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of moving and Risen to the statements, you may also need his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, the investigators, without his understanding, his phone call is concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as such as its e-mail data, financial and credit information, financial and bank information, its credit rating, and even travel information with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they were useless in order to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-Whistlebate and Risens the general source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama said on his departure, Whistlebowski himself. but instead he has condemned the justice to him as all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government too much of their work."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since the 11th of September, almost every article about national security was the result of that a Whistlebell was going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we also set the press work on the game, which will be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government is always more opportunities to inform you all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but as the technology of government allowed to handle the rights of replication, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"at the moment, they can take it from the moment when they turn to contact, instead of return."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that had not been written, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is securex, an open source-source code system for Whistlebell, which was developed by the people of the Press Foundation, which was developed by us of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I work, was developed."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of an e-mail, go to a News website, as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"if you want to send documents or information, such as with each individual form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"this will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which has access to the relevant news agency."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for example, the government does not have more information such information, and many of the information that it would not be available from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments are becoming increasingly interested in the world over the world."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to ensure that not only technology practices such as Edward Snowden has an opportunity to protect iniquity. it is just important that we protect the next step-care,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"at the end of the last few years, the United States and the United States will continue to take part in the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"all these technologies were not only for those who wish to cover the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>

<seg id="939">"during the athenic democracy, the liberal democracy is based on the free citizens and the working poor, is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a sentence for the interests of the Magna Carta."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only on, as a full separation of politics and economy, and the democratic process of politics was possible, while the economy -- the world of the concert -- a democratic zone."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it is in fact that one can be in the government, and still not at power, because the power of politics in economy and the areas are separated."</seg>

<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy again, and it would be better if the" "demos" control reserves, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of the slaves, women and the foreigners. "</seg>

<seg id="961">"in the practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>

<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not part of the work, and employees who work there where the company does not belong to the company, but there is no need to go out between investment and labour, and ultimately it does not mean that there is no need for us."</seg>

<seg id="966">"they continue to say that the entire world trade in this currency, we call them" "the universe", "in units from" Cosmos "-- and any government will pay the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading income of the respective country."</seg>
<seg id="967">"whether this fund in" green "technologies are invested in parts of the world, especially in parts of the world, in which investment activities are available."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the board on Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>

<seg id="972">"the world that I say is, at the same time, the liberal business, in which they preferred privileged persons, and marxingly because they have to dig the separation of capital and work in the Mülleimer history of history, and the highlight of the keynesification."</seg>

<seg id="1105">"* Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands; * Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop."</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all of these mistakes, this error occurred in decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in the legal approach, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-supported genetics -- a field where some very wise people do not require a lot of data to make serious decisions like the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be widespread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"need a complex problem, do you do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a return, you can analyze this problem into its details so that you can analyze the items; as a double-set the items you will be able to create a connection."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby Food market; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change; * Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands;"</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts back again and then to a discharge.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something else, when the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of a experts."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"for example, I think it was Netflix so successful because they are able to use data and understanding where they are also involved in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to understand their audience better than they would not have been able to understand, but the decision to take all these parts, and it is not the show as" House of Cards "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that they went a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"however, this is the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they were useless data to control all their decisions, first than they were looking for TV ideas, then as they were" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could say," "that tell us the data." ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things will begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"data coverage: market sizes (historic and forecasts), company shares, brand shares and distribution data. why buy this report? * Get a detailed picture of the Baby Food market; * Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change; * Understand the competitive environment, the market's major players and leading brands;"</seg>

<seg id="1128">"before it was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaor No question you'll need to get a ball to get a answer." "most likely" -- exactly here in this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">Here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have seen some decisions in my life, but I should listen to the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but how you know of course if you have the data, you would like to replace the data in order to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"however, this is not the base of the basic building."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"finally, perhaps the ball-sophisticated and sophisticated and sophisticated and sophisticated. ultimately, it is to make decisions when we want something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I am able to find this as very encouraging news that there is no need to make decisions to be a expert in which you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you are at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
