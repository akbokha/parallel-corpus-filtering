the saf@@ est characters of a regime exchange is it when they begin to att@@ aching the statues .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did , when he did a symbolic attack with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by Jim A@@ co@@ sta by Jim A@@ co@@ sta by Jim A@@ co@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller handle not the statue itself . &quot;
a Hor@@ de of Boat rental and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators could have done it when he had done it .
&quot; but he ple@@ aded their importance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , as the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the mind , his base was added . &quot;
&quot; Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that are in the world . &quot;
the poem that was added later was added and not part of the original case .
&quot; Miller doesn &apos;t really right , but as he is able to form@@ ulate it , it is not really a story . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance images of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only need any old immigrants , but the anger of the poor : &quot; &quot; your poor , your arms , / your be@@ holding of the masses , and to breathe freely , and the el@@ event@@ ual waste of your rich cows . &quot;
there was never a time to see in the &quot; el@@ event@@ ful waste &quot; on our screens .
Miller &apos;s not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome .
&quot; this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural education : it is indeed a conflict in fact a conflict around the importance of America . &quot;
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sought to place their words according to their death at the base - were very good that they were a highly political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ ism , by making them in an ab@@ used classical representation of the freedom . &quot;
Laz@@ arus have changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
and she is a completely different name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Laz@@ arus was the importance of the statue , the people wanted to switch the people from right wing to the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great cry as R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of T@@ äu@@ er for the com@@ men of Tr@@ ump , argue that the imprisonment of Tr@@ ump , argue that the US Flam@@ me was put in the world , but rather a early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American Flam@@ me to the world : &quot; &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
you should also use the F@@ ack@@ el of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el is not the way in the United States .
from the last 60 days from the last 365 days from any date Status closed
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; from Laz@@ arus was in it to see them as they saw from the er@@ ectile , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terri@@ fying travels to the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who are looking for a chance to improve their lives and a chance to improve their lives .
&quot; their statue says to them the words of hope and the Almighty , which they listen to them . &quot;
and this is of course not the perspective of Miller and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; they don &apos;t know the way of the way , but the hatred , who is the only source of power , infl@@ amed the only source of power . &quot;

&quot; the Mann@@ ers in says that they are &quot; &quot; proud of &quot; &quot; the fact that many of their land was not only the team , but in some cases the med@@ als are also involved in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of Team Members is that they have chosen from the other members of the team , so that there is a great honor for me , but you have chosen to have a very special for me . &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very proud of all the shame that belong to the team . &quot;

the father of our country knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it took a long time to the newspapers of him , from the inner policy to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; by Andrzej On February 5 , 2011 &quot;
but he has not brought his death not to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; the freedom can be taken away - and , du@@ mm and mu@@ m we will be led like the sheep . &quot;

&quot; H@@ og@@ ans collabor@@ ates with the contributions of at least 450 persons , and will be deleted by their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , it was the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the law@@ suit was ra@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ action with &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a French Gou@@ sh@@ ne@@ ur in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two th@@ ron@@ ed consent of the 50 Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ sts of the nation .
H@@ ogan Lov@@ ells Firm of the Year for Restru@@ cturing and Corporate Rescue
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict regulations of principles .
&quot; he was also very happy to use Facebook as pri@@ z@@ res means to connect with his voters and experienced his ha@@ iry head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block of persons who come to the side of the Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ urs - the public forum is to be paid by employees who pay with public tax dollars - un@@ needed and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in a interview with The Washington Post sent H@@ og@@ ans Spre@@ aders in Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse , the actions of Gou@@ ne@@ ne@@ urs , and argued that the block@@ ers of the comments are nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;

&quot; this post was edited 1 times , last edit by &quot; &quot; Illustr@@ ation@@ ie &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;

they all said that their comments are resp@@ ect@@ ful and not prof@@ ited .

&quot; I believe that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ le@@ break and other current News , &quot; she wrote in the comment@@ ator area of the post . &quot;
&quot; this idea also does not mean when a number of people to the same topic , they will be used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective bar@@ gaining , and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;

&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hoch@@ land of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which should be held in 1969 as just 1,0@@ 26 years before the occup@@ ying guns . &quot;
&quot; a existing movement , which led to the independence of the Dutch rule , turned back to the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds the control over the region and foreign journalists or legal regulations . &quot;

&quot; as it represents , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared the mor@@ nings , and closed it out of an interview report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a short run between the state and local criminal prosecution , not only on the mor@@ als , evidence of evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks don &apos;t need a pre @-@ appearance .
&quot; it was a election of the mass@@ acre , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne , because we don &apos;t talk about it , &quot; &quot; said she , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;

&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are quite constant , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases , in which the person is considered as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers over his age . &quot;

this is a sealed mount which is used as a operating way .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meters width will be used . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the pedestrian cycle was lost . &quot;

as the financial rules of the foot of the foot of the N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris ?
&quot; the rules , the aim of the aim , to prevent the budget of the European football club , N@@ ey@@ eb@@ s world @-@ transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will be monitored for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , for the conduc@@ tive organisation , the European game monitored the power , nation@@ als from the access to the pres@@ tige Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which have been called by UEF@@ A &apos;s life , mean that PS@@ G will have to show that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar could be financed without large losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has 49 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary for several ten million dollars per year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money into a gal@@ ax@@ y , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and put him into a gal@@ ax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich family of Kat@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may need to use a lot of money , but with legitimate sources , but with legitimate sources that enable them to the break @-@ up of the football business . &quot;
the FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken advantage of their success after success , effectively , effectively and dis@@ cour@@ aged , when banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P from the concentration on the concentration of the clubs are on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich , published 2003 in Chelsea , a club with potential bought and then proven to build a global brand - a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ end period , the period until 2018 is running until 2018 , clubs can take place in height of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 from the Presi@@ dency of Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ aps continue to be taken into account of excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; the FF@@ P is not dead , and we will still get the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the future , compared to The Associated Press in the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it is paid for the amount for the invo@@ ices over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years , for the next five years of EUR 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; the PS@@ G was reduced by 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which had been reduced to 20 million Euro for the Champions League &apos;s season 2014 / 15 to 21 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that try to over@@ see their financial support by companies that are connected with the owners of a clubs , burning . &quot;
&quot; during a Catal@@ ar@@ an enterprise , the PS@@ G could not exceed the value of the sponsor@@ ings , if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should not exceed the UEF@@ A this is not considered as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PS@@ A from the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
&quot; it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar wrote on payments of the organizational committees of the WM 2022 in Kat@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have told that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be said , and a new man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regulation authorities might be out . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the UEF@@ A will mean that the UEF@@ A still will be able to notice any attempt to use the rules to handle the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory conversations with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said they were under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not be@@ et@@ ched to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 5@@ 2.4 million euros invested a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year will be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing companies , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ express . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the Spanish League was clear to see one of the best football players to see , and they tried to prevent the N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Newspaper AS in accordance with Kat@@ ar the property owner of PS@@ G . &quot;

&quot; in the last year , the Supreme Court had confirmed by the Supreme Court for the Pre@@ p to pay for the Pre@@ p in spite of the claims that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;

studies have shown that Pre@@ p the HIV transfer of HIV infection is significantly reduced significantly .
Pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that there is enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .

&quot; the big life live : the mezzanine and clever Designer tricks , this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment was transformed into a generous home . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ note with a passion for real estate , in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne have not been packed and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my Ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I sought after something that was comparable to my prize .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
&quot; I have made myself in love with love , and for this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely revised since the first visit . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room estate with a welded layout - you had to get to the kitchen , to get into the bedroom , to get into the bedroom and to use the spacious ceiling height to use the spacious ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , much light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ asmus Hill , the 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home , which is not only one development , but also a place for yo@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms of each other , that the architectural challenge is to create an interim element in which you could stand . &quot;
the idea was to be creative in order to solve the execution .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were covered with each other , without having seen ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about to build a simple platform , but the steel so that it was necessary for the function above or down the right height . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the meantime , a classic copper wire windows of the rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area down to the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; round Murano Glass Beads , Silver Foil , Ca d@@ Oro , 8mm , Aqua &quot;
&quot; the use of Spi@@ ke plays a role in adding theatres , space and light . &quot;
on both ends it is a short cor@@ ridor to allow him longer to leave him longer .
in the kitchen it feels like a window into another room .
&quot; on the entrance offer the pi@@ eb@@ ble units , for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ er smo@@ kes , the beauty of the living room is able to close the kitchen when they are not used . &quot;
together with fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special emphasis on this is that it is a garage doors .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in &quot; , &quot; explained by the steel , the MDF door of the MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important that it is important if you push the door open , very easy gl@@ amor@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground floor - or as your property is estimated , &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary shape , a real estate consultant , and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here it is possible to use the floor space to enlarge and at the same time quality materials , which provide space with its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch , and therefore help to create a emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ asmus . &quot;
you do not have your electric plug in the walls of the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your hearts . &quot;
it shows that a apartment is characterized by good design and improved square number of something different in something very useful .
&quot; indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you may decide to leave this not . &quot;

&quot; two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family the Dy@@ nasty , founded in a discussion due to one of the biggest real estate agencies Vict@@ ori@@ as in the value of over 500 million dollars . &quot;

&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the city center , the development of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; after a agreement with her dead father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family of De Lu@@ tis - about two thir@@ ds of the company and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court ruled that this means that col@@ in property was established in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul at the value of 176 million dollars .

&quot; when cann@@ at Tr@@ ump of Tr@@ ump was to be productive , it was productive to convince him that he was a fa@@ ire reporting of jobs that were to convince him to convince him to convince him to convince in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos &apos;s pal@@ mer@@ i wrote on the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keep me in the control of control , according to six former Soviet authorities , it is possible to ensure that his personal media is a constant concern . &quot;
thank you very much .

&quot; when it comes to his employees , some times they have gone out for him , then they have started their efforts . &quot;
&quot; no one has to prevent it , but no one has to prevent Tr@@ ump Kon@@ tro@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , which will always try to bring their own agenda , by Tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very with this story - told in May about the preference of the advis@@ er , President of strategic reasons . &quot;
this was an example that was described by Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher was described :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcan@@ o can react to negative press , especially those with damaged lo@@ ids , and that he would be able to find out where these were come . &quot;
&quot; exactly that the end of February , when someone said to the President b@@ ös@@ s a printed copy of a article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C.

&quot; although Johnson due to che@@ que permanently made from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence or that he has made false witness to the past in the past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;

&quot; in the autumn 2014 , a dramatic growth of refugees who came into the district , the hotel building was offered as a trading room , which was established in the country . &quot;
&quot; the city rec@@ alls the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers through the list of a building plan , in order to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the community . &quot;
&quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt is responsible for the mayor of Os@@ sw@@ ald , and said , at that time , at the beginning of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should be right .

&quot; the floors were carved out , blank@@ ets to a part of the living room , old people from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; to March , there are still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a beautiful place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black @-@ country style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large heated showers , the input area is designed , it will be installed in new window . &quot;
&quot; everything should be called &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; as the Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
we want to make a jewelry piece .
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , however , it is already a big city centre @-@ level , empha@@ sizing Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms , wide @-@ wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
both individuals and business people will feel comfortable in the hotel .
&quot; conversations with OB / Os@@ sw@@ ald and Tourism Director Michael Krause , he has already led to Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the idea of the city were covered with those of the hotel group .
we are on the same line .
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not responsible for the amount of investments . &quot;
&quot; more than one million Euro , it pays off . &quot;
&quot; even the outside facilities are brought up to front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a patio , a large terrace that is accessible from the restaurant , the public is accessible . &quot;

Italy conduc@@ ts the tone of NGO to NGO Rescue Rescue
&quot; at the same time , NGOs will not have to continue their rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they may not continue to continue their rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if you want to write a new Code of Code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities , a boat of the German aid organisation called &quot; youth rescue &quot; &quot; had been working with human rights in a way that could lead the illegal immigrants in a way . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year in operation , it is possible to provide detailed guidance of Italian citizenship ( Amb@@ ro@@ gio Go@@ sio ) . &quot;
&quot; for us is and remains the salvation of the human life , our top priority . it does so that we can &apos;t work in the search and rescue area , &quot; said the organization in a position to the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all accounts that are collected , after we have collected all information collected and asked the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is advisable that his crew will be delivered on board , which can be delivered directly from the human body , and that the ships can be used directly from the human body , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the government &apos;s government , their content of Italian media was published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation will be informed about the authority of Italian coast , the rescue operation in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Code , boats would have to have boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , especially a Italian police officer , which are monitored by their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs , who have involved in search and rescue operations are ready to hold on the code : Save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules are considered unnecessary , but un@@ acceptable as they would not have any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel prize @-@ organization organization and doctors without limits ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who came to the rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal seas and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;

&quot; it was only a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was forced from two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times , because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with the twel@@ fth river . &quot;
&quot; in his car , his car went into his car , and damaged it near to his car . &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the topic of Val@@ dez is practically nothing than silence .
&quot; in the past year , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become the last year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become a blu@@ epr@@ ints to fill the vacuum to fill out the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the streets , or that the cemetery is full of thick , two @-@ storey de@@ vil@@ s for drugs , the greater than many houses for the liver . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; silence &quot; if only a met@@ aph@@ or control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs policy in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez is aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings to the murder .

&quot; this publication may be delivered to the members of the members of the members , every member of the edition will be delivered as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second error was in it , Val@@ dez did not force up to force , according to the circum@@ stance of a other newspaper , the same history , had to leave the country to his own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had so long he lives for his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 , he was founded in 2003 and was sold in 2003 , as he worked with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and 50 US dollars . &quot;

&quot; with the time , the newspaper was a call for the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the author were fascin@@ ated by a publication , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by an publication in which they could read stories that no one else could . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the pres@@ tige &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what hast thou done so many of him ... why did you not say what was going before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed in Val@@ dez , the daughter of a friend , who knew how a port workers were killed , the friend who knew the generous and counsel of counsel , a teacher , who knew how to over@@ see . &quot;
they are familiar with his routine .

&quot; he would always be able to sit in El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite from the office , and there are always at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them , &quot; &quot; was his love for routine ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced them to put their own plans in question , as they can remain in the best . &quot;
&quot; they may not be aware of their children , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing lines &quot; to move drugs . &quot;

&quot; we spent the next six years , the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only believe a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has been s@@ worn , &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at Royal Ty@@ r@@ re@@ ll Museum in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ re@@ ll Museum . &quot;
&quot; it is known as one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ os@@ ks - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ os@@ ks . &quot;

&quot; they covered the con@@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defense method in the animal , which means that the top of the cre@@ ole was darker than their bottom . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ sh@@ ady is usually common , the results appear as the size of B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , which rises above all the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the Din@@ osau@@ rs of enough pressure through the flesh , Din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the deteri@@ oration of the confron@@ tation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; most contemporary animals , who use the con@@ sh@@ aded - think of R@@ ust , zeb@@ ras or belt - are much smaller and un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive as prey ; what is sign@@ alized to survival that the point of survival in a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong mid@@ day behaviour on a massive , strong bre@@ asts of Din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the Din@@ osau@@ rs can have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sk@@ aters also shows that the skin of the Din@@ os@@ ks are red brown . &quot;
&quot; scientists examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his con@@ stric@@ tor , to find out what it is than his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the Din@@ os@@ ks he died when he died in a river , and in the sea , where he was in the sea to the sea . &quot;
&quot; for this time , Alber@@ ta was so warm like South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and Oc@@ eans probably have much more agricultural than they are today . &quot;
&quot; it is really remarkable , because it is completely with con@@ ical skin , but also in three dimensions and the original shape of the animal feed , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today is almost as just as in the early stages .
&quot; if you don &apos;t need a lot to use it to re@@ construct it , if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes , you could believe that he is on stroke . &quot;
&quot; the circle was a time as a huge thermal di@@ odes , the din@@ osau@@ r Din@@ osau@@ r who were on two legs , the earth . &quot;

&quot; the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings in the trade unions appear , believe that B@@ ore@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta after the death in the sea , and in the Schl@@ um@@ i@@ um@@ i@@ um@@ i@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the Kre@@ ation was found in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the be@@ asts of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is completely covered by sn@@ ail up to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were in average approx . 18 feet ( 5 metres ) long and have up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
there are two 20 inches long @-@ long points that were drawn from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ cre@@ sts have been floo@@ ded by the Western Canada up to an over@@ floo@@ ding river in the open sea .
&quot; but the underwater refund of the Din@@ osau@@ rs , his arm@@ rest in exquisite item details . &quot;
&quot; the remains of this special feature are so good that the Hau@@ tre@@ ks always have a hol@@ ocaust tank plates along the Din@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , it is a great level of preservation such as such as a profit . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it before , the conf@@ using it . &quot;
the remn@@ ants of the skin can still cover the hol@@ ocaust tank plates that carry the shafts of the animal .

he had a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ ashed body which would remain on the road and there were four hours .
&quot; that is a wild , thought of Fer@@ re@@ ll . &quot;
but death was nothing new .
you put her mobile phone to return later on the evening at the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos of police and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed his father , and said , &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just turned my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
they watched a live feed at a group of demonstr@@ ators with a b@@ ell@@ ous dog .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not quite common , remember Fer@@ re@@ ll to her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder to which we have used to us and we call it typical .
in this moment I felt bulk .
I was angry and w@@ ept .
you took a return and went on the next day .
&quot; after the land of 23 PM , she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two in the next morning after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ re@@ ll and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on passive , the topic of a new documentary film , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , the love and loss , the strength and resistance , the strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and the streets to call answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ re@@ ll with her daughter , a cau@@ dal and a suitable crown of her daughter , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , took the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I have taught you , when black people have to fight , they believe they ? &quot; remember them , what they said . &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police took a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take it , said Fer@@ re@@ ll later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what is happening in the past .
you must know it and see it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only assets and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to be free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have lucky enough to give her a experience in which she was personally experienced , she is not different than the next black women @-@ child . &quot;
I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep it far from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , a place toward the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place toward the police , which was on the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
Fer@@ re@@ ll and her daughter are connected with a local business .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new type of assets for Fer@@ re@@ ll shape .
&quot; after the 9th of August , she said , she said that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association was concentrated on the essence of justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations . &quot;
I had no experience in the organizers .
it &apos;s all come .
&quot; later Fer@@ re@@ ll during a evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , a co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her camera am@@ ann Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted only to document what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ re@@ ll in the sense : &quot; &quot; you will be able to find a story to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this Sk@@ ep@@ sis has been created through countless cases of people , often from White - in a community , which led by their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up to their voices and we wanted to make it differently . &quot;
following his former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis had worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis .
his dedication brought to Fer@@ re@@ ll the project closer together with six other locals with six other locals .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks with us . we talk about , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be shown , for so I will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls of experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leaders , but in order to show a community that comes into the movement , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved itself as the open @-@ up in the film . &quot;
&quot; his personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ le &apos;s personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , as she is married and her wife married . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ re@@ ll and la@@ ims , when they saw the ready product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that it has to give it a certain risk of black people .
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ le history is the role of the black female women in the wider black @-@ light @-@ motion motion . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which according to the killing of the black teen@@ agers tra@@ y@@ from Martin in 2012 the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ Li@@ es@@ Matter &quot; &quot; in social media have identify itself as @-@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions took the movement of &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ re@@ ll , &quot; and therefore we are constantly on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women have to wear the main last of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that the movement really is kept in black women and many black women .
&quot; however , this means that &quot; this is not a sc@@ anned type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ re@@ ll due to their identity as the heart of the movie . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who said this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no chance , although she was on the front front , because when a man on this cross@@ roads are a black , hot woman so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen .
&quot; in the meantime , the news coverage of F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has disappeared , but the ra@@ dicals in the community and the police are still expected . &quot;
Fer@@ re@@ ll is on irrig@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to a demonstration at a demonstration in a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the social atmosphere of the area , which they called her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they feel like a song and they feel at this memory , since they went before three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight our freedom .
it is our duty to win our duty .
we have to love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains .

of which there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop stores here are empty - some since months and years .
&quot; if there are still a lot of weekly weekly market , it &apos;s more important to keep us at least the market hall . &quot;

&quot; a pity , special , there is no more and what it is still left , then will even disappear . &quot;

&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this is simply not work . &quot;
&quot; and a Shopping Center , which is empty , there is no one . &quot;
in my opinion it would have been better to support a real estate market instead of this gallery .
&quot; but for a peasant hall , it would be nice to tell many - how I find - sensu@@ al construction projects in bit@@ burg is no place more . &quot;
&quot; if the peas@@ antry will be made again , a piece of culture disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man gallery in New York , many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost identical - the cable ends of the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , which was created by Chelsea M@@ anning . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning sent out to the prison of Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth , where the former intelligence service provider has made a 35 @-@ year sentence of conscientious obj@@ ection to the site . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2nd August , A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ ump@@ tion ( A perfect simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has been transformed into technology , computer sciences and art . &quot;
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the Algorith@@ mic Analysis of DNA that has been created and created by M@@ anning Data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ significant determin@@ ism of this interpretation - but also for identity .
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as a Brad@@ ley Edward was spoken , but has been convic@@ ted for the identification of the identification of information as a woman , which was sentenced to 20 votes against the Sp@@ ion@@ age@@ law , computer and theft . &quot;
&quot; because of the prison was their image , so much that it was only one single photo - a grain , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which M@@ anning is clearly visible on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ gers &apos; .
&quot; in it produced the artist Por@@ celain of stran@@ ts from for@@ ens@@ ory art@@ ef@@ oot , chew@@ ing gum , and chew@@ ing gum , by making the DNA from the waste extracted to create a picture of them like these people look . &quot;

&quot; they led a interview with Chelsea M@@ anning , while it was in prison , and they wanted to accompany this article in order to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time , and they could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and their in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies were collected at the beginning of two years in the course of two years .
&quot; she created something of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o explains the &quot; &quot; Keywords Images &quot; , &quot; which would have to read a future in which the president would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; it was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings released after seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas , was a will@@ ful kind of lucky ones . &quot;
&quot; there are also now at the opening of the exhibition , something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump is going to find a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ vers@@ aries , to find new , powerful ways to go forward . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the Galerie , M@@ anning is called M@@ anning with her over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family names , whose basis of gender , breed , breed , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequ@@ encing - a cap@@ turing of Cs and G@@ s and As , in a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in this way , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ c@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , such as amazing , at least in biological , we all are all . &quot;
&quot; what man can hopefully be doing , who we are , and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works by 2007 , Sp@@ A Mem@@ ories , also to see . &quot;
DNA data can tell how many different stories tell us about the 30 of these stories .
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own room , is one page from the top of the comic No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
&quot; it shows M@@ anning , as it is in the hand of the disciplines from the disciplines of the United States , like king @-@ Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they make your speech cold , they won it . &quot;
&quot; so , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist that was out of Philadelphia . &quot;

&quot; M@@ anning , the exhibition still not seen in personally - as it should do in the Com@@ ic@@ book , but if they should do it in the center of the Mas@@ ks , from their own genom@@ ic simulation that can be found in the center of the mass@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which were written with a pencil with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had to feel at the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human amount , said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the por@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels with Chelsea , like the movement , which also behind its liberation . &quot;

&quot; N@@ CA@@ A is eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has extended its days - at least until the final Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the already complete schedules of players . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ promises away from two days is more than one day , in the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times during the summer school . &quot;

&quot; we put this enormous burden of three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have so simple , she pl@@ ush , and they are great people . &quot;
I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we will have more time it will really great .
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the Camp has ended , what was the end of the clear view of its fields from a adjacent car and the adjacent Lus@@ kin center , which is already filled with foot@@ b@@ bing class , which is already filled with foot@@ b@@ bing , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; share on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far back to think that people can rent a room and then set up a practice . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and of a exercise , it is a quite good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have the security forces there , and we have the security forces on the parking lot . &quot;
we will do the best to do what we have .
&quot; I am not too much worried . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan .

&quot; there is a record from a recording , which was 13@@ 80 in the Castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ des Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area , and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ?
&quot; other stories are feast in the history of the Castle , as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ its , the family of Dar@@ re@@ ll seven years long during the English Re@@ formation hidden . &quot;
&quot; the first century is shown in the second century , which made his own name , called Sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was only after years later , as his Sar@@ g was buried ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen are the gent@@ lemen , always up again and money for things that could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ re@@ ll &apos;s men do their school education , by making rich old women married - I call them to me as a dragon well with a talent to wer@@ in order . &quot;
after the end of his life in the castle is Rho@@ des on the search for other unique cry
&quot; it has a two @-@ week stay in Finnish Wil@@ derness for a comic book about E@@ vel@@ yn @-@ Roman , the area of a San@@ at@@ lan from the early 20th century , which was again returned from nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad , he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; oh , now I must go back to the life of life . &quot;

&quot; A@@ scen@@ sion of sex robots is real , and we should be worried about us . &quot;
&quot; just as you thought that there will not be any crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published on the development of sex robots ( foundation for responsible robot ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ ailed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to begin to take their climb seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingers . &quot;
&quot; the people don &apos;t know about them , but the companies deliver every lot of them , and we will continue to see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ acks have been developed by their infl@@ atable partners in robot@@ ics with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by the artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can adjust his robots according to his beliefs , and to create everything from the eye of the robot through the form of chest strap up to the type or color of his fingers . &quot;
&quot; but it will still be quiet because many robots are the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; who would look like a Step@@ ford lady . &quot;
modern rope ho@@ bs have developed a robot with a silicone surface .
&quot; the real Bot@@ ix robot makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties , which they are attractive to the properties such as birds . &quot;
&quot; and then , there &apos;s still the chance of True Religion , Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of mis@@ fortune and &quot; &quot; wild W@@ endy &quot; &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , the website of True Religion . &quot;
&quot; you may like what you like , and they may not like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , their offspring - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; they may be tired , on account or they can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many be@@ ef@@ ull aspects of this climb from sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships , but the lower female properties that are playing a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : hypo@@ critical ) Far@@ rah is going to be very quiet at most . &quot;
&quot; quote from : Philister on 09 . August 2015 , 17 : 19 : 23 PM &quot;
&quot; when women ( sic ) a vibr@@ ator , why don &apos;t have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; means it &apos;s on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just a different sex playing . &quot;
&quot; its creation and its increasing refin@@ ement in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of gender equality , to a desire for sex with under@@ tak@@ ers as optional . &quot;
&quot; however , most men are unable to keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R is their increasing popularity of popularity , they remain at the edge of the consumer . &quot;
&quot; but what from the boundary zones , however , can be seen in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very welcoming . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange , until they are the permission of the permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain extent that these high @-@ developed sex robots are threatened in a period of time , in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened in the White House a president who has developed the women of sex@@ ually attacked women . &quot;
&quot; the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical image , the sw@@ an body and the out@@ patient eyes , but as realistic as realistic . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gil@@ ead is a leap , but in the moment , this does not feel like a great deal . &quot;
the goal behind this sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to real women as well as technically possible ( even with por@@ no star @-@ propor@@ tions ) .
their realization that they want to feel human that they feel the movement of a real body .
&quot; however , on the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities &quot; , the robot does not have real women . &quot;
they can &apos;t separate from their companion or simply walk .
&quot; they have no interest or background history , nothing that could distur@@ b to independence or anything about what the imagination could distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you are a single slaves . &quot;

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ verse of healthy human life
&quot; it is too a binding version of the Tr@@ ump era that the political issues that have the US voters did , even families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ est meet it in the USA newspapers with counsel about how to handle the names of Tr@@ ump choice .
we do not allow us to allow us to let us leave our filter bags .
&quot; less notice is the power of tru@@ ths , families together . &quot;
&quot; I have chosen this because my C@@ ous@@ ine , a lin@@ ks@@ in , who lives in Chicago , and have a long time with the Republi@@ can in our family , this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a common enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the French conversion , with which they fought for decades , suddenly , and entirely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it &apos;s very important to me that this is also significant risks with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effects of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ est way that us will not find us on the gr@@ ills of one day . &quot;
&quot; it is however , however , there is a still lack of long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ s of the right wing . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active No@@ stal@@ ker for Mit@@ t &apos;s Rom@@ ance , the 14 % tax tax ( but at least we did like his tax deduc@@ tible ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crimes . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump is going to qualify the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only , in order to qualify as a vital improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my C@@ ous@@ ine in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the caravan park , and the best three dollars , which can be used in the city , when one needs no c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ rig and the animals turn to look at full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and the climatic conditions . &quot;
&quot; so many cli@@ ques of a city &apos;s dis@@ cip@@ le : the views of high buildings are old , the SK@@ Y@@ LIN@@ ES are familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; there is no Swiss Cottage in the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the themes @-@ Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not yet - but a great round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; if I would have liked the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but for luck has to be asked . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to assess my experience with transactions in a scale from one to five stars before I could pull my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee bar on the corner of my road , it is the same , plus the option to buy the evaluation with a 15 % discount extra - this to buy something about the load table . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slow@@ ing of what actually is a neutral exchange , but also pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ el@@ ated , while I felt tired of experience that I made my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; meat products , milk products and chocolate may help to help IB@@ D ( inflammation of the intest@@ ines ) . &quot;

&quot; however , a new study is exactly the opposite : a diet which is rich in flesh @-@ based prot@@ otypes and milk products , could the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases . &quot;

&quot; however , the fact that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han developed the essential amino acid of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from Prot@@ on to develop the immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ cells in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bre@@ ads may hide in food , not in the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , which are glu@@ ed , inflammation of the cells are balanced and protect the tolerance and to protect the body without sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can be resulting from inflammation of the inflammation . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a kind of tolerance causes immun@@ otherapy in mice is common to wear a certain bacter@@ ium in their parents . &quot;
the bacter@@ ium needs Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of prot@@ otypes in order to initiate the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial expression - Lac@@ o@@ ac@@ il@@ lus reu@@ ter@@ i - the normal part of the intest@@ ines , and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more h@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice were in their food , the more they had them from these immun@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; he sm@@ iled that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an al@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich food toler@@ ant , less inflammation of the intestinal mili@@ eus , when the same system is also involved in humans . &quot;
&quot; post a message , in answer to the article &quot;
it was that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ dity of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ al that usually normally live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the mice were found in mice and DNA sequ@@ encing , which were found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in the mice . &quot;
&quot; in a ster@@ ile environment , in a ster@@ ile environment , so that the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om was not developed , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria will grow on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and over@@ led small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ rip@@ e immun@@ otherapy , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ate the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid is cleaned , it proved as a side @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ aboli@@ sm , which is known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ mil@@ ky acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers found the amount of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the m@@ amm@@ ing , the number of such cells increased by 50 percent , but the number of cells to half the half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ated cell cells like M@@ ubar@@ ak and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans , as with mice , but defects in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with anti @-@ inflammatory responses . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of this cells is likely that we would like to promote these cells of inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potential results can lead high Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a extension of this population .

costs of the White House costs
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine helicopter to the South of the South of the South of the last month , the tax exc@@ uses to the military production in the last month , to be up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President on Board was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American building programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tive officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter , besides a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ able car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House have to be responsible for the presence of the helicopter in a popular mental order or F@@ RA@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to be aware that you are aware of it , because it is an unusual event with high visibility . &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter was met on 17 July in the South of the United States for the event around 15 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
&quot; the note also adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the working hours a second team is required for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original flight was rebuilt during the event during the helicopter while the security personnel , during the time at the plane during the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the top of the page , the records did not clear whether the second aircraft is necessary . &quot;

&quot; a question that we were created , whether it was a violation of the Hat@@ ch , and we were informed that this was not the case . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; was covered by the White House as a official event , and would not be covered by Hat@@ ch Act . &quot;
&quot; but even the official events have a political role . &quot;
&quot; at the event , President Poroshenko has agreed to reform the reform of the healthcare reform , which was in the Senate of the Senate . &quot;
&quot; the use of the air@@ plane , which is known as a Marine One or Air Force One is known as a new phenomenon , hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;

&quot; as Tr@@ ump beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House 58 exercise places through . &quot;
&quot; the flight to the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event takes place in the training course for the month , said . &quot;
&quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units are in addition to 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presi@@ dents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax ev@@ okes the load for any of the other Re@@ quis@@ ites that were presented on the event .
&quot; a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in the helicopter in the South of the South . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not require Bud@@ get@@ te drawings for the presi@@ dency of flights and it is difficult to identify the exact costs for the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ d of the US Defence Ministry of 2017 for the year 2017 , the Do@@ D package for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however , 24.@@ 380 USD per aircraft hour . &quot;
&quot; * * * Sor@@ ry , this property owner doesn &apos;t provide a description in english ... &quot;
the White House argued that the real costs for the operation of the lifting screw is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax transparency on the basis of estimates of the estimates of the estimates are highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press pre@@ acher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicopter to the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut was very proud to announce that they are on our national security , and I go out of that hundreds of thousands of people are dependent on them . &quot;
&quot; and I think of most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for so many Americans won &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; of course , there is a picture of course . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump is inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he saw his tour on the South of the South for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , and served with the media on his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;

&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was appointed by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg . &quot;
&quot; however , with a high degree of diversity , the best@@ seller could also fall for the students of the students . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to many other documents , many victims , that many victims of the general humanity of R. is estimated and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; Mr. H@@ es@@ man , the 440 @-@ pages report about the &quot; pre@@ valence of violence in the Reg@@ ard Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives an ab@@ omin@@ ous image of the cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; to a lift many students his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for others , he also appears as Ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ume , the oil of the oil was not a top performance . &quot;
as values as its bi@@ ograph this report report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : when one reads the effort and the entire 440 sides of the front of the front of the front , one must ask if the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all . &quot;
&quot; they are just eight sides , and it will be clearly visible from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the Mitt@@ ler@@ k or co @-@ person in the terrible cases of sexual ab@@ brevi@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the development of the &quot; &quot; democratic &quot; &quot; economic situation , it is also reflected in the sphere of sphere . &quot;

the truth is : the report reli@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
the report helps answering the following questions :
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the final report also applies to any distribution or compassion for sexual abuse on sexual abuse ?

no one of the 67 victims of sex@@ ually excessive over@@ grips are determined by the cathedral master .
not once the parents were arrested .
&quot; I never thought about my father or my mother , saying , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the true problem at the enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , and yet that most victims of shame will be silent . &quot;
&quot; when they were un@@ familiar with parents and compassion , they don &apos;t have to be a choir conductor , who would have been able to have been a col@@ onel of the perpet@@ r@@ ators of the perpet@@ r@@ ators of the perpet@@ r@@ ators . &quot;
how to rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of mis@@ understanding cases ?
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to pray for him ... Continue reading or clear@@ er or even more , than to their parents , Intern@@ ships , trust , trust etc . &quot;
you will be able to talk about sex ... - hours of hours .
&quot; this report provides you with valuable data on the actual market situation , trends and future outlook for furniture in the country in question , 2015 @-@ 2019 ( US dollars ) &quot;
&quot; all sexual abuse occurs , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was born out of every member of the team . &quot;
&quot; so it can not be thrown into it , it does not prevent him or to display it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to bring its good name with these contradic@@ tory crime in conjunction , as it was in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; with the Reg@@ ens@@ ory Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be thrown into the report &quot; &quot; sign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
what do you think about this life ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : this is the great problem that in the reporting of everything , and in the reporting of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the midst of the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot;
&quot; it is very clean : between the pre@@ school and the cathedral of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , and say to rest , rest . &quot;

&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : since there was no discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , when the report came to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. is estimated and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even even positive memories with him . &quot;

&quot; in spite of all efforts the report is only two periods , where it was reported to him . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish his predecessor , and was responsible for the predecessor to a school where he did not listen to him , and then again to 1993 . &quot;

&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ agements that was even re@@ manufactured by the report . &quot;
&quot; in it , it has to be practic@@ ed that in the pre@@ school , the test sentence shall be practic@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of neg@@ ation , he was able to participate in the danger of the danger . &quot;
&quot; that was of course at a time , as a legal basis , as a test judgement was prohibited in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they did not know in a legal gray area , as every of us still knows . &quot;

&quot; in 1980 , the test results of schools also has been officially completed in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; the princ@@ ess of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis , it was also important to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical reports on the then time of time . &quot;
what do you see ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : we speak the &quot; &quot; case of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; so the danger , that it has to rate the moral of today &apos;s moral responsibility . &quot;
the princ@@ ess was right .
&quot; but this is of course not for sexual abuse , which was in all times , and not for what was in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence . &quot;
that &apos;s all quite terrible and I &apos;m happy that it will finally be done .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take a Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for disciplines and best@@ os , thus ear@@ ns and ears , and the ears of the ha@@ irs were far more widespread . &quot;
&quot; as a physical body , he has been prohibited . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his reg@@ ens@@ ary time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
the topic of test results are also available to language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : now , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , and Pope Benedict XVI . &quot;
&quot; no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
&quot; but that must be said : without these perfection , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly possible to say that it would hardly possible to say that it would hardly possible to say that it would have been hardly possible to form the real cultural bot@@ her@@ on of Europe and its musical tradition , the same twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you won &apos;t have a large singer and before every success , but always discipline , passion , passion and self @-@ catering . &quot;
&quot; as for one person , you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks on their book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ man : through the work on the book and beyond , I took Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well , and again , as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep and heart@@ y people , from which one could not imagine that he could do only one fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen even today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him , he is almost blind and him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was not strictly to them , so clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful for him , that he has brought her life to life and the world of the music . &quot;
&quot; and that he always had a good , v@@ amp@@ y teacher - a str@@ anded father , but it may be a nice day to see today , and that she was still trying to look at today . &quot;
&quot; and please , even once again , all that you were pre@@ th@@ ened , are the educ@@ ators who were at the day of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have been doing this time .
&quot; but it is highly unfair to make a man , just because he is alive and has a more prominent brother , to medit@@ ate for medit@@ ating sin@@ king . &quot;
&quot; it is the evil intent that stands behind it , just too too . &quot;
&quot; because the report that was published , was reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now it would be possible to get a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired a lot of services and maybe , no one , no one that would be able to know the Reg@@ gio Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
