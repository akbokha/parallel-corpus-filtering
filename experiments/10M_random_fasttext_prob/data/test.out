&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to expand its investment programme and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements are not too far from each other . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he has held this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message that it was time to rise to the front . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting was only because they wanted to listen to Putin from the President of Erd@@ ogan , which he wanted to listen to him . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is clear on the hand . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Erd@@ ogan is required in the first ten months after the last month in a serious scale , almost his am@@ bition has been in the last month . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there is also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have met Turkey - especially the prohibition of charter flights , each year or several million Russian tourists visit the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number is increased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , trips and charter companies will be easier to travel when the flights will be recorded . &quot;

&quot; Ankara is in Ankara on the west , since it was a reaction to the tried @-@ out of the reaction to the tried @-@ out . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the persistent Gro@@ ll about the Schn@@ eck@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - to reduce the impact of Turkey to reduce the impact of Turkey to the West . &quot;

&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow can support Moscow &apos;s role as peace , but where Russia and Turkey . &quot;
&quot; for almost three hours later , both presi@@ dents at the press conference told that they would have not been broken down . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey ref@@ uses it to answer to a question about their differences , while Putin came to stress this . &quot;

&quot; R@@ BS has already stated that there are his six Nations sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the tru@@ ths of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands ; how do we concentrate on the inside ( we have asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the board member . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very old , if we were told that we would have to be a great bank , and these stamps would have been done . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can make these brands back again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

why do we need to know what we need ?
this is what I am among the women &apos;s Olympic Games in the Tur@@ ning and the more than one reason .
&quot; firstly , I am since 1984 on every summer season and the USA were never so pleased . &quot;
&quot; and second : this team has three tur@@ nings , Simone Bil@@ ba@@ it , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ ren &quot; Her@@ od@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish , and Ma@@ di@@ son co@@ asts , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is round , makes every proud . &quot;
this team reflects the US against the US .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ical female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female audience was one of the female Americans . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
that shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas is a surprising view of the Olympia@@ stadion and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to be able to witness the incredible performance of the tri@@ pled world champ@@ ionships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ od@@ dez , as they were un@@ expected , but the G@@ ym@@ as@@ sic routines are now available . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone is the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americans who won in an individual multi @-@ competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won the silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so you can &apos;t see the classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son , to create it into the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Pre@@ ten Five , &quot; because the next Olympic Stadium is only four tur@@ nes in the crew . furthermore , the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i is a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so far better sport is more expensive , and I decided in the first line in private gy@@ ms that can be used for training , travel , competition , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their families and families ) . the list can be set anywhere . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ ms are able to support a well @-@ established pre@@ lude to support the business .
&quot; in these rules , I receive a lot of training and that is for families an expensive and long term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ vin , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ od@@ dez , both their athletes have begun , since they have begun . &quot;
&quot; we must be inspired by the churches of Au@@ n , young girls , who inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie inspired , a fast and easy @-@ to @-@ offer training exercises . &quot;
I have founded my turn@@ table by 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have free and affordable turbines in Harlem for about 15,000 urban teen@@ agers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home city ) expanding to offer the youth of high @-@ quality turbines that offers the opportunity to learn from these great Olympic sports art and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit . &quot;
this combination provides a long @-@ lasting benefits for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls who are interested in the turbines and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is a so exciting time .
&quot; thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic teams and thank you to start their way to begin healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

&quot; we said with Rh@@ one M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ a Ver@@ a in New York to find out how to go with armed rob@@ bery . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you will show you from the front or rear , you will show this video how you turn it into the sp@@ ear . &quot;
&quot; if you can see you from behind the rear , then you should see that you can see that you can see that you can see that you can see your att@@ ackers and &quot; &quot; from the line line &quot; , &quot; says M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your arm arm and shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; beat him with the knees into the body , and turn it out , while the att@@ aches of pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run and move back , while the weapon hits him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ackers you approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take you the weapon and turn them , so you can &apos;t shoot them . &quot;
&quot; you save the weight to the weapon , and beat the attack on the breast , then turn the weapon out of his grip , before they move back and the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is M@@ iz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a smo@@ ker in the saf@@ est of your money - if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .

&quot; before opening each accommodation , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show us what he will be . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Circle &quot; , brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the rin@@ se of a train , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely ab@@ omin@@ able , but indeed , in a kitchen , more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of dar@@ mb@@ ones and their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing , what he dis@@ liked , more than one bad taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his dar@@ ms by the world , and as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to rail stations to sink and sink , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample . &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; already I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have taken all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , spice and s@@ amm@@ o water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to meet his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he dis@@ si@@ ghted it was a great public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed a L@@ umin@@ ant number of over 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ators are fresh@@ ly darker than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there were a Russian toilet , which he concluded , after their L@@ umin@@ ance number over 4000 units , during the fresh hands of less than 60 per cent . &quot;

&quot; we brought the crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings through that that we told &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you say that the interest in the intest@@ ines is to a global phenomenon .
&quot; instead of just about the products , we wanted to talk to a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of the intestinal health and as it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide consumers more information on an interesting way . &quot;
I think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , the Director of the film , added : &quot; let me say , I have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have been able to l@@ end it , as the ek@@ el@@ event@@ h Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them , and other where this was pretty difficult . &quot;

&quot; after they had been removed from their property , they found the property rights in an ir@@ rever@@ sible state . &quot;

&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was for the people here , and I am the view that people don &apos;t live on this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider because this property is probably not so beautiful part of Corn@@ ille@@ au .
the family is ber@@ ing and it is also a reputation .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who were in the apartment , and the police said that the terror was added to the tabernacle of the road that the family had added to the street . &quot;
&quot; skel@@ eton , 47 , its name on the rental contract , stayed in June a arrangement of anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be rounded off under the circumstances , old per@@ ll have found &quot;
&quot; they were in the estate , in which the past of drugs were open to wood ven@@ eer . &quot;
&quot; they said that they saw them on the street , and regularly the police had to be arrested . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ wall Housing stri@@ ped her and her partner , this week , after they gave them a long period of 11 weeks to volun@@ tar@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; the dol@@ ites were killed by hundreds of neighbours , saying that their life has been made for hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; You asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always impossible .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are unbeliev@@ able . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we were on because there was so quiet - that we are not known !
&quot; now , where they are finally , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , the En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have been faced with the local authorities to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to the police in regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the left side of the municipal house , &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ sile strength , any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a delay of the last step is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing must consider . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because it was extremely difficult and to see their actions for their neighbors .
&quot; I find all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , who have been cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will not be toler@@ ated and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a very good mattress , which is covered in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dol@@ om@@ ination on the floor . &quot;
&quot; the house is located in the middle of the village , where the house is located in the middle of the village . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the police took place in the house through and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as commodity , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in height of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; the skel@@ eton of the skel@@ et@@ ons of the skel@@ eton , the skel@@ eton of the skel@@ etal system , and the skel@@ eton of the skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; she said that the money for a tomb of her son Lee Bur@@ don is , who came in 2013 at a auto@@ cla@@ fall of 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were without having the roof , the T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many guest rooms of the house were decorated with gra@@ ffiti .
police says that they will not stand against the household .
Angela C@@ row from the Police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall signed a clear warning to the other ten@@ sions that do not hold to the household .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can take without self @-@ action , as well as those who were in such a behaviour , &quot; said she said . &quot;

Turkey : short assembly took place in mass tourism
&quot; for those who don &apos;t want to be an@@ xious and re@@ ass@@ ment , &quot; says the General Meeting of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ ka@@ un . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the international community of Germany expects about ten thousands of protective seek@@ ers who fled from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be some hundreds of hundreds of thousands , who believes that the band@@ age of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard pre@@ cip@@ ation of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip , Erd@@ ogan was expected to have a mass decline in Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the same time I had ten thousands of thousands , medium and a few hundreds of protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ ogan regime had fought the minority interests and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; as the government had already passed a few months ago , the government had taken over a short period of months in Turkey to escape from Turkey to the end of Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the occupied Put@@ sch , we still saw blades and op@@ posi@@ tivity and op@@ posi@@ tional door . &quot;
many will begin in Europe when they start in Turkey .

&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the country has not been held back to the end of the summer holidays , the heavy duty was decided on the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is not possible to change the summer holidays , heat and weather conditions . &quot;
the locals who will be convinced by the authorities are convinced that are in the holiday .
&quot; the most of most tourists who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not the locals to choose the country . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , posters , posters , air ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and at the end of voices , only on the end of voices . &quot;
&quot; to the 4th of September 2016 , the election - and last holiday days , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go beyond the people over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say it is just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister , Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / Euro coalition must be to fear his ministry . &quot;

&quot; as an interior minister for him , however , is located in results and at a &quot; re@@ alist &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent events in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , a little time comes before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
this is the most comprehensive abstract database ( not full @-@ text ) of psychological literature .
&quot; it is known that a new security officer is to take care of it is not new , it is not new . &quot;
&quot; however , the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on flight data and ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities do not work .
&quot; for the first time , a second stop for proposals that were not to do with the SPD , he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for the SPD &quot; , &quot; the Euro @-@ man was one . &quot;

&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it can &apos;t even say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
&quot; in addition , many people asked about security concerns about security . &quot;

is it a collector that I wonder ?

&quot; these sound panels , above ( he has sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , and suffer the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford to buy and again , and again , when he was young and pl@@ enti@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; many things that I receive , are out of the late 60@@ ties , the early 70@@ es , as I was 11 or 12 . things which I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; says he says . &quot;

&quot; the S@@ ingen , Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has been accompanied by her whole life : as a young girl , she was in school &apos;s choir , the teacher of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seni@@ ors choir . &quot;
&quot; they sing me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , they feel balanced , and a total of life , says it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it does not make them good for her health and the spirit of something good . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; most of the seni@@ ors were sing in the choir and share with equality in the music , describes H@@ ac@@ as . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the regular meeting , you can use social contacts and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; it is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people , and is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; and to organize and organize themselves on the other - a choir is a very special form of thinking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the positive sense is to be clari@@ fied in the positive sense . &quot;
&quot; for example , seni@@ ors have a depth and controlled breathing . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; also when it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour community of seni@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a lot of great importance to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; the songs are observed that the S@@ ingen or horns of songs are many memories , often associated with positive feelings . &quot;
&quot; by Li@@ ed@@ SS and especially melodies themselves confronted with demen@@ tia on long @-@ term events . &quot;
&quot; at S@@ ingen , the head also receives a special performance . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , to concentrate on his own voice and to concentrate on a given rhythm and to concentrate on the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
just older people who live alone are not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one can read by the S@@ ingen in the choir .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows by the s@@ ingen in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will be better and growing over me - this experience . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the S@@ ingen , there is enough enough . &quot;

&quot; groups like the &quot; identity movement &quot; try to get their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional complaint . &quot;

this is not a concrete advertising for the own thing .
the propaganda should be emotional .

the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi police .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government reserves under Obama statements , it shows how to change reports from its subur@@ ban , a optim@@ ising picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as a journalist or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 , many Central Command regulations , opinions of opinions and statements from the Congress was clearly positive than the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com ruling has been known that a military re@@ mark of Mos@@ aic has already begun in April or may 2015 . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the State of Iraq , the second largest city of Iraq , remains still under control of the Islam@@ ische State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is clear clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , CEO of Kansas , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 till mid @-@ year , the points of Central Command will change the points of Central Command . &quot;
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after them that analysts was worried about the manipulation of reports of the Islamic State .
&quot; on Thursday , the report will continue to rise up by detailed insights into the investigation during the investigation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports are held by the General Assembly of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; a democratic members of the news agency ek@@ om@@ itt@@ ees published on Thursday their own findings , which are in accordance with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has an excessive force process for creation of accounting services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot;
&quot; this process , such as the ship , &quot; delay the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; the moral under analysts and &quot; gave little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Boat and Democrats gave no evidence on a intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
&quot; in the last August , the New York Times , the New York Times , published by the General Manager of the Pentagon , after the complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ acher of the Pentagon gave a statement that the defence ministry was no reports of the congress page , during the investigation of the General Assembly . &quot;
&quot; but he was also pleased that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; experts say that &quot; experts say that &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts say that &quot; &quot; experts are looking for the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the defence of the Ministry of Education and the Defence Ministry of the National Defence Ministry . &quot;
&quot; the investigation took place on the question of a successful air campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria , which is made by the growing number of family members of the Ministry of Defence Ministry . &quot;
&quot; last year , the question of the last year , however , President Obama has left the Central Command of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the Islam@@ ist state will remember the Islam@@ ist state in Iraq , as a Cent@@ Com analyst , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a font in Iraq , and a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 and about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; in the past year , the team for Mr. Hoo@@ ker has no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this pro@@ visional Government has been taken to sell oil on the black market . &quot;

&quot; several factors , why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of age is now explosion under the surface of explo@@ sives . &quot;
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; in the last few years , many of the people were able to communicate with social media , because bil@@ ingual smartphones more frequently and more frequently and the internet services are improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , many people still need to communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies , where they want to stop . &quot;
several young people went to them that they were able to find themselves as prot@@ agoni@@ sts .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as the two largest eth@@ anol in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
&quot; on the other hand , the Am@@ har@@ as , which was mainly in the country of Christian High countries , in politics and economy , while they live the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in flat regions . &quot;
but also the changes are just straight .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a shield , &quot; said Mul@@ lah Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia un@@ fair was dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which is around 6 percent of the population and the military , in the secret services , in the trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ ius .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former Reb@@ row leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ commercial illness in 2012 17 years of the Year of Spain . &quot;
a man who could think of the corners could think .
&quot; analysts say that it was especially in fact , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special claims to edit opponents and make them in@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Mr. Ab@@ di said , Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot;
&quot; the church of the new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been chosen to increase the position of the Lord Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Mr. Mel@@ es who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of North America , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the South . &quot;

many consider that the result could be more blood vessels .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was experienced in such an accident , 2005 , after thousands of elections , according to the number of analysis of the government , and afterwards , according to the Government of the government , the government has been stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Thursday , many prot@@ esting were killed , even when it was less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this reason , however , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
but obviously this is not the intensi@@ fying of the internal mis@@ understanding of the ep@@ ath@@ ic government .
&quot; and she takes a dangerous form . &quot;
&quot; last month , prot@@ ested in gon@@ ads , a am@@ har@@ ian town , from Tig@@ ray to the shops and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray in the social media . &quot;
analysis say that the protests were the US and other Western allies in a unique position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ macher to the neighbouring countries , even when they recently discovered that it has closed this basis . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly shows democracy , he wants to support his allies in a already vol@@ atile area . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Lord Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this way , Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disper@@ se the last con@@ fer@@ ous that his campaign was established , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; in this case , new questions about the communication skills of the Presi@@ dency of the Republi@@ can , whether it is clear and comprehen@@ sible to the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his co @-@ operation to take him during a event of protecting him during a event of protection , in which he could not have to say that he could not have . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the impact on Thursday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claims on Thursday and took part in the interviews that he really did not intend to announce the President and Mrs. Clinton . &quot;
&quot; but in a early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ able . &quot;
&quot; this was the contrast to the previous day , to which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of interviews said , he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump help him to remove the statement that Mr. Obama did not want to know that Mr. Obama did not want to know the French Presi@@ dency . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism at Mr. Tr@@ ump down , while he tries to guide the focus of his campaign on the economic situation . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton employed to the economic situation in Michigan , in this week . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump was again back to this subject . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , Facebook , Del@@ icious , Dig@@ g , Reddit &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the end of July he went strong criticism as he said , the Russians should say Mrs. Cl@@ int@@ on E@@ mails , but he said , &quot; &quot; I think the s@@ ark@@ able table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the language limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test such messages from his fans as they arrive , and then add to &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is simple enough to hold his statements , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; rather than the sound for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has been accepted , as its reverse results . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was published on Friday , a guided tour in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his prov@@ ok@@ ants and not exc@@ use to understand his statements , his statements to destroy his statements or humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze will be brought to him into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how to prov@@ oked his statements . &quot;
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership
&quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he was founded in the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ aus@@ ani , if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton was founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; in this sense it is true that Obama has a nearly un@@ known , small organization , he called them back , completely false , and therefore it happened because he went out from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; to argue that the government has been able to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign Minister , it has allowed to be able to move to the situation in the Middle East in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump his attacks on the media , and threw them in front of his words . &quot;
&quot; the poor , j@@ aded &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

the melt @-@ out of Al@@ co@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and risk .
&quot; this step follows the years of years to the future of the plant , originally published as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the straw guide for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , the big aluminum mel@@ mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang a power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , stated that three more owners have received their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and AL@@ U@@ MIN@@ A , of which the Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p smaller ways . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant in Port@@ land is still operated , which means a further physical demand for electricity due to the melt means , &quot; says the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said that the contracts were so called &quot; &quot; safety business &quot; , &quot; which should be held from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period so that they will be 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L is that the contracts will contribute in the fiscal year of 17 for income , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
&quot; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L reported that the value of the contracts has already been written in the amount of contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the mel@@ ting to operate or the power supply to the melt heat . &quot;
the U.S. companies told that 2010 a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang was completed by November of this year .
analy@@ sing due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible clamping force of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in regard to the statements of the analysis of the introduction of the week of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land is around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts to electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both plants should disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as power generators , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

scientists have previously stated that the slow speed of Venus through their dense atmosphere could be explained .
&quot; but the latest process indicates that the Venus could have a thin , similar atmosphere could have had a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the model illuminated also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet proved to have more dry areas as a earth , but had enough water and geographic variation in order to reach lives and faster evap@@ oration . &quot;

&quot; very early beginn@@ ings , especially in a depression often , &quot; &quot; We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be a different factors of one another .
&quot; for example , for example , a band@@ age cannot lie down , all two to three hours and begin at home , about everyday problems and care to gre@@ edy , and We@@ eks have an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
from when to go with sleep disorders on your doctor ?
&quot; if you are a period of a month at least three nights per week , a doctor should go to the physician . &quot;
&quot; the im@@ pair@@ ment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , non @-@ s@@ lic@@ ed , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easy to be careful with attention and physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; in order to re@@ lie@@ ve the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ oral therapy or medicines - classical battles , only in the exceptional view and maximum for two weeks - in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable . &quot;
there are no translations available .
&quot; for this reason , one should turn out of sleep problems at the house of the house , &quot; &quot; We@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
&quot; who should stop the stroke , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; for instance , if there is a lack of respiratory disease , for example , with respiratory infections , or if you do not find the cause of a passage . &quot;

after the cab@@ ling you go to bed in bed .
&quot; apart from the electro@@ des at the body , one nose straps , chest strap and a towel on fingers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling on the ceiling . &quot;
how can the problems arise in the handle ?
there are quite many different screws to make a better sleep .
&quot; of course , there is a number of sleeping places in bed , but not to sleep in bed , but don &apos;t sleep in bed to sleep , alcohol , and at night - then starts at night - then you &apos;ll immediately start again , and that &apos;s entirely and not permitted . &quot;

&quot; in the first sight , a few kilometres away from the village of Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain takes place in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain on the first glance , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; the road from east to west along the west , one comes to game , a refresh@@ ingly beautiful garden garden and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a gray house , someone has &quot; h@@ yster@@ esis ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to a Li@@ dl , who will also be able to live soon : until 2017 , there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rent apartments . &quot;
&quot; in the last few weeks , the real estate company of Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain will be considered to be preferred in the last weeks in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents were occupied with the ground floor , however , are occupied with spaces and will be used for events . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Interior @-@ sen@@ ator , had been pronounced for a hard course of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous power . &quot;
&quot; after the 22nd of June the rooms were held on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ ena , with 300 police officer , pat@@ ched the police three weeks after the place , shut @-@ off parts of the street , and took visitors to the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the fourth construction workers in the job of the unknown house owners were the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration office that had been illegal , and a day later moved police and construction workers under the Ju@@ bel of Sym@@ path@@ ic and An@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; on this summer , the road is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the mayor before the houses in the sun , other enter@@ tained . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , a basic school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left force is not the main or@@ ge of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has since 1999 in the Old Testament , and Jana * that is here three children , above all of the police officers . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the concern before rising and gases . &quot;

&quot; Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a lower average interest in comparison to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , there were many houses in the former GDR : 1990 were occupied numerous houses in the former GDR , including nearly all the mother@@ ship roads in the Riga . &quot;
&quot; during the mother@@ ship , many of the projects in Riga was leg@@ alized , many of the projects in Riga , which had been occupied by the people , which had been occupied with 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming increasingly popular for tourists and the European liner from all over the world . &quot;

&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ aer will be attacked as symbols for this development , one can see them at the same slices or fresh @-@ painted fac@@ ades that were treated with colour . &quot;
no other street was mentioned in this year so often with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;

there are no translations available .
&quot; in addition to the fact that he is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here it helps each other , live together on the road and gets more than one another . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been moved into the Riga road and stayed in Riga .
&quot; for this reason , it was so important that the inhabitants have returned their road : from the police , the politics and the media , which suddenly , in July all , suddenly on the territory . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants , as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to continue to continue the road . &quot;
&quot; they are not very interesting apartments that are not interesting here - here , rather people who are not so good . &quot;
