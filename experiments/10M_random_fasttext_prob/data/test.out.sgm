<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia all other than an example for democracy was - human rights organizations have continued, the suppression of the government - the opposition in the country was limited to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to the exile or into prison, killed or into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>

<seg id="29">"several factors, why feelings of the bitterness after years of age is now explosion under the surface of explosives."</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the last few years, many of the people were able to communicate with social media, because bilingual smartphones more frequently and more frequently and the internet services are improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, many people still need to communicate via internet-proxies, where they want to stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young people went to them that they were able to find themselves as protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas the two largest ethanol in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"on the other hand, the Amharas, which was mainly in the country of Christian High countries, in politics and economy, while they live the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in flat regions."</seg>
<seg id="37">But also the changes are just straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a shield," said Mullah Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia unfair was dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which is around 6 percent of the population and the military, in the secret services, in the trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenius.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former Rebrow leader, was up to his death in a non-commercial illness in 2012 17 years of the Year of Spain."</seg>
<seg id="43">A man who could think of the corners could think.</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that it was especially in fact, early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special claims to edit opponents and make them inharmful."</seg>

<seg id="46">"the church of the new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been chosen to increase the position of the Lord Meles."</seg>

<seg id="49">Many consider that the result could be more blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was experienced in such an accident, 2005, after thousands of elections, according to the number of analysis of the government, and afterwards, according to the Government of the government, the government has been stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Thursday, many protesting were killed, even when it was less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the reason for this reason, however, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this is not the intensifying of the internal misunderstanding of the epathic government.</seg>
<seg id="54">"and she takes a dangerous form."</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protested in gonads, a amharian town, from Tigray to the shops and hatred towards the Tigray in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysis say that the protests were the US and other Western allies in a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenmacher to the neighbouring countries, even when they recently discovered that it has closed this basis."</seg>
