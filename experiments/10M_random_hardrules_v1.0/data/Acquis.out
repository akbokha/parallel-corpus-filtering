the drawing would be carried out at the BI@@ Z at disposal of a foreign exchange , very likely in US dollars ; they would be able to negoti@@ ate the funds of the Bank , expected three or six months .
the conditions are those who meet the BI@@ Z on the respective time at similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would be largely largely to market trends .
