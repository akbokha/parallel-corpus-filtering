A@@ bili@@ fy will be used to treat glau@@ coma and prevention of Man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients that have applied in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased in@@ hum@@ ble or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the or@@ ale intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or mel@@ ting tablets in patients who prepare the can@@ opy of tablets .
in patients that use other medicines that are just as an@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted to reduce the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; ne@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol works primarily as a &quot; parti@@ tioning Ag@@ on@@ is &quot; for the recep@@ tors of the Neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ ol@@ amin and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lower measurements as the ne@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter in order to activate the recep@@ tors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder can play a role , called Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , enabling psychological or man@@ ic symptoms to be prevented .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the effic@@ acy of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders , which was compared with a number of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabili@@ sed over twelve weeks , in another study the effic@@ acy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo , which had been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms are already been stabili@@ zed using A@@ bili@@ fy symptoms .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution was used in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which was compared to a di@@ arr@@ ho@@ m ( another anti @-@ psych@@ ic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of symptoms are based on a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who study on the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also led studies through to examine how the body makes the mel@@ ting tabl@@ ettes and the solution to initi@@ ate the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the two studies with the injection molding of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant decrease of symptoms occurred than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , reduced A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies are effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy deals with up to 74 weeks , more effective than plac@@ ebo , who was previously treated to patients with previously treated patients and when it was additionally to an existing treatment .
one of the most common symptoms of symptoms such as the number of symptoms such as the number of symptoms such as the number of symptoms such as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am symptoms , and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am , and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take care ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ ur@@ ra@@ mid@@ ale distur@@ ban@@ ces ( fer@@ mentation ) , tre@@ m@@ ep@@ ence ( fer@@ mentation ) , fatigue , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , pain ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , pain ( sleep ) , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety levels .
the Committee for Human@@ it@@ rea ( CH@@ MP ) reported that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had to over@@ throw the vast landscapes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee on the result that the advantages of injection molding is not suitable for rapid control of dis@@ astro@@ logy and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with man@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ie or patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes .
June 2004 : the European Commission on the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for domestic transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is for the treatment of severe to severe epis@@ odes of the Bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a reduced dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of the meals .
an increased effic@@ acy in the dose of 15 mg has been detected by a daily dose of 15 mg , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as Mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder at patients ≥ 65 years .
with regard to the higher sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ group should be drawn into consideration when clinical factors are fulfilled . ( see chapter 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 account is set out of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the inci@@ dence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psychological disorders and aff@@ ective disorders , in some cases after the start or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a patient study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder is no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied to patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases , her@@ edit@@ ary disorders , her@@ edit@@ ary disorders , her@@ edit@@ ary disorders , treatment with blood@@ stain@@ ed diseases ( including acute inhal@@ ation ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

the effic@@ acy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study at the 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which lasted three quarters earlier in anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some of a gift or Mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional method of drugs using ( given in combination with other medications to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional to@@ li@@ ta@@ sis of the medicine .
the patients who were treated with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated as time until the prevention of disease and survival is no difference between the drugs and survival .
in contrast to patients who had previously received other treatments of their metast@@ atic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators such as Abra@@ x@@ ane more effective than conventional drugs .
it may also be applied for patients who have allergi@@ c or before the beginning of the treatment of low he@@ els pay in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ Bon@@ z@@ inc@@ ture ( CH@@ MP ) reported that Abra@@ x@@ ane during the patients in which the first treatment is no longer suggests that the first treatment is not more significant , more effective than conventional n@@ li@@ ta@@ y drugs , and that it has to be used to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission on the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited is an approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indi@@ rectly for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .

since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the Data Protection for Z@@ omet@@ a is on the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women involved with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , and it was examined the number of vert@@ eb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures on a period of three years .
the second study showed 2 127 men and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently signed a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of fac@@ tions over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get was tested in two studies at a total of 357 patients and six months long with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( one other bis@@ cuits ) .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effic@@ acy was whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ m , bone sub@@ str@@ ates ) in the blood to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ bles has been reduced by Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years ago compared to the patients under Plac@@ ebo .
in comparison of all the patients under acet@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) , with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under acet@@ ate a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta are within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequently less frequently .
Ac@@ la@@ sta should not apply to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ cuits or any other components .
as in all the bis@@ cuits , patients are subject to the risk of kidney failure , reactions to the in@@ fu@@ sions@@ ist and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( ext@@ inc@@ tion of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ tu@@ sta introduces the explan@@ atory material for doctors who use Ac@@ tu@@ sta for treating oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis , the information contained in the medicine , as well as the material for patients who should contact the doctor &apos;s side effects .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Governance Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which is explained how the Committee shall be evaluated in order to enter recommendations regarding the application of the drugs .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can apply together with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ kam@@ ent ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( particularly important patients ) can be used with met@@ form@@ in only in the highest dos@@ ed dose is not satisfactory .
in combination with an Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ meth@@ ane or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl or ins@@ ulin can be maintained in the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl or ins@@ ulin can be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be better , and the blood sugar levels , resulting in type @-@ 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients treated the effic@@ acy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with an Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ meth@@ ane , in addition , they received up to 3.5 years of either ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ gible ) is measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos was led to a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ C advertising , which makes the blood sugar levels of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic material in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ C values around 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo at a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 289 patients were examined in addition to ins@@ ulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ C values of 0.@@ 69 % compared with 0.0@@ 14 % compared to patients with additional plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos were tend@@ disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( sh@@ aking ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ esia ( decrease sensitivity towards wealth ) .
Ac@@ tos may be applied neither in patients who are over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or one of other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ ols ( high c@@ et@@ on@@ set - aci@@ dity levels - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos are not shown as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients with met@@ form@@ in patients .
on October 2000 , the European Commission said the European Commission to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited are an approval for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , around , con@@ vex and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also shown for the combination with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , whose blood sugar is set with ins@@ ulating on ins@@ ulin in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility . ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years , the application is not recommended to use in this age group .
patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. an early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ are heart disease ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and the dose varies .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced ro@@ di@@ ally reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oil , when pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ able out@@ break @-@ study with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease was carried out .
this study showed an increase of the reports on heart failure , which led to a increase of Mort@@ ality in the study .
patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used for pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased , the liver level values as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms develops , based on a hep@@ atic dys@@ function , such as unknown nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , appeti@@ te , appeti@@ te , and / or dark har@@ n , are the Leb@@ er@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic values .
the decision on whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on shall be led until the preliminary examination was led to clinical practice .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a reduction of weight gain has been detected by fatty acids , and in some cases with a fluid cell .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ r@@ ta@@ z@@ on , under the therapy of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a slightly reduction of medium hem@@ mo@@ cy@@ bin@@ es ( relative reduction in 4 % ) and the hem@@ angi@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction in 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in such a controlled @-@ controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3.6 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 3.6 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin in patients , pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on as or@@ ale branches or three @-@ fold combination therapy with an Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ meth@@ ine or two professional combination therapy .
after the release the release was filed under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ ash , including pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , and a occurrence of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular de@@ ms , with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is unc@@ lear whether there is a direct connection between Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , if patients should be aware of a mac@@ ular de@@ generation , an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be taken into consideration .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of improved events with random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on were treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
frac@@ ture frac@@ ture inc@@ ture amoun@@ ted to 1,9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study on 3.5 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) of the patients with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on treatment with patients who were treated with a comparison treatment .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy or if a patient has a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment ( see chapter 4.6 ) .
studies typically have shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on has shown that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical industries of Dig@@ ox@@ in , inventory , phen@@ otype and met@@ form@@ in .
in combination with drugs that can be seen from this enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ tors , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ al , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ous and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A defects are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ tra@@ itor ) result in one increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on for 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) result in one reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on around 54 % .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on in the pregnancy of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ ine and increased ins@@ ulin , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ ding growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( made of actual data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ or and the B@@ rech@@ ose of the lens as they are observed in other hypo@@ cris@@ y of active substances .

it has been a summar@@ izing analysis of improved events regarding treatment of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind and clinical studies on a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in comparison with comparison treatment methods .
patients received a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , which were treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on treatment patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) for patients who were treated with a comparison treatment .

in a plac@@ ch@@ oscop@@ ic study about 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar , despite the three mon@@ ati@@ te optimization phase , was adjusted to Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ C is a value of 0,45 % compared with patients that continue ins@@ ulin in the patients with Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on treated with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on treatment .
clinical trials showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg of the plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks prior to type @-@ 2 Di@@ abe@@ tik@@ ers .
in most clinical trials were observed compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total vitamin @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol as well as small , however , clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels .
clinical trials include a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , the total plas@@ ti@@ ques and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level during met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a study of 20 weeks minimum Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on does not only reduce the de@@ centr@@ alised tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ x , but also also the post@@ erior tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ c@@ als , both have a effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d @-@ absorption as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d @-@ synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned out@@ break @-@ study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing symptoms of patients with a period of up to 3.5 years , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ ul@@ ular therapy , either Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on quickly res@@ o@@ unded , whereby the peak concentration of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is usually 2 hours after application .
this base corresponds to the effect of M @-@ IV for effectiveness in about the results of pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical industry or pharmaceutical industry by Dig@@ ox@@ in , inventory , phen@@ otype and met@@ form@@ in .

according to or@@ aler application of radio@@ active Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on by humans , the marker was mainly on the threads ( 55 % ) and a lower amount in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mid @-@ sized plasma treatment period of un@@ changing pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active met@@ abolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metast@@ ases are low in patients with limited kidney function in patients with limited kidney function .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and mon@@ keys were repeated after repeated of the plasma volume with hem@@ a@@ emia , An@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ al ex@@ ual heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the treatment with pi@@ og@@ li@@ ta@@ z@@ on which reduces the hyper@@ tension of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ ine and increased ins@@ ulin , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ ding growth .

plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ in@@ in@@ ability of study period of 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a significant increase in comparison with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a significant reduction in the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um p@@ eg@@ els under 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant over@@ flow for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily than a conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the decrease of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ ns@@ ā@@ n@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit to the doctor visit to the doctor visit to the whole treatment of the whole treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ ass@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl , 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restri@@ ction The AP@@ EX study shows the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney function restri@@ ction ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary importance of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in accordance with the percentage of the ser@@ um function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ mac@@ ular concent@@ rations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had received a ser@@ um concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
in two years of collected data of the open @-@ extension study of the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the lower concentration on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the acceptance of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation was found in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a gyp@@ sum of patients ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients were not required for treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was with a reduction of the tox@@ ic@@ al size associated with 54 % of patients that had a complete dis@@ appearance of the gi@@ cht@@ san@@ e to the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ A / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with February 2012 ( 5.0 % ) , and also with patients who received the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open @-@ term studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
healthy subjects increased the maximum plas@@ ma@@ kal@@ ine training ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plas@@ ma@@ kal@@ ine time curve ( AU@@ C ) of February 2021 @-@ based and multi@@ pler dos@@ es from 10 mg to 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( one disease which is used for men@@ op@@ ause ) when the men@@ op@@ ause is used for women after men@@ op@@ ause .
the patient has to take the Tabl@@ ette with a full glass of water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the food , drinking or allergi@@ es of other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vitamins supplement ) .
in order to avoid a friction of the food , the patient may be taken up until the first food intake of the day , which will take over 30 minutes after intake of the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin C already are used separately in drugs that are allowed in the European Union , put the data from earlier studies and published in literature .
the company presented a study with 35 males and 68@@ 2 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in relation to the effic@@ acy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to increase the effic@@ acy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to the increase of the vitamin D @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment was the proportion of patients with lower vitamin @-@ D mirror in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
the companies also put data from that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose is exactly the dose of the dose , which is necessary for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of di@@ gestion , Dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ y ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ els ) , ej@@ ection , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ el ) , ste@@ pping , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ el ) , ste@@ pping , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( blades ) , ste@@ pping ste@@ pping ( saw belly ) and sau@@ ces .

there are no data available to provide information if the removal of a bis@@ cus therapy is decreased to reduce the risk of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in patients that reduces the risk of oste@@ op@@ ardi@@ al surgery .
the clinical assessment by the treated physician is essential for the therap@@ ist planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients should need to take them during the meeting of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the Tabl@@ ette to the next morning after they have seen her failure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should not take two tablets on the same day , but the intake of a tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled date of date .
other diseases that affect the minerals ( such as vitamin D defici@@ ency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ idi@@ sm ) , should be treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium @-@ supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines may be used for the same time when they become at the same time .
therefore the patients need to wait for at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .

there is an agreement with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations to the dose of several days until the Ste@@ ady State .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the Tal@@ bot &apos;s blood is 20 ng / ml .
in the clinical practice , the Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually found in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of ne@@ ph@@ ated patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney , kidney and heart transplan@@ tation , the rule of blood cells were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has too severe adverse events , including the transplan@@ tation or other side effects which may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m .
patients should always use the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of form@@ ulation or regim@@ es should be made under the case of transplan@@ tation for the transplan@@ tation of the transplan@@ tation of the transplan@@ tation .

in three additional clinical studies on patients with heavy up to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lie A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drugs was examined by the prevention of blood cells as well as surgical procedure .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ances in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well . &quot;
the most frequent side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed during 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ actor ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies in the factor of VIII .

after a view of the CH@@ MP , not sufficiently shown that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ women tum@@ ors benefits benefits for patients .
the Committee had a concern about the processing of the drugs by using in the body , the kind of booking , as well as the safety of the drugs .
in addition , the company does not have sufficient evidence that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced on reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment even for people who come in en@@ close contact with the patient .

Aer@@ ok@@ ze is applied to the treatment of the seasonal all@@ erg@@ i@@ tis ( hypo@@ cris@@ py ) , characterized by an all@@ ergy against p@@ ples , in patients with nose syndrome ( hidden nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents from 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ ospace twice a tablet that will be taken around with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose grinding ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment period of more than 10 days is not recommended , as the effects of the drugs can be reduced through the nose of the nose .
the main purpose of the changes were the changes of the changes of the hypo@@ cris@@ up@@ unc@@ tive symptoms that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study we carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluation with a standard sk@@ ala , as well as the symptoms of the last 12 hours .
all of these hypo@@ cris@@ up@@ unc@@ tions except the nose reported , the patients received a decrease of the symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % compared with 35.@@ 9 % compared to patients who were p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose grinding of the nose , the patients received a link to the symptoms of 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients suffering from des@@ ol@@ at@@ ly alone .

Aer@@ ok@@ ze may also be applied for patients who suffer from an elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ( increase of the thy@@ roid g@@ land ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension of thy@@ roid g@@ land ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ulation ( hyper@@ tension ) .
on 30 July 2007 the European Commission requested a permit for the transport of Aer@@ ospace in the entire European Union .
the Tabl@@ ette can be taken with a glass of water , however , in the whole , but without them to cr@@ ush , to break or to store them .
Aer@@ ok@@ ze should be applied due to the absence of data for in@@ genu@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not used in children under 12 years .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued according to the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time on 10 days because at long term use activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with time .
after decline of the sw@@ elling of v@@ ascular diseases in the upper respir@@ atory respir@@ atory surgery , the treatment of distill@@ ation can be continued as mon@@ otherapy as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ok@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains the medicine also conc@@ erto in patients who are treated with a mono@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or Hem@@ mer , respectively within 2 weeks after the end of this therapy .
this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ b , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Lis@@ pes@@ eed , ox@@ y@@ le@@ ut@@ amine , Ox@@ y@@ le@@ ak@@ ol@@ amine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ oli , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ ster , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were non @-@ tested and the data are not sufficient to discuss such recommendations .
the safety and effectiveness of Aer@@ ospace were not approved in patients with kidney or liver function for patients with kidney or liver function .
patients must be informed that the treatment for inci@@ dence of hyper@@ tension or a speed@@ y@@ car@@ cin@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) must be set .

there are limited experience from clinical studies to the effic@@ acy of des@@ ol@@ at@@ ologic treatment for adol@@ esc@@ ents of 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mit@@ ory stam@@ i@@ tis ( inci@@ dence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease and can be absorbed according to the same disease and can be absorbed according to the sound of the symptoms .

in a clinical trial study , the use of alcohol and alcohol is not intensi@@ fied by alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
patients should not be clari@@ fied that it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to any interference of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including All@@ erg@@ ischer Ur@@ tik@@ aria were reported by the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us patients with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects that were more frequent than plac@@ ebo was reported ( 1.2 % ) , oral care ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .

in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ish@@ ments , can be divided within the duration of symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergi@@ c reaction or allergi@@ c allergi@@ c .
the resulting allergi@@ c reaction will be defined as a result of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
one of the more than 4 weeks and more than 4 weeks and more than 4 weeks .
as a result of the overall configuration of the question@@ naire , the quality of life is shown to be dimin@@ ished by the result of the result of a result of seasonal allergi@@ c ra@@ i@@ tis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was examined at the underlying path@@ ology as the underlying path@@ ology in the various forms , and chron@@ ological patients may be simple pro@@ spective rec@@ laim@@ ing .
since the history of treatment is an essential factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that des@@ perate idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria can also be confirmed in other forms of the ur@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials about 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first D@@ os@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .

a improvement of Ju@@ ck@@ ens around more than 50 % were observed at 55 % of the treated patients compared to 19 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and den@@ ial , such as a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in an pharmaceutical @-@ kin@@ etic study , which were comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergi@@ c ec@@ i@@ tis population , with 4 % of patients had achieved a higher concentration of distill@@ ate clim@@ ates .
there are no evidence points for a clin@@ ically relevant physi@@ otherapy after once daily use of Des@@ per@@ at@@ ów ( 5- 20 mg ) via 14 days before .
for the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ ges@@ tive enzy@@ mes , however , has not been identified , so that exchange effects can &apos;t be excluded from other drugs .

after adoption of vacc@@ ines , the immune system recogni@@ zes the immune system in the imp@@ aired parts of the influ@@ enza virus .
this is the immune system later in the position , in a touch with a gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus , this family has to form high anti@@ bodies .
afterwards the membrane of the virus combined with the &quot; surface anti@@ bacterial &quot; ( proteins on the membrane , which det@@ ects the human body as physical body ) , and an integral part of the imp@@ eller .

it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medication for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot absor@@ b the capsules , there is no solution to be taken , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be used when the doctor has been taken , which has been taken before the doctor , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood that the virus has been affected by the drug .
the recommended dose for patients with twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs .
with children between four and twelve years and with patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ates according to the body weight .
this reduces the risk of inflam@@ matory drugs in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs in blood and keeps them on a low level .
aids not to heal illness , however , the damage of the immune system and therefore the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who were not treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ations .
with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken on 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ e@@ as@@ m in other proteins .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ induced concent@@ rations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or change in viral treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously received no prot@@ e@@ as@@ m , they had been taken over 400 copies of 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
with children , the Vir@@ us@@ can also have been treated with the children who were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ations were only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ations were treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the virus to 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ mer :
during the patients with HIV , that was against four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ations , there came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for more than four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ m :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ els ) , k@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ els ) , Nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin irrit@@ ation and F@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not apply to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also apply to patients who are mar@@ gin@@ alised ( a herbal supplement to treatment of depression ) or medicine that are just as such as A@@ gener@@ ators and are harmful in the blood of health harmful .
as in other medicines , HIV consists of patients , the risk of a li@@ vel@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( symptoms in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( symptoms of infection ) or a immune reaction syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection , which causes a relaxing immune system ) .

A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs in the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ mer ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used for the pharmaceutical @-@ kin@@ etic diagnosis of am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the application of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out under consideration of the individual viral medication and the pre @-@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is a solution to take advantage of 14 % lower than by Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as cap@@ sel ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the effect of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ ung ) , have to apply higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
the pharmaceutical products , effic@@ acy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined at children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for the application for children under 4 years due to the absence of data for un@@ authorized and effic@@ acy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmaceutical and kin@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and with severe liver function on 300 mg twice daily during patients with severe liver function on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be used in patients with light or regular liver function , in patients with heavy liver function , it is con@@ tra@@ its ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used at the same time with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ dic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ at@@ um ) , may not be applied due to the risk of am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r during the risk of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r . ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be on that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection , and that it can continue to develop an HIV infection or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of a transfer of HIV to other through sexual contact or cont@@ am@@ ination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C suffer and with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have a increased risk for heavy liver effects with potential effects .
for the event of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the relevant information of these medicines .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hep@@ atitis hep@@ atitis shows a increased frequency of liver dys@@ function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ello or other Glu@@ ko@@ ji , is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment system ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the material of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Reduc@@ ed Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly influenced by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ic including R@@ ais@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some of the drugs that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects may cause carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ es ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alities R@@ atio ) , methods for the determination of active substances .
in patients who use these medicines can be taken at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be effective due to reduced plas@@ m@@ asp@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ al@@ ysts with am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , the effic@@ acy of hormon@@ al contra@@ sting can be changed . however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of exchange effects .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given to am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ at@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are even low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity due to the high pro@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ sis of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dar@@ ing solution is applied for children under a age of four years , and should be applied with cau@@ tion with certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration , if a skin is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergi@@ c symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ us , the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gl@@ amor@@ phi@@ emia or an ex@@ pedi@@ ment of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other diseases that were required by the development of a diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gl@@ amor@@ ph@@ ie in connection with the development of a diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gl@@ amor@@ phi@@ c .
B. , higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a long @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
acute patients ( type A and B ) which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ations have been treated over an increase of blood , including spont@@ ane@@ ously hem@@ angi@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immune response , the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) is an anti @-@ inflam@@ matory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or even du@@ ale opport@@ un@@ ist infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or dam@@ aging of symptoms .
although a multi@@ dimensional expansion is assumed ( including application of cor@@ on@@ oster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol , heavy immune response , higher body @-@ measure ) were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates are not at the same time with drugs , which have a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ dic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with less therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be processed together with drugs , whose active substances are mainly related to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r causes a vi@@ ro@@ logical connection and can lead to a resistance development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the attempt to increase the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing of other protein molecules in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; very often un@@ desired effects on the liver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
JO@@ HN &apos;S ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ at@@ um ) The Ser@@ um@@ avi@@ r of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r can be replaced by the simultaneous application of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ at@@ um ) .
when a patient is already cur@@ rant , the amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r@@ è@@ r@@ é is removed , and when possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ets .
one D@@ os@@ is@@ adap@@ tive to one of the medicine is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r together with am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
clinical trials were applied to Do@@ si@@ fication of 600 mg of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , the effic@@ acy and un@@ conditional of this treatment guarantees .
52 % reduced if Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min value of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg / on@@ avi@@ r twice daily daily ) .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous monitoring of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , it will be recommended to recommended monitoring because the effic@@ acy and integrity of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ological study for use of A@@ gener@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ des component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , since the position of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ mer would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ mer and existing data can be raised that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin the servo concentrate of am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din should be effective due to the reduced and possibly different therapeutic areas .
if these medicines are applied to be applied , there are a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring , since an accurate predic@@ tion of the combination of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the same gift of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 193 % and thus to rise in a rise of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin @-@ side effects .
when it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase is advised to reducing the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least one half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ o@@ kin@@ etic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but could be increased by the plasma head of both drug in case of simultaneous aid .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ specific ) to the value which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without any additional application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or In@@ du@@ os of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , if it can be applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to exchange effects .
patients should be connected to toxic reactions that are connected to these drugs , when they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ators .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ m , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da does not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can occur for res@@ or@@ tic disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ on@@ volcan@@ si@@ va , which are known as a living @-@ body ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ en@@ ine , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a decrease of am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um concent@@ rations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ato@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ mp@@ al@@ pin , ni@@ mp@@ al@@ pin , ni@@ mp@@ al@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il cannot be increased by Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , enabling you to increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ators can increase their plas@@ ma@@ ine across the side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , optic nerve and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg proteins twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ ata pro@@ ud@@ et@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , while the end@@ ogen@@ ated cor@@ ti@@ sol ( 4 @-@ times daily ) was significantly decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ working width 82 to 89 % ) .
thus , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment the risk of system@@ ati@@ ent effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Ey@@ kt@@ ase inhib@@ itor such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose refin@@ ance is strongly strongly influenced by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive Enh@@ ancements of the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing .
since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ uli@@ zation of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Reduc@@ ed Hem@@ m@@ acy , including a r@@ asp@@ ir@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine with am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
there will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concent@@ rations to stabili@@ sation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while simultaneously using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ on .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other proteins in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am on a possible increase in plasma tiles from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3- to 4 @-@ ache .
when meth@@ ad@@ on together with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ at@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are even low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the small amounts of historic reasons , there can be no recommendation as the Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is needed if Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
a reinforced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alisation is recommended for the possibility of a decrease or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ bacterial properties ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional appoint@@ ments by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on the hormon@@ al contra@@ sting is not expected , therefore , alternative methods for the conception must be recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful reduction of possible pay@@ ers for the mother in comparison to the possible risks associated with the possible risks .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ productive study on both sides in the u@@ ter@@ us to reach the end of am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r up to the end of am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the further development of desc@@ endants including fer@@ tile and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the adoption of Am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r at the parent .
the integrity of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and with children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the conj@@ unc@@ tiva treatment of the side effects were slightly dimin@@ ished , early on and led to the treatment of treatment .
with many of these events it is not clari@@ fied , whether they are in connection with the medication of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time for HIV treatment of the drug or whether they are a consequence of the Gr@@ under@@ age .
most of the below @-@ side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ e@@ as@@ cul@@ ent patients have received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily daily .

the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
on June 2003 the European Commission announced the European Commission on the European Commission of Geneva AG for approval of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ able form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ able DNA technology under usage of CH@@ O @-@ acid cell membran@@ es ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ aks , egg stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ term enzy@@ mes treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase @-@ defici@@ ency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should occur through a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other er@@ ent met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial assessment rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased by the patient to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined and for this patients cannot be recommended dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and for this patients cannot be recommended dosage .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fu@@ sions@@ reactions that are defined as each in connection between the in@@ fusion or to the end of the in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ate conditions ( see section 4.8 ) .
due to this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which repeti@@ tion systems can immediately be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase are usually form within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fu@@ ro@@ sive reaction must be treated with cau@@ tion ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
due to the increased risk of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption of treatment , due to the theory of increased risk provisions , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of the treatment after a break of treatment after the treatment of treatment .

in the case of light or medium @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti @-@ inflam@@ matory reaction and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen will be reduced and / or reduction of the in@@ fu@@ ge rate in half of the in@@ fu@@ ge rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of individual , severe in@@ fu@@ sions @-@ related reaction must be caused by in@@ fusion , until the symptoms are brought into a treatment with antioxid@@ ant in@@ ika and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
the in@@ fusion can be added to the in@@ fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fu@@ sions@@ rate in which the reaction has occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of a interference with the intra@@ ocular alignment of Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onal / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data in new@@ born that were exp@@ on@@ ated towards Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .

the evidence for the enzy@@ me treatment therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulation of sub@@ str@@ ats and preventing a further accumulation of the enzy@@ mes .
following intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase has been added in the circulation and cells in the L@@ ys@@ os@@ om@@ es , the most significant about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recep@@ tors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients in age of 6 to 43 years .
according to patients for the study , the majority of the patient was drawn from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were rec@@ essed when they had a further exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to go up to 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effic@@ acy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute path in 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ ters .
all patients were subsequently rec@@ essed for a open @-@ label balance sheet , where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks therapy of treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients with a improvement of pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the ability to the ability in the following table .
an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ wer@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the Plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as from the following table .
the acceptance of the expected allow@@ ance FE@@ V is not significantly higher than this period of chemotherapy , and the absolute pul@@ per @-@ volume increased considerably more proportional to the body size of the children .
from the 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ ric treatment given 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , the treatment of G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) found that until the study remained constant .
in accordance with the hetero@@ geneous diseases of the patients , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 26 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a dis@@ sip@@ ation at 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
one year &apos;s open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmaceutical products of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients were examined at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy spr@@ inkl@@ es and 4 with the medium return form ) .
for four patients the dosage was increased by increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a small growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) can be found in the Z @-@ Score for these age group The younger patients with heavy spr@@ inkl@@ ing shape ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium patient form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) , and all 4 patients with the medium patient shape were only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study investigations were investigated by pharmaceutical and dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma @-@ do@@ lic@@ ata on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and 6 @-@ minutes walk .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks .
the dosage intake of 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ous all 2 weeks may result in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , is not shown that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of this two dosing structures is equal .

this means that the active substance use a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi has been examined in three main studies on 1 different adults , the chemical coun@@ seling , which are strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , opposite 69 % of the patients with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .

results of studies with ev@@ eto@@ related chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ related chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the clinical trial and Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron the ability to block the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ centr@@ alization and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of ion channels and the duration of action .
the aim of the E@@ KG report was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. in individual d@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ inners of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ ation of the Plas@@ ma@@ kal@@ ine system , a slow process of the body with a average amount of approx . 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ ma@@ kal@@ ine concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concent@@ rations of the concent@@ rations of 0.0@@ 3- 90 % / kg in general and cancer patients are proportional to the entire D@@ os@@ is@@ range .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es was reduced by day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase the palm tree concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from the pharmaceutical simulation of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days of the overall stand@@ point ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the following intra@@ ven@@ tions of 0.75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the risk of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are consumed over the kid@@ neys , and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metast@@ ases , compared to palm on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower measurements , the I@@ so@@ ber C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A2 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ aboli@@ sm of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ mination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single do@@ sis of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ changing active ingredient for 40 % of the given dose .
after an additional intra@@ ven@@ ous membrane , the total body 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with heavy liver function and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position with palm oil and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of dose is therefore non @-@ justified .
effects in clinical trials were observed only according to ex@@ positions that are considered sufficiently adequate for clinical use .
10 . pre@@ clinical trials confirm that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concent@@ rations of ion channels that are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ mental De@@ er and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high dos@@ es Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose is relaxed in approximately 1 years of treatment ( in thy@@ roid g@@ ums , end@@ ot@@ rop@@ y , mort@@ ars , p@@ ank@@ y , p@@ ank@@ re@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high dos@@ si@@ fication and as Alo@@ xi for the first application , the relevance of this results as low as possible .
the owners of this author@@ isation must take the European Commission on the plans to take care of the participation within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ Bon@@ z@@ inc@@ ture ( CH@@ MP ) has been a negative assessment of the approval of the approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C before the treatment of hep@@ atitis C .
this means that Alph@@ eon an organic drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same ar@@ oma @-@ effective component should have been approved in the EU ( also &quot; reference ar@@ z@@ zer &quot; ) .
Alph@@ abet should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long an@@ hal@@ ted ) hep@@ atitis C ( one through one virus infection ) .
during a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damage caused the liver tissue damage to the liver ( AL@@ T ) in the blood of the liver ( AL@@ T ) in the blood .

the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which was similar to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ing the disease in more patients were again drawn than in the reference ar@@ z@@ bol@@ ts ; moreover , Alph@@ abet has more side effects .
apart from that the trial was taken to study the question of how the medication is an immune response ( i.e. the body is anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ um@@ en@@ ical skin infection ) and small in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ations ( cra@@ cks or cutting edges ) , equ@@ ations and gen@@ ital wounds can be applied .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections , which are caused by meth@@ yl in@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , patients may not be treated more than 2 % of the body surface .

the most common situation with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an attraction of the client .
the Committee for Human@@ Bon@@ z@@ inc@@ ture ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go was over@@ thrown in the following surface treatment of the following surface treatment : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little la@@ er@@ ations , de@@ af or wel@@ ted wounds .

an alternative therapy should be drawn into consideration when after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment have no need for improvement in the infected place .
the impact of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means is not examined and the same application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the small plasma concentration , which have been reached after top@@ ical application to shiel@@ ded skin or infected @-@ surface wounds is a clin@@ ically relevant inhal@@ ation in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .

ambi@@ ance is applied to protect against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that uses the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not responsible for these two diseases .
Ambi@@ ent is applied in a framework of two dos@@ es existing vacc@@ ines , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after adoption of the second dose .
in this reason , Ambi@@ ent can only be used when immun@@ ity is a minimum risk of a hep@@ atitis B infection , and ensure that which can be guided from two dos@@ es in the end of the existing vacc@@ ination plan .
if a re@@ frac@@ ted dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ ent or another hep@@ atitis B @-@ A- or B vacc@@ ine are given .
vacc@@ ine work by taking the immune system ( the natural body of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
once a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and created anti@@ bodies .
ambi@@ ance contains the same components such as since 1996 with imp@@ anz@@ ee Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 with approved vacc@@ ines Twin@@ rix Children .
the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect the same diseases , but are Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children in the framework of one of three dos@@ es of existing vacc@@ ines .
because ambi@@ ance and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients , some of the data that uses the use of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicators for the effic@@ acy was the proportion of the spiritual children which had been developed for a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vacc@@ ine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambi@@ ance has led between 98 and 100 % of the spiritual children of a month after the last injection to develop anti@@ bodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the most common side effects of ambi@@ ance ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ te defici@@ ency , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ urity ( fatigue ) and rice .
ambi@@ ance must respond to patients who may have over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ ph@@ cin ( a anti@@ biotic ) cannot be applied .

hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transferred by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways such as Baden @-@ Baden in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
you can feel very tired , have a dark tor@@ in , an bladder face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms which may possibly need a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ine materials , Ambi@@ ent is not fully protected from an infection with hep@@ atitis B hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ine series was completed with 2 dos@@ es .
if you are able to deal with hep@@ atitis B virus or hep@@ atitis B virus , it is ( although you don &apos;t feel / your child to imp@@ ed@@ ance or sick / feels ) , a vacc@@ ine may not prevent the disease .
protection against other infections caused by liver damage or symptoms caused similar to those after a hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be communic@@ ated .
• if you already have an allergi@@ c reaction to ambient care or any part of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( a anti@@ biotic ) has shown .
an allergi@@ c reaction can be caused by ju@@ ck@@ ish skin , breathing not or pregnant women . • if you have an allergi@@ c reaction to hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B . • if you have a severe infection with fever .
• if you would like to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and usually specified by the 2nd Imp@@ f@@ do@@ sis ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you a vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ ance .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B @-@ vacc@@ ine with a reduced content per Imp@@ f@@ do@@ sis ( 360 EL@@ ISA units of a formal hep@@ atitis B surface and 10 micro gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine is based on effective processing , usually a month after the first dose and will give you a vacc@@ ine protection against the imp@@ eller .
sometimes ambi@@ ance is suffering from persons who suffer from severe blood circulation disorders , under the skin and not in the muscles of your body &apos;s body , or if you are holding a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , or if you / your child in a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ ance can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals may not be sufficient to see that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong reaction to the vacc@@ ines .
21 S@@ ages your doctor if you take your child to other medicines , or if you have any other medicine ( including those who have been booked without prescription ) or if you have been booked before , or if you have been planned or Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ine ( anti@@ bodies ) , or if you are planned in near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is not sufficient to one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine is given at the same time with Ambi@@ ent , should be separate to separate places and as possible as different limb@@ s .
if ambi@@ ance is at the same time or short before or after a inj@@ tion of Imm@@ ort@@ al lob@@ ites , it is likely that the reaction would be sufficient to be sufficient .
usually the ambi@@ ance of pregnant women or the corrupt women are not enough , except it is urg@@ ently necessary that they are urg@@ ently needed for hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ ent Please inform your doctor if in case of your child once a allergi@@ c reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( anti@@ biotic ) has shown .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , please talk with your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Am@@ mon@@ key was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , because due to the sel@@ ectivity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
in case of all patients indi@@ rectly , a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ atic defici@@ ency was already manifest@@ ed on the first 28 liver ( within the first 28 liver ) .
in patients with a delay of the fixed shape ( in@@ complete end@@ oc@@ ym@@ atic defect , which consists of the first life of life ) , there is a indication of indication for the use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is an hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic En@@ cryp@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
for aci@@ dity , for children , which are not in the location , tablets or for patients with can@@ ck@@ dys@@ function is available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is calculated individually under consideration of the protein toler@@ ability and the development of the daily protein intake of the patients .
after the previous clinical experience , the normal day of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg , and with Her@@ bal growing and adults .
patients who suffer from a earliest lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , is the Sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rus or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase defici@@ ency must have ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets should not be used for patients with can@@ ck@@ eye dys@@ function , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ ul@@ ine is when the tablets do not get immediately into the stomach .
each tray AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which is equivalent to the maximum day of do@@ sis .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with so@@ dium magnetic in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with so@@ dium @-@ acc@@ ent clinical conditions only with cau@@ tion .
as Met@@ aboli@@ sm and differentiation of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore conc@@ erto ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ jug@@ ated gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young people in high dos@@ es ( 190 - 270 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of the ne@@ ural distortion and a lower loss of ne@@ ons .
there were also del@@ ayed travel from zer@@ eb@@ r@@ alen syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nerve injury in the brain and thus a dis@@ ability of the brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the mother &apos;s milk is dra@@ ined , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the st@@ agn@@ ation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , in 56 % of patients had at least a unbe@@ atable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of this un@@ desirable events that they were not received with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS in connection .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an impro@@ vised toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was developed by an 18 year old manor life , which developed a met@@ oc@@ ephal@@ opathy in connection with L@@ act@@ at@@ azi@@ ie , peri@@ od@@ y@@ top@@ ath@@ y , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis .
a case of a over@@ dose was carried out at a 5 months old age of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intra@@ ven@@ ous preparation of D@@ osen up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ es of ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ a active connection which is transmitted by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is transmitted by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine which is distributed via the kid@@ neys .
the phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine containing phosph@@ ate ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ at@@ ome ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as fertili@@ zer to the differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ a cycle may be assumed that for each gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is provided and the treatment immediately begin to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome .

due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of the nitrogen compound ( so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , pro@@ so@@ ben@@ zo@@ at and so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , pro@@ so@@ ben@@ zo@@ at and so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , the survival rate of new born in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first living @-@ month ) , the survival rate of Neu@@ schw@@ ester ( however , within the first life @-@ month ) diagnostic agents at 80 % .
patients who were diagnosed with patients in the course of pregnancy was diagnosed at 100 % , the survival rate 100 % , but even in these patients came with the time with many spiritual dis@@ abilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ cut form of the disease ( including the female patients with the hetero@@ geneous form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ y@@ las@@ e @-@ Man@@ der ) , which were treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ an@@ tics and a pro@@ ud@@ inal diet were treated with the survival rate of 98 % .
as an existing neuro@@ logical deficit , the neuro@@ logical defic@@ its can occur in the treatment of neuro@@ logical conditions .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is used to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ i@@ ously , which is used in liver and n@@ age enz@@ ym@@ atic , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine .
the concent@@ rations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and his Met@@ aboli@@ tes in plasma and Ur@@ als were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium ker@@ ato@@ id and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of or@@ thodon@@ tics from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and his Met@@ aboli@@ tes was also examined in cancer patients according to intra@@ ven@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a orange @-@ dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in Tabl@@ ette shape , 15 minutes after intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were found 15 minutes after intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ cy@@ cl@@ y@@ dys@@ function or hem@@ o@@ bes@@ e@@ opath@@ ic ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) at the next morning after the next morning after the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( 20 g / day ) were treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day ) , which were treated in the medium Phen@@ yl acet@@ ate concent@@ rations in the third day five times higher than after the first for@@ en .
differentiation of the medication is within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
after the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , so@@ dium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were not treated with toxic and non toxic d@@ ots treatment ( examination 24 and 48 h after or@@ atory evaluation of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ulate is either be used ( sa@@ ug@@ ging and children who are still not guar@@ ded , or patients with can@@ ck@@ disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or nas@@ al son@@ de .
after the previous clinical experience , the normal day of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg , and with her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
the concentration of am@@ mon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly des@@ ol@@ t@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally amino acids ) , Carni@@ tin and servo drives have been kept within the normal area .
patients who suffer from a earliest lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , is the Sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rus or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which is equivalent to the maximum day of do@@ sis .
if R@@ ais@@ f@@ uses before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ aboli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ ent in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain tissue .
an impro@@ vised toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was developed by an 18 year old manor life , which developed a met@@ oc@@ ephal@@ opathy in connection with L@@ act@@ at@@ azi@@ ie , peri@@ od@@ y@@ top@@ ath@@ y , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis .
the phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine containing phosph@@ ate ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ at@@ ome ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as fertili@@ zer , to differenti@@ ate the differentiation of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy
on the basis of investigations on the differentiation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ a cycle of 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .
as an existing neuro@@ logical deficit , the neuro@@ logical defic@@ its can occur in the treatment of neuro@@ logical states .
after a or@@ derly single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after intake of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of about 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spo@@ on 2.9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
when a patient can receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can be dis@@ solved in water ( the solvent of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in the water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing specific liver cells , so that they can escape the sti@@ ff@@ ness of waste products that could not be eliminated after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you need laboratory testing you need to inform the doctor that you can use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat the results of certain laboratory exam@@ inations can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you have any medication or pharmac@@ ist please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or pharmac@@ ies , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .

* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
during the PCI , the patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in Ar@@ ter@@ ie , in order to prevent a closure of blood circulation , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart disease or re@@ membran@@ ce ) after 30 days or a year , as well as the conventional treatment .
patients that were subjected to a PCI was an@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators as well as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy blood , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not apply to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergi@@ c ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , other sh@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it may not be applied for patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ar@@ z@@ inc@@ ture ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that An@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ eh@@ ar@@ er replacement for He@@ par@@ in .

the recommended initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient starts to be a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and in@@ fusion for the duration of the input to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI can be taken from 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg will be charged , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of the following intra@@ ven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the input .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened at 225 seconds , a second head of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight will be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low values , the constitu@@ tive and fertili@@ zer drug should be carefully mixed in the application of the application carefully and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis of the application .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitor is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sions@@ do@@ sis is right .
