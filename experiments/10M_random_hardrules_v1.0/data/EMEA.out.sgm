<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets that can redeem in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres of thinking and speaking, Hallucinations (listening or information of things that are not available), Miscellaneous and madness; • Bipolar-I-disturbances, a psychic disease characterized by the patients of manic episodes (periods of epilepsy).</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify will be used to treat glaucoma and prevention of Manic episodes in patients that have applied in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased inhumble or behavioral disorders, if the orale intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or melting tablets in patients who prepare the canopy of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients that use other medicines that are just as anbilify, the dose should be adjusted to reduce the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells through "neotransmitter", i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works primarily as a "partitioning Agonis" for the receptors of the Neurotransmolamin and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called Serotonin called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lower measurements as the neotransmitter in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can play a role, called Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, enabling psychological or manic symptoms to be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, which was compared with a number of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify has been stabilised over twelve weeks, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, which had been stabilized to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms are already been stabilized using Abilify symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify Injection solution was used in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which was compared to a diarrhom (another anti-psychic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of symptoms are based on a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who study on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "the company also led studies through to examine how the body makes the melting tablettes and the solution to initiate the solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection molding of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant decrease of symptoms occurred than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, reduced Abilify in four of the five short-term studies are effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify deals with up to 74 weeks, more effective than placebo, who was previously treated to patients with previously treated patients and when it was additionally to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">One of the most common symptoms of symptoms such as the number of symptoms such as the number of symptoms such as the number of symptoms such as Lorazepam symptoms, and were similar to Lorazepam, and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take care (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extraurramidale disturbances (fermentation), tremepence (fermentation), fatigue, Nausea (nausea), fatigue, Nausea (nausea), fatigue, pain (nausea), fatigue, pain (sleep), Insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety levels.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanitrea (CHMP) reported that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia, and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had to overthrow the vast landscapes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks associated with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee on the result that the advantages of injection molding is not suitable for rapid control of disastrology and behavioral disorders in patients with manizophrenie or patients with manic episodes.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004: the European Commission on the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for domestic transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is for the treatment of severe to severe episodes of the Bipolar I- disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with Aripiprazol, see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a reduced dose of 15 mg / day each day regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in the dose of 15 mg has been detected by a daily dose of 15 mg, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as Monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder at patients ≥ 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the higher sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialgroup should be drawn into consideration when clinical factors are fulfilled. (see chapter 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 account is set out of combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The incidence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychological disorders and affective disorders, in some cases after the start or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a patient study showed that patients with bipolar disorder is no increased risk of suicidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotika.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied to patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases, hereditary disorders, hereditary disorders, hereditary disorders, treatment with bloodstained diseases (including acute inhalation) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>

<seg id="47">A weight gain is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, and in patients with bipolar biopolitics, the application of antipsychotika, with which weights have been observed in which weights are observed and could lead to severe complications and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, when Aripiprazol in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs are taken into the side effects such as sediment (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist Famotidin, a Magensic acid Blocker, reduces the Resorpute rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant to clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6-inlays (Chinidin) the AUC from Aripiprazol to 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective Inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetin and perfoxetin, similar effects, and therefore, similar dysfunction should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 's' (= "Send") Metabolishing, the common application with highly effective Inhibitory of CYP3A4 in higher Plasmaprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensional metastatic.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you have the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4-Inhibitors with Abilify, should the potential benefits of potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective Inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-proteashibitum, similar properties and therefore should be made similar to similar dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="55">After finishing the CYP2D13 or 3A4-recording, the dosage of Abilify to the Dosisal height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escortopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be calculated with a rise in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed a result of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (macular optic), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (macular optic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant women during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data conditions for security when people and in the reproductive studies must not apply to this medicine in pregnancy, unless the possible benefit is to be used for the risk of risk.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotika, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including force vehicles, to operate until they are safe that Aripiprazol has no negative influence.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as not insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can apply together with another Diabetesmedikament (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (particularly important patients) can be used with metformin only in the highest dosed dose is not satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with an Sulphylmethane or insulin, the previous dose of sulphylmethyl or insulin can be maintained in the beginning of the Actos treatment (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphylmethyl or insulin can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better, and the blood sugar levels, resulting in type-2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients treated the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with an Sulphylmethane, in addition, they received up to 3.5 years of either actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glykosyligible) is measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos was led to a reduction of HbA1C advertising, which makes the blood sugar levels of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylactic material in a reduction of HbA1C values around 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo at a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients were examined in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1C values of 0.69% compared with 0.014% compared to patients with additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects in connection with Actos were tenddisorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (shaking), weight gain and hypoesia (decrease sensitivity towards wealth).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may be applied neither in patients who are oversensitive (allergic) to pioglitazon or one of other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic Ketools (high cetonset - acidity levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos are not shown as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients with metformin patients.</seg>
<seg id="762">On October 2000, the European Commission said the European Commission to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited are an approval for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, around, convex and wear on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also shown for the combination with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is set with insulating on insulin in due to contraindications or incompatibility. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years, the application is not recommended to use in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">Patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. an early heart attack or symptomatic coronare heart disease), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and the dose varies.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced rodially reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oil, when pioglitazon is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A kardiovable outbreak-study with pioglitazon patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase of the reports on heart failure, which led to a increase of Mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">Patients with increased output levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used for pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased, the liver level values as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms develops, based on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unknown nausea, vomiting, appetite, appetite, and / or dark harn, are the Leberenzymatic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision on whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazon shall be led until the preliminary examination was led to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, a reduction of weight gain has been detected by fatty acids, and in some cases with a fluid cell.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematrtazon, under the therapy of Pioglitazon, a slightly reduction of medium hemmocybines (relative reduction in 4%) and the hemangiocrits (relative reduction in 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in such a controlled-controlled trials with pioglitazon by 3.6-4% and the hematocrits around 3.6-4% and the hematocrits around 1-2% and the hematocrits around 1-2% and the hematocrits (1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin in patients, pioglitazon as orale branches or three-fold combination therapy with an Sulphylmethine or two professional combination therapy.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the release the release was filed under the treatment with Thiazolidash, including pioglitazon, and a occurrence of diabetic macular dems, with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between Pioglitazon and the occurrence of Makulaödemen, if patients should be aware of a macular degeneration, an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of improved events with randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients who were treated with pioglitazon were treated with pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">Fracture fracture incture amounted to 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study on 3.5 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Fractions per 100 patient years) of the patients with pioglitazon treatment with patients who were treated with a comparison treatment.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy or if a patient has a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment (see chapter 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies typically have shown that Pioglitazon has shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical industries of Digoxin, inventory, phenotype and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">In combination with drugs that can be seen from this enzymes, e.g. orale contractors, cyclosporal, cyclosporous and HMGCoA defects are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Intraitor) result in one increase in AUC by Pioglitazon for 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochroP450 2C8-Inductor) result in one reduction of the AUC by Pioglitazon around 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazon in the pregnancy of hyperinsuline and increased insulin, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the redding growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (made of actual data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the Turgor and the Brechose of the lens as they are observed in other hypocrisy of active substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, ALT attack on the three times the upper limit of the standard area, however, often referred to as under placebo, however, less than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphylmethane.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outpatient study in patients with pre-existing macroeconometric disease was the frequency of a heavy heart failure under Pioglitazon to 1,6% higher than among placebo when Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market release was also known about heart failure in pioglitazon, however, if pioglitazon in combination with insultative insufficiency in anamnese was applied.</seg>
<seg id="795">It has been a summarizing analysis of improved events regarding treatment of randomised, controlled, double-blind and clinical studies on a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients in comparison with comparison treatment methods.</seg>
<seg id="796">Patients received a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, which were treated with pioglitazon treatment patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) for patients who were treated with a comparison treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">Intake of 120 mg / day on four days, then 180 mg / day about seven days are no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on an activating specific core competencies (Peroxisome) Activated Receptor Activated Receptor Activated Receptor (PPAR).</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon the glucosa production in the liver reduces and the peripheral gluten is boosted in case of insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon-versus Gliclazid is more than two years to investigate the time to study the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1C ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of the therapy, a blood pressure was defined as HbA1C &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazon in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placchoscopic study about 12 months, patients, whose blood sugar, despite the three monatite optimization phase, was adjusted to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazon, the middle HbA1C is a value of 0,45% compared with patients that continue insulin in the patients with Pioglitazon treated with pioglitazon treatment.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin-quotives compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg of the placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks prior to type-2 Diabetikers.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials were observed compared to placebo, a reduction of the total vitamin-triglyceride and the free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- cholesterol as well as small, however, clinically significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">Clinical trials include a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, the total plastiques and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazon is a statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol level during metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks minimum Pioglitazon does not only reduce the decentralised triglycerix, but also also the posterior triglyceridcals, both have a effect on the triglycerid-absorption as well as to the hepatic triglycerid-synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a kardiovementioned outbreak-study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing symptoms of patients with a period of up to 3.5 years, in addition to existing antidiabetic and kardiovasulular therapy, either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon quickly resounded, whereby the peak concentration of pioglitazon is usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This base corresponds to the effect of M-IV for effectiveness in about the results of pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical industry or pharmaceutical industry by Digoxin, inventory, phenotype and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochroP450 2C8 Inductor) and reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oraler application of radioactive Pioglitazon by humans, the marker was mainly on the threads (55%) and a lower amount in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mid-sized plasma treatment period of unchanging pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metastases are low in patients with limited kidney function in patients with limited kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys were repeated after repeated of the plasma volume with hemaemia, Anemia and reversial exual heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with pioglitazon which reduces the hypertension of hyperinsuline and increased insulin, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the redding growth.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drugs was examined, it was also measured his effectiveness (by its effect in relation to the reduction of Gag concentration) and in relation to the size of the liver (in relation to the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">With children under five years of Aldurazyme the Gag-concentrations in the Urine at about 60%, and half of the treated children had a common great liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, arthropathy (joint pain), lack of pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), Hitler feeling, fever and reactions to the infusioners.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects on patients under five years, increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of the lung function), speedycarts (accelerated heart rate), fever and protection.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyma may be applied to patients who may have strong sensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphyming reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will present every year all new information which may possibly be known, check and update these summary information.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe Aldurazyme, with regard to the reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">On June 2003 the European Commission announced the European Commission on the European Commission of Geneva AG for approval of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinable form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinable DNA technology under usage of CHO-acid cell membranes (Chinese Hamster Oaks, egg stock of Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is for long-term enzymes treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase-deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should occur through a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other erent metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial assessment rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased by the patient to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined and for this patients cannot be recommended dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for this patients cannot be recommended dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusionsreactions that are defined as each in connection between the infusion or to the end of the infusionate conditions (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">Due to this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which repetition systems can immediately be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase are usually form within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infurosive reaction must be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Due to the increased risk of treatment after a longer interruption of treatment, due to the theory of increased risk provisions, due to the theoretically increased risk of the treatment after a break of treatment after the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antioxidant inika and / or antibodies) to treat the potential presence infuzed reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of light or medium-related reaction, the treatment with anti-inflammatory reaction and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen will be reduced and / or reduction of the infuge rate in half of the infuge rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of individual, severe infusions-related reaction must be caused by infusion, until the symptoms are brought into a treatment with antioxidant inika and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be added to the infusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusionsrate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 will (Antihitherinika and Paracetamol / Ibuprops and / or Corticosteroids) as well as reducing the rate rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusionsrate, which occurred in the pre-balanced reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of a interference with the intraocular alignment of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, the embryonal / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data in newborn that were exponated towards Laronidase over the mother's milk, is recommended, during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Clinical trials were used mainly as infusionsreactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment time up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment time up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesired drug policy in connection with Aldurazyme, during the phase of 5 years or older patients were observed in the following table: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>

<seg id="2634">According to the clinical trial and Palonosetron the ability to block the ventricular decentralization and Repolarisation of ion channels and the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the EKG report was the assessment of the EKG effects of i.v. in individual dosetron in single dinners of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After an intravenous gift follows an initiation of the Plasmakaline system, a slow process of the body with a average amount of approx. 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasmakaline concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentrations of the concentrations of 0.03- 90% / kg in general and cancer patients are proportional to the entire Dosisrange.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was reduced by day 1 and day 5 measured medium (± SD) increase the palm tree concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From the pharmaceutical simulation of 0.25 mg Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days of the overall standpoint (AUC0- ∞) with the following intraventions of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax after the risk of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are consumed over the kidneys, and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metastases, compared to palm onosetron over less than 1% of antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower measurements, the Isober CYP3A2 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dosis of 10 microgram / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found around 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanging active ingredient for 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After an additional intravenous membrane, the total body 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with heavy liver function and the average systemic exposition with palm oil and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron, a reduction of dose is therefore non-justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">Effects in clinical trials were observed only according to expositions that are considered sufficiently adequate for clinical use.</seg>
