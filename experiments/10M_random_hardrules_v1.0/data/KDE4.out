in the lower end of each range you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function that you need to recognize the visible area of the image . to stop the visible area of the image , you must remove it and the L@@ MB ; in the mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ id works as well as in other views . use the zoom regulator under the pictures or Ctrl ; mouse wheel in the picture , and in addition to zo@@ oming . this happens in two pictures if you are in the mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is a digital inventory management - on the other part of the process of the process , after the image has been made up to the fin@@ alen issue and permanent storage . each of the photos will take up to the fin@@ alen issue and the permanent process . each of the photos will take up to the dark issue and the permanent process . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can assure you a tool , a plan and practical tips like you can secure your images , use and photos again .

met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata are defined in accordance with your definition information , information about or a documentation of other data provided by a application or environment .
I would like to say , if you are more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t know how many photos you have , then do not know where many photos you have , then do not know it &amp; digi@@ came ; the approach to store both in a database as well as in the image files , and a secure archiving for you with other programs , platforms and formats can be freely available .
the first what you do and know before you have to be organized in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether or want to save your photos or want to save them on an exit drive or etc . make sure that you need to change it on a bigger drive .
you can also use Add images from folder ... , Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to jquery slider options .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as retro@@ spective of photos , archiving , employment rates , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % work files and you will be able to organise your structure to this content .
which types of files may fit together ? the separation of file types makes it easier to use new of old files .
the separation of original and working copy simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you &apos;ll always know whether you are looking for a original or a left picture .
we also recommend the met@@ adata in the setup page of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ came ; however , you can save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by clicking on the appropriate button .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what would like to change ? it offers a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now , you will now begin the real job , as you can now use any photo gallery , lab@@ elling and evaluation . of course , you can select all images that can concentrate on the same attribute and then reset the value . you can start the best with the review or the ranking .
let us now go out now with keywords , key policies , as you are often called hot , or by categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you are able to import images from a different source with embedded samples , then &amp; amp ; automatically the tree for you to build a different place . the change of the Hier@@ archy within the building is not a problem and can easily be done through the pull of a sub@@ strate .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is clear . this is a very gro@@ be representation , because each block of met@@ adata in truth is made of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and cal@@ end@@ ings are properties of all images .
enough for pass@@ words - the next section refers to lab@@ elling or comments , the third important tool to support your met@@ adata .
they don &apos;t want to look at your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to arrive in the photos of your photos .
look at this panorama . it is not even once a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer to see some details , people , the place .

for other matters of your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to find a story . remember that key is the meaning to transmit to Him through the motif that you moves on to understand what you understand .
it is not a picture when a picture is not perfect when it is the strength only with a circum@@ ference for itself alone .
you can also export it for a selection of images , in an international alph@@ abet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , and you can export it for a selection of images at the same time .
remember the time before GPS ? as you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was they not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of the spatial presentation now is now with a light speed .

of course we are not talking about CDs here on the street or a brand . these type of losses may happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it goes to problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery firm of the world , has some interesting statistics , which has a data loss .
in order to solve the problem by CDs / DVDs , you can also find more than a few years . of course , you can also find more than a few years . of course , you can also find CDs and DVDs in archive quality .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk to the right way and store the right way .
in spite of this massive protection mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control panel .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a special program named I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seem to be available on Windows and DVDs ; but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged components of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to play in the format of the HD DVD . a dual @-@ ray Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is about CDs and DVDs , of course , of course , also for the Blu @-@ ray Disk .
burn slowly with a good recording on high quality media in a non @-@ quality media in a not able format . read the data on the next generation of media before you can read the latest version of hardware or software that can read this media .
select the language in which this site should be shown on the site . in case you don &apos;t have access to extended information such as sound samples despite logging on as a member , make sure your security level is not too high .
in brief : Dis@@ ks are the most common error messages from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . the most common error , SMAR@@ T can &apos;t find these errors immediately .
this is only about the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also restore data loss due to a power if you have secured the files without a big problems .
while most electric devices are not too much easier , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes are different . these can cause severe damage , hardware chips and other defects . protect yourself from un@@ avo@@ idable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power plants is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of energy storage absor@@ bs and the rest .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should look at the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure to protect the protection against flas@@ hing , and thus protects the correct devices .
as a over@@ voltage each cables can be connected to your computer , you should also be connected to your system . this is also possible for phone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms , which can also be connected to your system . other offer connections for the co@@ ax cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the television card .
a wide range of these devices are designed specifically for emergency and therefore very small and you also included the protection for the modem . thus you are ideal for traveling .
during an over@@ voltage protection of your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the electricity lines , it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ il@@ ateral data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a lower power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices allow them to store these devices when a power failure . this gives you the possibility to store the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that is exposed to your computer system , and compare its security in electricity costs ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V , you can think about &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V , you can think about all cables for less than &amp; euro ; 40 costs , an 500@@ W US@@ V you can think about all cables to tr@@ uss before you drive into the holidays .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple storage service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a backup tool for your software .
they are in comparison to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; taxes ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs per year and 400 GB .
solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution but it is not a general backup solution .
your free memory is limited to 1 GB , and you will not want to get your images in full resolution online . the professional version is available on 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution . for 25 $ per year you will get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
the data protection is very secure . transmission errors are automatically controlled thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies it contains a backup and distributed memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ is@@ sions are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
this is why nobody tells you when a transfer error occurred in your hardware . it is quite un@@ conditional that it should not be destroyed by one day . it is quite un@@ conditional that it would have no protection to you .
un@@ reliable power components are a further source for transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ change within data transmission . normal file systems remain un@@ resolved .
even if you are not yet affected by e @-@ mail , you should see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record errors . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one for G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available for this article in English .

these two factors are not responsible for 86 % of data loss due to the driver and 46 % of the working systems . at Not@@ ebooks it is already the share of the th@@ eft of 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than the masters . it leads to a lower damage , such as th@@ eft or new install@@ ations .
open source file systems are less important for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , rei@@ ra , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems .
the backup file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of investigation process is avoided at a sudden inter@@ ruption during the operation . however , if a file is not saved before the problem is lost , it is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : wrong , th@@ eft and human errors are the main advantage of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limitations . it is obvious that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go into the direction of 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already high for compact cameras and a high quality appearance are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a high @-@ format Sens@@ ors ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or greater formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive is responsible for 100 &amp; euro . if you are responsible for any data loss . 6 % of all PCs are responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are responsible according to a plan and test this backup before you use anything of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
do you make every day your backup on an external SATA device . if one day , one day , a flash , you &apos;re lucky if the drive is not connected to the moment .
a des@@ aster suggests to and destroy a lot . don &apos;t forget about air@@ lines : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ eft are dangerous for your data dangerous . you can normally use a whole room or the complete house .
this means that Des@@ aster will always have a local store . bring your steps to the stair@@ way in the neighbor@@ ing house , in your office or similar .
there is a further advantage of the physical separation : as above it is one more likely reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , you can save the one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are secured . it is a moment without history and provides a complete copy at a time .
differential price : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup file . creates a complete copy recording at two time points : the complete backup and the final differentiation .
it is a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status to any time again . this fuse is done by a link system on the next with the exception that it is only ab@@ sent and not continuously .

with this valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year survival is about the period of you really interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be paid for you :
since the future due to the nature of your nature , you &apos;ll have to look at all that today will be said to be careful with cau@@ tion . all 5 @-@ 8 years should be used as the current system back . the less versions you have used in the past , the more easier it is the right to rate the future .
this question should be answered by explan@@ ations in this document . use or change to open standards by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a longer use .
on the other side , the Council is quite simple : if you modify your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary for a ne@@ wer standard .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure to change a system in its size . this means to enlarge .

PNG , gam@@ ma , ex@@ in@@ f and IPTC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PNG can also save many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF , and a slow workflow . this format would like to recommend you to save your images .
TIFF was saved as a image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with an un@@ mistak@@ able compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it &apos;s a problem that this format is adapted to many people . there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .

GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in longit@@ ud@@ inal and wid@@ ths . the determination of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to link a area by automatic recording of the GPS data to Kar@@ to@@ graphic . environmental planner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate funds .
if you want to have forgotten where the photo was made , you can send a browser that shows the territory . if you want to open a post , you can see the location of the photos , so it is good to document the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and maps . the question is actually more , how the data in these fields come ? there are at least three ways to reach this field with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there is a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or by means of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .

and lower areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or lighter color in the picture . these colors will be defined here . in the jQuery Slider window can be found here . in the window you can register with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ strate is known that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ous than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
with the setting of PNG files , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation reduces the image quality , since then the image data is more time for troubleshooting and inser@@ tion . if you have a fast machine , you can use this value to a high compression .
with the option of TIFF files , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF image . this reduces the size of the TIFF image . it has no influence on the image quality because of the DE@@ FLA@@ TE .
even if you are unable to save the loss of quality loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not supported , but in the planning .
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the gallery jquery jQuery Gallery window .
the standard ann@@ otation is that all the green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option to use this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option is a little soft , eliminate the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white off the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour is used .
this setting is used only when the White is not set . standard is a fixed color balance that has been photograph@@ ed on a white card which has been photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ stands the images in four steps more details in the pin . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the default is the nick@@ name , so the parts of your images will appear in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please use the setting out of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can try some parts of the missing information from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spitz@@ ing@@ ame &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible , as blue pixels in general , not so quickly as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ volumes . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you choose the option , you get the option to set up a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted to each image .
if you have to set the L@@ umin@@ escence value according to your taste , you must be probably higher than the standard 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ came ; but you can also keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ Adapter .
a demo version of the algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from part data to calculate a complete image from the colored image sensor , the number of cameras have been known as C@@ FA Inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour reproduction .
after several tests , Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ eity and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ eity and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ eity and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ eity and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the colour and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color of color correction , as it is carried out during the raw material .
a profile presents the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ came ; information such as the colour information from one colour to the other , so that colours are as possible as possible .
if you use jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to use jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive .
color profile directory folders , such as / usr / share / color / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you want to store all your profiles . &amp; amp ;
the ICC profile you have the opportunity to start &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything allows you to change the tube file later .
the colour reproduction view is a alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images printed on the whole screen .
the input profile should use to the camera control and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color ton@@ gs or gam@@ ma@@ correction .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Proof profile , which you can print as your image from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour range as your camera and some colours are very satisfied .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will find these under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools , Internet Options , Privacy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if the topic on colour administration is then , then anyone wants to express the results that he would like to provide . unfortunately , colour administration is to provide sufficient information about colour@@ ing information on each point of the image processing industry . in addition , you will find links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions on your own informed decisions .
if your image has fulfilled all six below , then you must not care about colour administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they work on a monitor on the s@@ RGB colour z@@ ali@@ bri@@ s . ( more information see below ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ RGB the de @-@ fac@@ to standard .
so when s@@ RGB so good works and life for everyone so easy , why should I use another color of color , and to make sense of color cra@@ mp@@ ses ?
there is a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colours that we can see , the hu@@ ber @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger pieces of colour , please visit us and then click on information and then on information about the General Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to read my monitor when I decided to work my monitor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour or not , you need to be able to run your monitor on s@@ RGB and then you have to run your monitor on s@@ RGB controls , then you have to use either your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , an appropriate monitoring profile or both .

this tool represents five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases .
the functions of norm@@ alize , automatic , automatic and contrast from the menu of Cor@@ rig@@ ieren are automatically transferred from your color . they will need to experiment with these effects . you will need to look at the best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method is scal@@ able to change the lumin@@ ance of the entire picture so that the dark dot is so bright as possible . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
this is a very powerful way to improve the contrast range of the selected image , so that the difference between the intensity of a picture , sometimes also produces a very good results for improvement in contra@@ sting of a picture , sometimes it produces a very powerful surgery that can either be used either in a picture or in the same way .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the rotation , green and blue @-@ channel .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture through the lowest possible and highest values on the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b@@ ation of all values . this is only visible when viewed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White came from &amp; digi@@ came ; it is a half @-@ automatic tool to carry the white ab@@ ound of a photos .
the white balance sheet is a little more limited than a color with 8 bits per color . if you can &apos;t perform the white ab@@ out@@ ings in the raw mode , if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which can be used in 16 @-@ bit mode so you will be able to make your possibilities for correction .
you can drag and paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
the display mannequ@@ in can be adjusted to size . on the left side , the original image will be adjusted to the original image as well as the preview of the tool . if you want to see the original white settings , then click the original window .
the goal of the destination photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ator of the pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the vertical line .
at the right above , a hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed when you change a parameter . this script is very helpful , even in good illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees . you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on the shade , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma .
with the above mentioned controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then somewhere on the picture to use the colour temperature of the white balance . to this type the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white papers with the list of the default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ lap indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel . this will be displayed as a color channel . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
to save time and store exactly this . every setting of the White re@@ charge you can save you in a text file and then load it again .
the button extension sets all the filter values again to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white ab@@ out@@ s . note that this can be a different photo as your original . if you save this type , your original image will be changed .
you can also use the Ko@@ di@@ ons depth per colour channel . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality pictures , but can also be used for the formats of PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog such as the processing of tube images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . a det@@ achable instruction for use of color profiles can be set up to the use of color profiles .
this tool offers an integrated way to store multiple color channels and allows you to save your settings for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner is always on the same mistakes and you always will always find the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colour gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to create a solar cell effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ on filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing , solar cells , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created by the additional light . it had the effect that the light areas are dar@@ ker and the colours have been created by the second lighting . the result was a partially neg@@ ation of the image . this tool allows you to use this interesting effect .
the intensity controlled the solar cells . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chemicals is possible . another increase is finally a neg@@ atively image that does not create photo on photo .
this is an example of the solar efficiency effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied number ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
the paint filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ cro provides very saturated colours with daylight and high contra@@ sting colours . Vel@@ vi@@ as is very saturated coloured colors , especially those which have hardly ever seen landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting edges . the parameters level control the brightness of the results , and the rails return the thickness of the ne@@ on@@ light .
digital cameras have frequently problems with light conditions and it is therefore not surprising that you are able to change the different colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colour .
if you do not get a photo in bad lighting conditions , you can reduce the right problem to increase the satur@@ ation instead of it . all changes you can carry out in the preview . if you like the result , you can check the changes with O@@ k .
due to the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ance / contrast / gam@@ ma is the tool to improve the quality of sound quality . even if the dialogue is very complicated , you need for the field of use in the area of the Schi@@ eber .
the window contains a gra@@ ding of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active ridge , or the selected range . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easi@@ est way to learn the operation is to move to move and make sure the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the image will be seen on the left , on the left side of the picture , on the left side the following options are available .
scal@@ ability : with this selection box can be set using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic Y @-@ axis . for pictures the large areas of a constant color is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic calculation is useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones , and the lower part of the middle tones , frequently called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three d@@ umb@@ bells can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input values of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically .
output values : the output values allow the selecting manual values for each section . the compression values can be used in order to change the output values , e.g. for instance , the compression values can be used as background as background while something else in the for@@ eg@@ round .
automatically : using this knob you will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
store and load : with these buttons , the set values in file system can be stored and loaded later . the Gim@@ p Lev@@ els format is used .
if you want to use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values automatically adjust@@ s the colour pi@@ p@@ ette , and then click on the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the Hist@@ ogra@@ m for Rot@@ ating , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ escence channels .
the option to set the option to view all color channels , in order to find clear pixel and allows you to view the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not the effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the input of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is made with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side the half of the origin@@ als and the target picture . the preview will be updated on the right side of your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modifications : this selection box allows the channel to add the channel to the channel :
in addition to this cheese , there are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view .
if you move to right turn right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones can see that this bright tones with dark functions and the related image pixel will be dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photo is a red mark . if you want to change this mark on the field , you want to change the original line on the curve , the original value is displayed on this line and move a point on this line and move the value to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can make sure this . each curve is saved and the file format can be stored and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you want to use this method and the three colour pi@@ pet shows automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and sun@@ rise . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette to set the control points for the rotation , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ che .
the option to check the option to view all color channels in order to remove the pixel . if in more than a channel over@@ hung pixels , you get the combined result . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not the effect on the final result .
below you can see a black white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees . shadow and sun@@ rise was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the canal mixer is a tool to improve the color channels or color sh@@ aded photos of the photos .
the canal mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the pictures . you can edit it from the menu of the channel .
you can select the colour of the channel with the channel . this gives you a first note that you can be able to correct the relative distribution and change . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison via its own rider .
the preview of the destination has a red marker . if you use this in the picture , a vertical line in the history appears to show you the appropriate colour value .
the controls for the module are right below : control for Red , Green and Construction allow you to modify the corresponding colour components . this is especially practical , if you have to keep the corresponding colour components , as the channel mixer then enable you to develop the corresponding colour components .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ on@@ flow , the reduction of a color on a visible noise that comes from the colour to the colour channel . if that is the case , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ et conversion to the same position .
the saving file format is used for this purposes . any any mixer settings can be used for later and then load the used file format is the Gim@@ p ?
the option to set the option to view all color channels , in order to find clear pixel and allows you to view the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not the effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in the blue channel . the option is activated at the Blue channel . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image below ( 2 ) .
black / White photography was always fascin@@ ated because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white , a working step , since color images can be easily accessed on the computer .

using the digi@@ an ; tool texture , you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a text to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil paintings on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or as a wall image on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increase the depth of the depth or three @-@ dimensional of the texture on the picture .
the original image is applied on the photo below . the original picture is on the picture below .
a design tool can be added to a picture with an image .
the eye of a perspective in the limits of a photos is no easy task . a way to keep his attention is to set a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ amed eye . under the image , the module can be started from the window .
type : with this parameter , you set the required tools for your image . through a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce um@@ ran@@ det it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , with a nice 3D frame and a decorative frame with patterns .
width : gives the width of the frame in per cent . the range of value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this is important for the printing of the image , especially when you use the tools of the aspect ratio .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
this tool is very intuitive to use it and place it with the mouse . use tex@@ tures , orientation , color from the colour and character set with its properties like you need .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you press on the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digi@@ p@@ ion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; tool set , you can use a photo on a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag the images ( folder ) to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gallery / Publish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and should be used with maximum comp@@ ost ( 9 ) for inclusion of the file size . if you want to add a e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; please send an e @-@ mail in english .
if you are able to use this tool to use this tool , you must be copied to your carefully selected folders with the button basic folder .
after the root folder for the Stencils was set to be displayed a building view that reflects the ordin@@ ator structure of the box . the selection of a folder will be updated the pre @-@ bar code of the box .
there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button magni@@ fied the dar@@ ker picture . it will be the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this knob is smaller . if you want to use the mouse on the mouse . if you want to use the mouse to the whole picture , you must check the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
to move this button to move it under the right image . take the picture and lay it on the desired position .
if you want to use the photo on your image , the picture is then adjusted to the size .
&amp; amp ; a three different tool for car@@ bide is available . each of you has the advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for car@@ ving . it is very easy and simple , produces , especially in dark areas , grain @-@ specific images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a little bit , it works more psychological . they can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st . they can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refra@@ ction is possibly the best of three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a bit more complicated in his application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus , as well as most digital images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is the same phenomenon , so that the same phenomenon can be summar@@ ized when colour@@ ation points on paper . SL@@ R cameras require the same phenomenon as normal cameras as normal cameras for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; images tagged with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
some scanner use a sharp@@ ness@@ ter already during the picture . if you disable it , you will receive the control over your image .
in some situations , you can find useful results by using a photo using the car@@ bide cutter .
they should be careful , since the results are not very natural , the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also the noise of the edges .
sometimes you have the same problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the image is a little soft way . use the tool to design a little soft way . use the tool to print a bit easier than it . use the tool to select the icon on the right side of the dialog window shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ bl@@ urred is a very good tool to remove grinding from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help the image . the preview of the filter displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameter , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be sure to increase the effect .
the radius represents a number of pixels on each side of a ridge by the filter .
the amount is set between the original and the wis@@ p picture one of the original image is added to the original .
it is possible to define a minimal difference between the maximum RGB value and to the difference amount .
this is an example of the un@@ avo@@ idable filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the image ( 2 ) and the image ( 2 ) . un@@ usually m@@ ask@@ ous with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool refra@@ ct@@ ment re@@ focus a picture through improvement of sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted circulation filter -@@ algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to replace a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on the photo .
in practice , the circular saw has much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s circuit . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s circuit has a very long tail , which leads far from the original pix@@ el@@ ines , which leads far from the original pix@@ el@@ ines .
circular detection : this is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images should result in the standard 1 good results . you can set a higher value when your image is very un@@ sharp .
correlation can reduce the correlation of 0 @-@ 1 . the correlation can be selected from 0 to 1 . the correlation can be reduced from 0 to 1 . the correlation can be reduced to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.0@@ 95 and 0,99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharp@@ ness of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filters : increased value of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the smo@@ ker filter can be low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a high value is still poll@@ uted .
Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use these parameters if your in@@ suffici@@ ency is to avoid . if you have a value of zero , you must also increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ the noise filters .
Mat@@ ri@@ mal size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational material . if you have chosen large values for these parameters , especially if you have large values for these parameters . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving load and load capacity will be used precisely for this purposes . any number of refra@@ ction parameters can be set up for later and can be charged safely .
try all cuts , color and intensity levels on the image before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before using the image above . the reason is that much operations changes are not immediately visible after you can leave the way later .
if you read images and compressed , &amp; lt ; as JPEG , you should use the module on the un@@ compressed image .
generally , they produce better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by a larger neighborhood .
theore@@ tically , this is the result of the FI@@ R Wiener filter , the results of the FI@@ R Wiener filter is always at least as well as the im@@ press mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better with the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different film@@ makers , on a small in@@ spiring picture , see :
this image has been corrected with an analog camera . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car @-@ focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the separ@@ ator is used to generate the sharp@@ ness of the zone in order to create a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
colour z@@ apper enables a adapted colour for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark eyes , then you can set this here .
the tool of image missing is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired speed of Art@@ ef@@ akte .
on the other hand , one of the most important functions of the project is based on one of the most important functions of the project .
this tool contains various pre@@ settings as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are included below :
if you want to use the filter settings , you can use the rider Gl@@ end@@ able and advanced settings .
Detail@@ handels@@ as@@ p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this is the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even more homogen@@ ous regions of the image .
directional keys , Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth in all directions , while a value is close to one direction , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this is the maximum fla@@ p factor over all . p defined then the relative humidity . add this value to the degree of space in your image .
control : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies to larger structures . this is necessary if it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ bs effect , it should be higher than 3 .
ren@@ unci@@ ation : is often found on how often the algorithm will run away . normally , 1 or 2 .
if Alpha is selected as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ y Alpha . if Alpha small is selected , you should also choose that small angle is a long term . you should choose this value so much is possible and for your needs .
integrated ste@@ pper size &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral pre @-@ size in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel spac@@ ing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : thanks to quality that you receive by means of this option is low . it is doubled . if we recommend it to allow it to allow him to allow it .
to save time and store exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very quickly in the work . it can be very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore continue the calculation at any time with the button of the button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small Art@@ ef@@ akte . the module will be applied on a photo that can be found in Guatemala City with an analog camera while the original image is under ( 1 ) and corrected an corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; panel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very powerful tool in order to reduce sin@@ ks . it uses a ur@@ anium @-@ protected algorithm available by Peter H@@ EC@@ KER@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is available with sel@@ ectable image filter to remove stain@@ s and other Art@@ ef@@ akte , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove the camera from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ p images from books or magazine .
if you need more information about the digital cameras of digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen displays a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it displays a body of noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you can find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window settings can remain at the default settings .
radi@@ us controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter and can be p@@ aired with the image and the color in it will be smooth and therefore smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : the sharp@@ ness occurs . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing on the filter to the front in front of ligh@@ test changes . you need to adjust the edges -@@ Filter , if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter can &apos;t be found and smo@@ ked up again .
edges : the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response to the sharp@@ ness . if he is too strong , the frequency response may occur , if you don &apos;t want to loose the whole space or JPEG or JPEG format you want to lose it without details .
fluor@@ escence : the fluor@@ escent resistance of the image . we recommend you either colour or ligh@@ density to improve a picture . these settings can not affect the smo@@ othing process due to the details of the details .
color : controlled colour @-@ toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either colour or ligh@@ density to improve a picture .
gam@@ ma : controlled the gam@@ ma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas that typically be stronger .
damp@@ ing : controlled inser@@ tion of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ it@@ ter@@ et . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of the fluor@@ escence . if he increased to high level , smo@@ ked and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . he can remove them and is the recommended method .
store and store : these buttons are used precisely because all parameters can be stored in file system , which you can be stored in the file system and later .
this is an example of how smo@@ kers can change your life . the original image is characterized by ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) which were applied with standard settings .
there is a picture to cris@@ p for your purpose . this solution , the picture is a little soft too . use this tool to print a bit too much easier than a picture . use this tool to print the menu item on the right side of the dialog window shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ akte . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these filters provide a lot of un@@ desirable Art@@ ef@@ akte from your images . he is very well adjusted to remove the pal@@ ate , film gr@@ asses , compression , compression , and local errors in digital , original or retro@@ active pictures , which makes the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture can be used for color and texture . the text is developed by the I@@ MAGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ ische , and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ akte : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away .
to save time and store exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then re@@ charged later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast in the work . it can be very long and a high CPU load to . you can therefore see the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can see how a photo with a spacer space , .. This module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the original image of the original image under ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can see an old colour photo that was used with a scanner in the scanner . the original image is under ( 1 ) and corrected the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw material photos a problem , because many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; how to remove &amp; quot ; how to remove this method . there are currently no manual method to choose the bad pixel .
download this file into the wizard with the knob of the knob . the tool is highlighted automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to discover the dark grey image directly in connection to new hot or light pixels through CCD defects .
first , as in previous section , you should not find the appropriate wording on the corrected image .
the picture area and the preview will assist you within the picture . the preview of the filter displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are highlighted in all areas .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ rupt the pixel . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ ation : it is measured an average of the neighbor@@ hoods . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective measurements at the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of pixel block , the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixel with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block is drawn to calculate a bi square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square @-@ wide curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
k@@ ub@@ isch : all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged by 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
the order intake is an tool in order to mount the Vign@@ ette , that is lower to correct corners , an image size .
wide angle lens , particularly in the middle and large photo format , can often reduce the entire sensor range . instead , instead , instead the corners and edges of the image by removing the light to the sensor there is also possible .
furthermore , many center filter need a factor 1,5 or 2 when the aper@@ ture filter , which is necessary to keep it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used with centre filter , a opening of f / 16 or small use , because otherwise un@@ contam@@ inated effects caused by movement .
with the large range of view of today &apos;s films and color @-@ scanner , it is possible to filter the effect of a system filter , it is possible to filter the effect of a system filter , which is applied without these filters , which is applied without these filters . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with three shelves , you can control the check@@ out correction filter and with three further steps of the destination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the highest density . the default density is 2.0 , which an optical filter with an aper@@ ture adjustment of 2 , or random@@ ly compens@@ ate to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vign@@ ette , reduce the density to compens@@ ate it to a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ ance , contrast and gam@@ ma settings , the editing of a picture with the Vign@@ ette can be re@@ achable in the pixel . you need to adjust the main values of the target with these options , since you need to increase the settings only .
if you want to view an enemy of the target , you can use the values for fluor@@ escence / contrast / gam@@ ma with zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ an ; Photo from the menu colour engraving .
this is an example of the vi@@ et@@ able correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vign@@ ets in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp and contra@@ sts was carried out in the image with this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lens on photos . it uses a ur@@ anium @-@ protected algorithm from David Ho@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . colour distortion can &apos;t be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ dient is treated in the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can be correct to correct the con@@ di@@ ave form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third floor has a similar circular effect , flat but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient of graph@@ s are corrected the distant corners to the second gra@@ dient . if you can combine these two geomet@@ rical pieces , each geomet@@ rical forms can be eliminated almost immediately .
generally , this value ensures the strength of the distortion of the second gra@@ dient . with negative values , ton@@ gs are corrected and positive values can be modified and positive values .
corner : this value is controlled by the strength of the displac@@ ement . this value is more stronger than to change than in the middle of the image . for most lin@@ sen l@@ ends the &apos; corners parameters of the parameters of the parameter .
zoom : this value is scal@@ able the image size and leads to a correction of the first gra@@ dient through . negative values increase during positive the image .
light : this value indicates the brightness to the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image into the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the compression correction . the values you use for your picture , saved and used to the next start as standard values .
the ton@@ al or thermal correction should be carried out before all cuts or size changes . if you select a picture to cut and then a ton@@ ic correction would be the effect on the effect .
to help you find the best way to find the best correction . move your mouse cursor to an important place like e.g. the sea side or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to correct the lines in your image and press the lines with the help of the lines .
if you have to correct the resulting picture , the resulting picture of black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu trans@@ forms or remove the Zoom of this dialog .
for most pictures you have the ton@@ ed @-@ shaped correction . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from front , frame and paintings it is the perspective so to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always be a slight de@@ bit of the perspective .
this is an example of ton@@ ed @-@ shaped correction on a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website , under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known IL@@ FOR@@ D ( tm ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ intestinal film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film items and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the amount of film gr@@ ate and the Domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter can be produced for re@@ produce from infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense the effect on black / white photos , since the colour information are missing .
this is an example of infrared fil@@ me@@ tic@@ ulated on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of A@@ ura in the Spitz@@ enti@@ ment .
the &amp; digi@@ ster ; filter film gr@@ ation is a easy to use tool to produce film gr@@ ation on your images . this is from classic high @-@ speed movies such as B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the movies to increase the manufacturers of big silver grain of photo @-@ emul@@ sion .
the treated picture shows your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to photograph this special , gallery @-@ like , road photograph@@ ers specially in your mono@@ chrome images , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator you can set ISO sensitivity to control of the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the body and gran@@ ularity of the body . if you need more grain , you can use the filter again several times .
this is an example of the film glu@@ ing effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the work ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Filter oil bur@@ ners creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a ur@@ inary application of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; Filter oil bur@@ ners gives your digital pictures such as an oil painting . natural images and style are well suited for these effect .
there are two controls to influence these effect . the upper part used the Pin@@ sel@@ size between one and five out . thick brush are better for large pictures . smooth controls the glasses or , from the other side of view , the hing@@ es .
this is an example for the oil painting effect . the original image is characterised by the ( 1 ) and the worked with ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixel is 1 and Gl@@ acier 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filters coal drawing is used to generate colours and intensity in order to define a coal in the drawing . the lines which the change in the drawing will not be necessary for this effect . it is helpful when you imagine , which scene you have chosen to ski@@ p to ski@@ zz@@ ing . this would be good pictures to begin .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect .
this is an example of the carbon distribution filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; amp ; filter engraving on your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was used in wax . it uses a ur@@ anium @-@ protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; amp ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works fine with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity in order to transform the picture in a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows the contrast to the contrast of the filter set . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default value .
this is an example for engraving @-@ filter . the original ( 1 ) and the image ( 2 ) . used depth is 10 % .
using this filter group you can transform a norm@@ ales photo in an art work via twi@@ sted effect . it uses the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ el@@ ength 1 : then the image in cells and can look like whether it is seen through glass blocks .
wav@@ el@@ ength 2 : analogue to the wav@@ el@@ ength 1 , the image will be trac@@ ed here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time for calcul@@ ating and create a high CPU load . you can add this effects at any time with the button .
using this filter group you can transform a norm@@ ales photo in an art work by im@@ min@@ able algorithms . it uses the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Zoom : remove the image along the circular lines that is going on . this si@@ eve a zo@@ om@@ ic camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radius _ sharp@@ ness : remove the image through rotation of the pixel to a center . this si@@ eves the in@@ suffici@@ ency of a speed camera .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
this is ideal for creation of romantic portraits , Gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and subtle light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the Far@@ mers in the picture and to change these without the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mos@@ aic : then the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , by filling with a average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time for calcul@@ ating and cause high CPU load .
the shelves are a very small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen to your image . this gives you natural your images a n@@ asty look . it uses natural your images a n@@ asty look . it is used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
tropical size allows the size of the trop@@ ics . since the trop@@ ics size is not automatically generated with the size of the image . number changes the number and the density of the drop . fish will change the optical effect of the drop on the image .
you can stop using the &amp; amp ; you can hold a range of shelves . use the tool to choose the range , for example , a face , which should be free to select the range , for example a face , which should be free to choose from shelves .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) indicates a quiet sunset and the picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo does not have the right orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers .
photo : bladder is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo on a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to ver@@ sion@@ ers is easy . the large question is , how can you achieve a picture and the details ? how can you reach the limits of the resolution ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ?
if a photo is wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select the transform@@ ations in the menu and enter the target values .
the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixel spac@@ ing . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for checking .
many image processing programs use a kind of Inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ines Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying object is developed by the I@@ MAGE team of GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to change the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and will be recorded below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original measurements .
control : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies to larger structures . this is necessary if it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ bs effect , it should be higher than 3 .
the rolls @-@ saving and load can be used as a result . each inser@@ tion of the photo can be stored as a text file and later .

the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged photo ( 3 ) , the original ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear Standard enlargement .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently asked operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to cover a picture . the jQuery Slider will be very simple . to select a photo , click the mouse button and draw the right mouse button and then choose the mouse to see the mouse only while you move the mouse .
if you like the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off , so you get a good overview of your photo to the cutting area by clicking on the corners of the right .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cut @-@ cut , use the button to save the button and the photo will be tailored ( Ctrl + + X ) . use the file to save the file in the menu to save the newly built @-@ cut photo .
in advance , you can change the size of the right by clicking the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which is defined in dialog .
in the mold of the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross format . in the high @-@ format it is always the larger value of the height and the cross format of width .
the tool belongs to the aspect ratio . that means that it is always equal to whether you cen@@ timet@@ res , inch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo op@@ ier and its lateral positions .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are automatically horizont@@ ally horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can cut the range of the range for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the ratio and orientation .
the tool belongs to the aspect ratio , its settings are depending on the size orientation ( horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data is added to the picture above and not the original image .
the settings of the program help enable assistance so that you can improve your pictures better . these help are :
the harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles are an option to share a rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal stage .
golden center : the golden center is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus Mu@@ ch or the Bl@@ ades leaves on a sun@@ flower .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used in the old Egyp@@ ti@@ ans and the Greeks that use your temple and py@@ rami@@ ds in all times when you use your images , buildings and even photos to form a natural order and beauty .
1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition is generally considered as visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden center represents liquid feed available when you are a picture . these help are below are recorded below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring your goal good results for your photos to achieve your photos . in comparison to third parties , the golden eag@@ le produces a liquid line of the viewer . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the Spir@@ ale and create a symmet@@ ric visual river .
another rule are the right angle of the golden eag@@ les , also called golden rec@@ t@@ angle . it should be something that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this is just because its eye can only be done without the eye , it will meet its task .
in contrast to harmon@@ ic three corner points , the middle of the sides of the golden eag@@ le . note that , in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal to these lines . Di@@ agon@@ ale to these lines can be part of static object dynamic .
if you are called golden tri@@ angles , you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try your image fo@@ ils on one of the cut points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options are reflected and vertical patterns can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic division .
with the button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines are invisible . you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn an image to turn any angle .
if you do a photo , then it happens easily , the camera is not vertical or horizontal . this generates a picture in which the things are out of a angle . you can also repair it with the &amp; amp ; you can select the tool and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the Schi@@ eber angle . the values in this sliding settings are available to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be displayed on the right .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation is a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor to the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image . now , you can drag it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you can drag the angle as in previous section .
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the corner where you can drag the images ( folder ) to the corner .
a elegant way to cut the picture . select one of the following options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a little bit after the rotation . please note that the ob@@ session warning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this point is displayed in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to change the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will automatically be re automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new picture , including the empty parts which are produced by the transformation .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty parts of the transformation .
angle on top : shows the current angles in the degree at the upper left corner of the transform@@ ers .
the angle on top : shows the current angles in the degree at the upper right corner of the transform@@ ers .
angle on the left below : shows the current angles in degrees at the lower left corner of the transform@@ ers .
the angle on the right below : shows the current angles in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transform@@ ers .
after the adjustment of the perspective , the picture is a little poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adap@@ tations create a double effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after the perspective you have the perspective you get to the corners of the corners of the corners . one possibility of this is the image with transform@@ ations from the window .
the tool tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and to move to the other part of the image . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is transformed into a parallel port . you can change this module on transform@@ ers .
make your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press the angles , the angle will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target is shown on the right .
on your help you will find a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to a important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines to adjust your image .
the picture may not be used without the permission of the photographer .
after finishing the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility of this to remove the image with transform@@ ations from the window .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats , and in some cases such as these libraries have been created . in most distri@@ butions , you can edit a large number of image formats using &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this dependence of other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all on their system formats . they will always be to JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ came ; shows files in formats to the list . this happens on file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . you can find these list of file extended &amp; digi@@ came ; accepted the file in the list , you can find further information in the list .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format only . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in the Wikipedia .
the compression is the application of data compression methods to digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to more efficient type .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smooth results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000@@ er version can also be saved freely , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw size format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Model and Cambridge . you can find the raw format photos in JPEG or TIFF with the raw screen converter from &amp; digi@@ came ; you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ came ;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographi@@ cally loc@@ alization allows you to add a GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of a picture and process the loc@@ alisation can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographi@@ cally loc@@ alization feature is used to loc@@ alise images with GPS and Galil@@ eo system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo .
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographi@@ cally data in g@@ px @-@ form@@ at@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ you can download the data for you from your GPS device .
this interface allows a number of selected images with a GPS @-@ track .
select the images that you want to load in the main window and call the menu on the top to see a trace file with G@@ PX file . this file contains of course data from the same time to the same sites , as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , the coordinates of the coordinates are loaded in red . GPS sport data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera can be carried out with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the maximum value for the maximum time for the maximum time , the data is carried out for the GPS time and camera . it is the data together with the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for images , you can add the g@@ px file manually and add to the pictures .
the options inter@@ connected and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is a loc@@ ating between camera and GPS , you can set this boundaries here and then press the button .
the coordinates can be set manually on the same place . this is useful if you have a number of pictures on the same place . since the dialog will have to use the coordinates of a call to the next place , you must only use the button below to set the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ alisation can also be accessed using the current map and enlarge it . choose the desired region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be selected manually . the card can be selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there is the possibilities of the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages , select the albums that will be export@@ ed as HTML pages . the character set will be export@@ ed to the HTML pages . the character set will be export@@ ed to U@@ TF @-@ 8 co@@ ded to enable a best possible internation@@ alisation .

another situation is that you want to get a number of images on a printer to see the images on paper . to see what photos you want to see the viewer with the pictures and set it as well or bad , while you can view one after the other .
examples are the letters A to Z and you can use them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the relevant letters . see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set characteristics on your pictures , you can see this in your browser . if you have created it , you can see the selected images on a CD or to copy the selected images on a CD or what you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in view view . if you are viewing this categories , then you can view features to the pictures by simply press the letters , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to do on a picture . for this case allows you to paint the photo album ; on the image to paint .
the Gem@@ stones will not be saved with the image , but in the database .
in order to see a picture on the picture gallery , you can choose on the image paint from the context menu of the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , you simply drag the cross into the work@@ top right at the window .
in order to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , you must have to read the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be sure and understood .
in the property tree you can select individual objects . then the properties can be displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also choose several objects at the same time . but not the lower project is already selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to add the object in the tool or choose a menu entry in the menu .
there are possible positions to select the following link menu , so that you can choose the right position :
either from the menu bar to Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove the selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on the link to take this changes . then you can change the input data , then click the input button and then click the changes to the changes .
if you enter the path to the P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the place , you can follow the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation .
if you edit a text or part of a text , you can view a preview of the self @-@ class view .
click on the preview of the self @-@ defined view and a small example of the scene is selected using the selected text ( for example a text ) within a text editor and not the entire text editor ) , please call locally .
the screen displays the control points of camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button and then change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross is marked the centre for scale and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a visual field for a visual field . you can specify this value relatively to visual object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are chosen or their visual field for smaller or equal parts of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; has a window order as pres@@ et . the object tree and the view of object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window regulations or if you need another arrangement , you can also set it any other window regulations and simply switch between different connections .
to get a window above or under a single view , draw the An@@ f@@ asser to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to right or left hand side of a view . the new view will be anch@@ ored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to place multiple views on one another . you can then change the views through the views through clicking on the map sheet top in the views .
the last possible window regulations are floating in the main window : views , which are not in the main window . to find a view from the link to the work@@ space or click on the left to the top left arrow close to the left corner .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ bar . to avoid the left , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can paste additional views into the main window . in the menu view you can find out entries for any kind of views . new views are bad , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can save you with view files ... save . it will be displayed in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can download it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ew the current scene , click the icon icon in the tool or select the menu entry of the scene .
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the factory folder , click the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialog :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name of any name , sense , but a name that can recognize the properties of the mode .
in the cart@@ el card size , you can choose the width and height of the image . if you want to pass a small area of the image , select the image section and enter the image section to the input field in the input field .
in combination field quality , you can choose the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user interaction . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture with only a rays of pixels can arise from different errors . these pictures have often found a fashion patterns or stucco effects in curves and lines , but sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray of pixel . this technique is called super @-@ Sam@@ pling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; support two methods of the super @-@ Sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ re@@ kur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is still split and adap@@ tively because each pixel is always ready and adap@@ tively to the calculated colour of the calculated values .
if you choose the first method to set PO@@ V @-@ Ray a Stra@@ w per pixel . if you set the difference between the colour of the pixels , then both pixel is calculated by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ Sam@@ pling .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
statistics : posted by bet@@ ab@@ ug at 18 : 25 &#124; Comments ( 0 ) &#124; Track@@ backs ( 0 )
the re@@ kur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values the pre @-@ given threshold then the pixel is divided into 4 lower pixel , the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted to the depth .
another possibility of ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the Stra@@ hl process , called J@@ it@@ ah . if you turn J@@ it@@ anya , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refl@@ ect@@ ion . it takes very long to leave a scene with this property .
on this map , you can adjust whether the Alpha @-@ channels by PO@@ V @-@ Ray will be calculated . a pixel is transparent when the corresponding rays are no object .
opens a new window for viewing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; location to import , select the menu entry and select the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist also supports full command line of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when imp@@ or@@ ating error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you are not support the source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , you want to import this source text between the two particular comments / / * p@@ MR@@ av@@ ille and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag the objects from the object in the editor to import the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to export the source text file in the editor . to import objects in the editor , select the source text in the editor and draw it into the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also included .
the PO@@ V @-@ Ray command will be called , when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist , a scene . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the self @-@ section , click &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the property . place the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .

the paint for wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the colour for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the right for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characteristics .
you can set the object of the d@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the R@@ aster separately adjustable for shifts , scal@@ ings and rotation .
larger values result a precise wire model and therefore a better stit@@ ching for the objects , require more time to ren@@ ew . for some objects such as the ball you can adjust the detail stage for two directions .
when you use High Performance Impro@@ vement , all wire model views can be divided into sections , if the camera is an extended projection . the projector creates a better approach for the proj@@ ections , requires more time for the proj@@ ections .

on this page you can change the existing window regulations or new window regulations . in section the window regulations is explained how you can create window regulations and save .
the combination of standard window regulations : displays all existing window regulations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; uses the selected window regulations at the start of the program .
the list of the window regulations displays all existing window regulations . a new arrangement can be removed with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
each window rules is identified by the name . the name must be clearly visible and may not be empty .
the list below the name below shows all the views on the chosen window order .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ plug@@ ging , you will get a map sheet with the existing window , with the front view , and create a cart@@ ell@@ card .
you have just just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er , installed and now you would like to follow any responses to the two programs . if you follow any steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginner &apos;s popular : a ball on one level .
but you should be carefully checked as a result as a result is just a black screen . if you use a 3D programme for er@@ sten@@ ing , you should specify this important rules :
if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules can be applied for the ren@@ ders , as a result you get a black image .
if you want to add a light sources , your whole scene in the dark and you will get a black picture .
if you have installed everything you have installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist , following the following window :
take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the work@@ stations . please read the documentation , so that you can expect a reasonable idea what you can expect from this program .
you will be able to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; starts with a simple scene . to follow these instructions , you must select all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu entry .
the wire model overview shows how the camera displays all the scene you create . especially notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene of the camera . this shows the result of the Ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on , see the content of view properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change the basic settings of the camera , but note that you can change the camera in the control points you can change the camera in the view . click the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place .
if you press the button or input , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene out of the perspective of the camera .
there are lots of ways to create the ground for the scene . you might want to add a qu@@ ire to the scene , and size on x = 100 , y = 0 , z = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a permanent method to the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; it is actually a simple way . you can use an infinite level than the floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button . in the object tree is immediately displayed immediately .
the wire model @-@ view shows the level when even at the moment only as a restricted level . if you drive the scene , the level until the horizon is up to the horizon .
if you see the object of the object , you will notice that you can see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line . select shift and set the values as follows :
select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something special .
in both cases , a dialogue , in which you can select , as the object will be added to the object . you can see the names in the self @-@ view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments are only a thick black material , because you need to enter the look at the pig@@ ment . do you always remember the colors of materials anytime with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see the colour on qu@@ ad and ball , click on the button and call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correct . if you get your picture with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results :
here you can also find further settings . here you can also find further settings . here you can also find two new attributes . then use this entry twice ( you can also be more frequently asked , but the chess board game can be used only with two colors ) :
select in the object tree sitting hours and change the colours in the view of the object properties :
this step should be easy to run , because you have to create the fundamental position of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ist ; it is just as simple as the floor can create :
in the view of object properties , you can change the settings for the radius : on 1 ( forget not to press the input line or button button ) , so the sphere of contact with the ground . otherwise the sphere can be moved on the floor , because you have the ground around a unit after the bottom .
of course the ren@@ ders is a strange thing : as already before , the ball surface is like a thick black material . do you use the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball you can now see a material . as already in the floor , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as colour :
select the sub @-@ project and change the name for example in the pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , select and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish properties :
change the values such as in the following screen photos and click on request .
the settings of the box effect and reflection can result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metalli@@ sch is still not selected :
you should now have a good impression of how you can create and k@@ po@@ v@@ ist . hopefully you have already learned more than you to create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ .com is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture or a model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the difference between the perspective ( i.e. of the camera that reflect the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera . without a light source , you can see the scene where you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene you will see , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file , you can choose your file select . P@@ ov@@ ray files are usually the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
to open a file . in default file , you can select a file that you have before using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er :
always when you open a new model , select the file in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name , it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
the scene in the last stored version starts . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you have not stored in any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can only then select where you have set back .

a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to comp@@ ose rough surfaces , without any Beu@@ le on the surface is required to change without the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a d@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a text editor .
basic values are simple geomet@@ rical forms which can be used as a construction site : very complex 3D models are created from a dozen or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a realistic look .
a text editor is a way to give the surface of a lens color on pixel @-@ base , using a image file as a color card .

you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail address automatically ) and you will send a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program data are writing than U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a message , but this is not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right portion of ren@@ ame .
in order to keep the surface intuitive , the start window is converted into the statistics . you will find it under extras .
the meaning of this icons has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .

O@@ GG you can have an easy advantage compared to MP3 @-@ quality in low @-@ quality Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both co@@ di@@ ver is very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ it &apos;s not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will be delivered with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG @-@ play@@ ers is available .
MP3 - if music also belongs to other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo installations . today - beginning of 2009 - support these devices mostly just the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compres@@ sors for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting is a good transparency for most people and most of the most
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting is usually used for most people , and most of musicians are acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extremely &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less complex parts of the unit . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compressor rate about 5.5 . needs a 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ H &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR working stereo , compression rate , 11 . 128 k@@ bps connection for all pieces of a titanium . well gen@@ ug for all pieces of young people , portable devices and auto@@ graph@@ s equipment . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is used for most people and most environments .
the &amp; CD ; information that are stored manually or through the program are automatically generated from the fre@@ ed@@ b on the internet , in the program is available as a list of parameters . they can be transferred with &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; and the code program to create the ord@@ ner@@ - and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the code explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the sample ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame must be added , the switches -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; the result is so from : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; parameter which can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
that &apos;s what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , which can be downloaded from the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information within the computer .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not legal . however , no one can prevent them from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so I can &apos;t be able to get the artist on the CD ; more or less valuable , so you can &apos;t get to the artist nor the music of the music .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this type of configuration is used when using fre@@ ed@@ b can be used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address will not be used in the system ( This can only be used to know which code is checked . )
in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic on the next mirror server will save the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides an actual list of mirror holders for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during the read one &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
this extension program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to be installed in the source code .... This was always the best choice for the reading of audio CD ; it is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package have to be installed again when this is not done .
to save WAV files , the code can be selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ s ) and FLA@@ C ( an error @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab map to the inser@@ tion of the code .
the co@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the Basic Linux distribution before the code can be used before the code is required .
after installing a code@@ c , additional information can be received by the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; con@@ st ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write writing and readers on whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ G@@ s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD . check the sleeve and CD . this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give you how to go .
if you have read the complete manual , everything is understood , but somehow there is no problem , follow this step @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything and our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extremely &apos; using MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be installed as pre @-@ free pack@@ et for your Linux distribution .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of that you have an account ( eg ; by clicking on the con@@ quer@@ or something into copy ) .
the first section contains the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; , something which was only done once again and
the second section describes the action to read a &amp; CD ; what is done for each out &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the compression quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extremely high ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extremely = &gt; V@@ BR ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which is used to download the CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings , we will be able to change it very likely to read a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to read the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to read the CD ; data / pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom creates a symbolic link on the real device record . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to put the records of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
in our example , there is no need to be defined . here you can view an additional transformation . in our example it will be possible to view it as usual in the screen photo .
if you are interested in full details , you will be informed if you are able to inform yourself if you want to be informed about your request ( Tags ) .
the Kart@@ ei@@ card CD ; settings . simply install both entries . we are comfortably and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet of a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; with the Internet that he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second @-@ selection field is simple , a &amp; CD ; entry , starts immediately with the database entry and the file name , they can easily change the database or tag entries . the directory - or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ quer@@ or , and the ID@@ 3 tags attached with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example it is more to note : if you want to use anything manually , if you want to use the selection process and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can be selected with fre@@ ed@@ b in the offset mode , the two fields are selected to be selected at least the first . the mode will be created on the following cardboard card .
C@@ DD@@ B is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are Settings for the data entry , for the call &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server via the Internet . how to know the system which data will be found ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . download the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . download the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .

C@@ DD@@ B Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server in your proximity . this way the load is distributed between the computer . this setting is the first attempt to work .
both work is equal to the server as well as many fire@@ walls and protocol 88@@ 80 &apos;s protocol , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to the internet .
in this example , we do not want to use the CD ; data on the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
simply download the settings from screen photo . ( imagine that the folder / tmp on your computer does exist )
at the same time , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author white it doesn &apos;t try to try .
CD ; after all of the previous piece , please check this in order to throw the CD on the end of the process .
user defined folder for temporary files : if you are not specified , the path / folders will be specified in which the WAV files are stored in the private folder .
if you want to use it on the screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances it must be necessary to see anything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned , it is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting setting factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
if the entry &quot; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the creation of the creation of tags on Version V1 / v@@ 1.@@ 1st &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be mistakenly deleted . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of later change in tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of input file ( including full path ) and output file .
set the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use of this sample :
number of at the same time at co@@ di@@ ating WAV files : with a Dual@@ Core or Quad@@ Core or a multi@@ processor machine can be tried , more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just received the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oc@@ re@@ ator ; this configuration is selected as standard for every extension of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you &apos;ll never have to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of ext@@ end@@ able &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , it is described in previous section . the process of this section is described in the previous section . the process of this section is described in this section . the process of this section is described in this section .
as we have a &amp; CD ; use the screen photos a little differently than that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully of fre@@ ed@@ b ab@@ brevi@@ ations . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this sample is a &apos; special &apos; output of this hand@@ book .
if this is not done , you need to change the CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window will be listed in the window , such as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; you could be read and from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , you are looking for a section of questions and answers to the Help section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully performed by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of pieces are already filled and are displayed in the name of the artist and the album .
for the event that there is more than a entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; and you can select the database entry which you can choose from your opinion to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have the connection to the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ) settings , you can also trigger it manually by choosing the first Kn@@ op@@ fs in the tool@@ bar . if you have any local database , you require the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 1 : the CD Editor - input of the CD &apos;s data and the Tit@@ ans of the first unit
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the unit in the first line of input fields in the first line of input field &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be given more in the input field &apos; updates &apos; , unless you have a combination with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field may be used for the individual comments of the album , the commentary @-@ field of the album will be used for comments for the pieces of the CD .

firstly , you can open open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , which you can select the exact song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this works also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and pray to the button in the tool , select the entry to play from the menu item or do the idle screw .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you can draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid @-@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then be played on a collection . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece , you can jump to any place by clicking the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
if you find that a song about fast or slow down , you can change the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ dial . to maintain the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ x LCD .
the empty line has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button is played as a pressure on the button .
Li@@ ed@@ és can be stored on two ways in a music piece . some pieces also use text events , other use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ tu@@ des and again others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events will be presented and even better : the er@@ ection type will be automatically configured , so that you &apos;ll be able to change it manually . if you want to change the type settings , the kar@@ ao@@ ke text is selected , automatically the kar@@ ao@@ ke text is automatically displayed . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to adjust a squ@@ ad type , select from the menu settings to the entries from text messages or songs . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you play together . this section stands out how you can use the collections of collections .
to put a collection , Open Your collector manager . this will find out in the menu Collection under the point of organis@@ ing .... Click here to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection is included in the beginning the same songs contain as the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the scre@@ en@@ shots on the collector .
in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when ordering the application , this collection is not stored .
to add songs to a collection , she must be chosen at the collector . it appears to add a song on the button . it appears again the file dialog , which you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting tab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if automatic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is enabled , a piece will be added to open ( using the file or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Automatic button is not enabled , it will be activated when opening a piece it is activated and e@@ ert . this collection will be added to the pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you have to open the collector manager , select the collection and the desired song then click here .
you can select the order in which the songs are played by the sub@@ menu item from the sub@@ menu of the Menu collection , the songs are played in the sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or delete or random sequence in the menu , the order will be new .
to select a song , select it in the collector manager or use the selection list via the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump a song , select the button next song , the next song on the menu item or press the button .
to jump a song back to jump , select the button below the button below and press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , select the collector manager , select the collection , click on the button .
temporary collection may not be deleted . that plays no role as it will not be saved during loading &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not capable of General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI Map of General MIDI events in events that is syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that lets you change all events of type change to B@@ right piano in events of type change @-@ patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et . thus the trumpet is sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have a sound card , you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US maps , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps . you need to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite function ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that are all required to play a piece of piece .
each section can only appear only , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP -@@ section , which may appear so often . condition is that each occurrence is a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ less Entry System &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &gt; \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; \ &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see that a section starts ( except for OP@@ ER ) and END that the end of a cut is achieved .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can work in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible with devices that are not compatible with General MIDI compatible .
this section is specified , how the patches of General MIDI is depicted in your specific keyboard . the general use can see as follows :
please note that the GM patches are ignored in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , i.e. no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional @-@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to insert all the tones that supports this instrument with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can see a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , similar to a tissue .
when now you play a MIDI file a note with patch 127 ( winning ) , the patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file .
please note that there are another percussion instruments ( drum , basin , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not those who possess the sound level of the same drum means ( like him some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to provide such tones on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as at PAT@@ CH@@ PS section , the order of lines are very important , as well as their presence . you must create 128 entries .
you can define different names for each channel and each instrument of several key@@ boards . you must only be used in the first line of different names .
key@@ boards are used mainly used to create tones on the percussion channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to register for example the first and the second channel , you are simply simple in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP server .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the per@@ scription on a specific channel ( general MIDI @-@ channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ tools need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section is 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
if you are using the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must be defined in the file name for these channel . if you use the key@@ map using the name name for these channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events of this channel will try to change the patch on this channel .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to use the Per@@ c@@ ussions se@@ ams to the Per@@ c@@ ussions se@@ ams .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is multip@@ lied by the ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event , with the value n , this with the formula is * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , and then will only be forwar@@ ded to the value of 40@@ 96 is used in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM is a keyboard to play a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event with value 40@@ 96 , but also some key@@ boards to play two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve . to try the correct value to your keyboard , you &apos;ll try to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , you just open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings .
the channel series is a window with a whole range of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) .
you can also use the channel to change the channel to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed a tool , the button is not more green , but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel series has ( until now ) two different views to show the played tones .
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the speed of a deck . if you &apos;re looking for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the speed , use the arrows on the right and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about , like a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc .
well , I can force anybody with a mp3 file 4 MB , while a mp3 file 4 MB , you can change a similar sound quality . in an MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have the control over everything .
this can happen when you have a binary file ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support application , you need to install a source distribution and install ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage )
I would like to add a collection of a collection , but I did not want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all files , and draw them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to add the setting tab to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; otherwise the files are added to temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can adjust the arrow keys to the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the play@@ back . in order to recover the standard tempo to the LCD , you can switch to the LCD double @-@ click .
I have to play on one &amp; k@@ de ; work surface a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way , I would like to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) , and I change the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid file .
if you want to add a file to a collection without it to add to a collection , you can add the setting tab to add , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of added files .
if you want to play the MIDI files , A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ W. . you only want to play the first file . so make the setting tab to tab and open A.@@ W. . your temporary password contains then that a MIDI file .
then connect to B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid drop and create a collection with all three files . how do you do this ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post cards .

it is possible to create the preferred connections under the menu folders , but this are individual entries . if you are looking for a list of registered entries , you should use the following long play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archy , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and play@@ back .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . however , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player can also be changed by a editor , but also by the application itself .
after notice of XML files , it must be selected from the menu to selected using play@@ lists , or another category will be selected .
all changes will be lost if the machining mode is left or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the auto@@ graph from &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by pressing the XML configuration files .
the animation at the start and loading can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / dev / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ lists and notice from &#91; General Options &#93; No Name = 0 ob@@ ab Option auf &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily added .

for printing of a &amp; DVI , file , the same steps like for the document ( see ) . in the 7 step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed using the file ( in the viewer ) .
the tool bar allows the transformation of DVI and file in other formats . as soon as the DVI , file from the &amp; latex ; source text , the transformation can begin to start the transformation into the factory .

event actions are actions which be carried out when something special is happening in the project . an example would be the sign of the aper@@ ture and closing of the project that later , or having a message when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the C@@ VS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc .
on the event of event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the recipient to the list of selected address data . see how the address can be set up a team or sub@@ project leader .
comments are special Comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note : it can be used either the note @-@ entry from the Editor context menu or the _ not@@ ation key page in a language range followed by comment .
in this case the syntax name of the team will be sent to the name ( nick@@ name ) or @ An@@ not@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the team name of the team name of the team manager .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large , or small parts , but empty space around the brackets and the note : make the note is invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , D@@ TD is and web @-@ based form@@ atting and script languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are only more than &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in found .
the settings can be called Qu@@ anta Control ... to be accessed . this dialog extends over some pages that can be treated in each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car , can be changed . the entries are :
large / small documents of Tags : large / small parts of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / small parts means , the tags are inserted as described in the XML files .
large / small parts of attribute definitions : large / small bat@@ ches : large / small parts means that attributes are inserted into the attributes as described in the XML files .
optional Tags : if an act , it is optionally available for tags , for which the closing date is optionally available , this immediately after the &amp; gt ;
no optional Tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple Tags .
starting and departure day is automatically updated : when enabled , the respective @-@ closing day is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic transformation of ac@@ ryl@@ ate characters in the appropriate code during the inser@@ tion .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using standard default , the default values can be restored .
standard drawing coding : the coding of newly created parts or in other way as with file open files ( where the code is over@@ looked ) . this setting is used here , however , from the same in the project properties , if a project is charged .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ TD is not detected . this setting is used here , however , from the same in the project properties , if a project is charged .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates a backup of backup , so that this backup can be restored in the next start of the program . this is not the same as the saving file . also for stored documents will be a backup regularly according to the set time .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the preview and the source text at the same time .
set the window settings for the next start is useful when the user interface by changing the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / dependent on one another . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
warning messages -@@ area is the possibility of able to switch the display of war@@ nings due to non @-@ binding posts .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be defined by symbols instead of scripts instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ S and the source text view .

the FTP Location Manager window enables you to define a number of connections for use in the FTP Folder field on the Publish window .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for use &amp; gu@@ bed ; including ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it adds .
the use of Deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with the selection of a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin in the project settings .
if for a project a Deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitoring variables .
a view , in which all holding points are listed and listed are listed in the lower do@@ ck .
a view that is shown in the issue ( as in HTML ) of Deb@@ ug@@ gers .
depending on the supported functions of Deb@@ ug@@ gers , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this promotion , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if required , or they commit the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ ating demands . this promotion is triggered by default when a project is opened , which must not be paid in normal case in normal case .

sends a HTTP Status to the server for a Deb@@ ug request . this is equal to the use of a browser to view the current document .
the de@@ bug@@ ger is to begin with the execution of the script and information about the monitoring of the script and the current line . if this happens , the execution occurs before a debate is started to start the script with the requirement .
the de@@ bug@@ ger is to begin with the execution of script , without information on monitoring variables and the current Z@@ edge number . when this happens , the execution can be done before a script is given once a requirement is set .
Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads to the next assignment in the script without being able to go into the functions or include files of the script .
Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next assignment in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include the confirmation of error .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are there in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the CSS .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created by hand ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically by an existing D@@ TD . see below for details .
this document describes how to create an XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool accessories . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the Layout and the Content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ eller , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and then clear whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use it as many as possible to use other users a better overview and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes every element in the individual . everything about the possibilities and borders will be placed in easier way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML file . it can only contain only once in a document .
the type of tags is a script function . when using use &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of the function . ( only family 2 )

requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for detection of data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a method name . the arguments that is passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container tag allows the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is a only element of element element .
this day is empty for each attribute ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
there are the position and size of one field in dialog . this day should be available for each field in dialog . one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ;

to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools set up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . at present , check only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following a example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atically .
in the following example , an example for a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP is described in this file . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file will be re@@ load@@ .@@ day .

the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just quite simple and there is an editor for that of a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for one of a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new set &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be created an easy &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :

&quot; &quot; &quot; a action can set up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same dialog . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the same dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this action is defined by button @-@ button . with the button of the button , a button @-@ button can be assigned to a button . with a button the current button can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be given a text in the det@@ ective settings and the execution of action is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action @-@ type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually script , but it is not limited ) which can change the document or input ( or parts of document ) , but are the quick start @-@ dialog or the different list in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
in this way , you can &apos;t use the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / zoom / zoom in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / phot@@ oshop / jquery / api / index.@@ html / css / css / css / css / css / html / css / html / css / html / css / html / css / html / css / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / index.@@ html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / html / index.@@ html file in any text editor .
% f : we re@@ places the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the process is replaced when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script .
parameters for this event usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to project file .
in addition to the above specified methods , an script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection field , you can be determined to send the default path to the standard input . options :
selected text : the selected area of document is sent to the script .
according to the input , the output may also be led to the standard edition . there are two types of issue : normal output , on the default time@@ zone . it can be specified , which is set to be set to the standard edition by following the selection of the selection of the selection :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups .
as soon as a tool item is added , you need to add actions and configure actions . select the settings Biwak # 17 : wild Food
the parts of this thread are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Aktion Kn@@ op@@ ard at the lower end of the window .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the day to the suitable tools .
complete all and if the day attributes and you are planning to enable dialogue &quot; Tag &quot; if available , enabling an input to use the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ?
to create a tool@@ kit that the promotion is better , we will use &amp; ki@@ do ; choose the following programs ( or where otherwise it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ st ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22x@@ 22 . to change this , select the size .
please note that the same symbol does not only help you to remember what the promotion does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to the fact that the day start , I decided to create a start button as symbol . by using green ( green , it is usually considered as less , star@@ ved , further ) or should be asked to add a message to the user .
after creating the symbol , it must be connected to action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press button and set them together with other tags , so there are , or do you confirm with OK .
if you want to add some small &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for work@@ stations , or it should also be shared by some Tr@@ ul@@ ars in several groups . make sure that the required tools are chosen .
I would like to select the g@@ ps ( all left ) for my work@@ stations . after selecting the element , it should be added to the arrow keys to the right . this adds element to the tool to the tool .
I would like to use a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select and add it to the tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not know that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or button is the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new factory needs to be tested by pro@@ b@@ ating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
if new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your work@@ load ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please choose their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your work@@ stations will be loaded ( s ) , if a file is opened in the corresponding type .
maybe the chosen expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal users is the option to add documentation for the script language or form@@ atting language .
before you start your own documentation , you may check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language you need to leave the doc@@ r@@ c file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP , documentation as something :
Joomla Templates , Mod@@ ules , Extensions - Hot Joomla Templates , Mod@@ ules , Extensions - Hot Joomla
notice that it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
remember that the index is directly related to a file refer@@ enced ( and consistent on the upper end of the construction view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder ) .
empty spaces nothing but respect &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; resource &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the content of the doc@@ r@@ c file is to be displayed for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sql _ fet@@ ch _ array -@@ function should be displayed directly . there are only two kinds of entries here : the Cont@@ ext@@ List ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file permissions .
a simple list of been separated into the context elements which are available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c as well as $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / share / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / doc for local or global use .
if you are sure that this well and it is worth , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. the documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud of it to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tools , scripts , script , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places , there is an email that can send an email to email , how D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with an email or email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our head archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it as correct and used for the publication . to make a contribution to a message , we recommend to sign the resources to sign a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to add a new resource for your private G@@ PG key ( URL ) , or in the case you do not have to specify the input fields ( URL @-@ preview ) and click OK .
the high load can upload from the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) upload , tools and folder menu of files and folders in the templates and script tree .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , study &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the un@@ vers@@ atility of the resource by checking the integrity and the Sig@@ ni@@ zation .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is possible to work by a D@@ TE@@ P package . it is possible to convert thousands of day files in the XML format . it gives the simpl@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the menu D@@ TD and conver@@ ts a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description . then the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p .
Microsoft Stellenangebote : Event@@ - und Marketing Manager , Dream@@ Spark Academic Program , Bi@@ z@@ Spark Startup Program Specialist
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after transformation : if enabled &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity to use it .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it has to be familiar with these fundamental concepts such as their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is the labour market divided into three areas : global , locally and project related . this differentiation affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are designed for everyone who sets &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses the group of administrators with different tools , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements make a personal collection of web development products for a single user . these are user @-@ specific sample and work@@ stations . local elements are stored in user directory so that they can use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be done everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tools are specifically designed for the files of a specific project . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing pane , the building sites , with information and work@@ stations . please contact us and for further information on these areas .
you can click on the map with the right mouse button to delete a context menu with the current document , or re @-@ load the document , delete or load the document , jump to a bookmark or version of C@@ VS commands to current document .
in the editing area in the editing area will lead to another context menu about the processing of documentation , how basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing on the cursor over the mouse button or opening the file , if the cursor is referred to under the mouse cursor .
at the upper end of the Edi@@ tor@@ sion , the tool can be used as standard for the editing of the editing . &amp; HTML ; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
the use of work@@ stations is really easy . if you want to use a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , you can enter the data for this straight added .
the Bau@@ man@@ ometer ( Q@@ IT ) is possible to navig@@ ate into the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navig@@ ate , to open and sl@@ ate strips . in the display with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , sample , documentation , attributes and documentation of construction sites .
project management is a powerful tool that creates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project using the right mouse . actions like adding , removing , high load or delete the files from memory medium .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities to be open .
templates can be shared in three categories depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project .
here you can find information about the available templates in Global , loc@@ al and project work here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can use the available information to a script .
with this view you will see the internal structure of the active document . by the links to one element , the cursor is set to the position of the element in relation to the position of the element in relation to navigation and sub@@ sist@@ ence of the construction .
this tree appears under the other building sites . with him , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ ing rooms may change the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation for Web development for your development . it can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and create a folder documentation for a project .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cardboard boxes at the bottom of the window that can be used in the lower end of the window that can be used : the news window and the problem window .
this map shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . thus , e.g. the just used D@@ TD in the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this map shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts which are executed , all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ stations are extensive and easy to understand . they are displayed on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate bars are possible to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the ability to send a tool to send an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tools used as compressed T@@ ar archive about &amp; k@@ mail ; they can secure this in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as any other is secure and loading !

that should be an aid according to the environment of the mouse , but still not implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is free available and free , but as with every open source project , the developers can always support the developers . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial support you will find here the way .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be filled at the best from above to below , as for example , fill in the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . the input file name is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . default , it has the name of the project in small book@@ cases and without spaces with the extension web@@ g@@ j ( i.e. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ name is exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
to be empty this field , the default settings of the chosen settings may be used . depending on the remote computer , the default settings may be necessary .
that is the folder to be stored in the templates for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files used for various projects , these folders should be adjusted instead of the standards .
the folder where the tool can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects should be set to be set instead of the standards .
this allows to add files from local file system into the project .
this setting is great when you download static content , you can download and change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ y scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) must be different .
act , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started to re @-@ started , not a hook .
with this option , all files and folders within the main menu can be displayed and you can make a precise selection of vou@@ cher .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by using hooks or , by removing the port , brackets from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can upload your work in the menu with project properties .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in described . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which can be used for project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to top , even files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded during opening of the project . in can be read more about project lists .
for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
in the window profiles , you can set high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building plot for any profile by hand a own construction site for any profile .
in the window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event of event event , you can add the event promotions and add these actions , change or delete a event , when a particular event occurs , such as the Si@@ zes of a file . see the details .

to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project . the dialog project is displayed and allows you to open a project . projects have a .@@ web pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before departure , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files , if you load a new project .
project development gives free access to the files in the project . there can be managed in the current project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the entries are open and open it with the right mouse button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu : &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see different profiles . the profile contains information on the location of the uploaded files . see below .
this prevents the removal of the current profiles . if only a profile is present , the button takes the button to prevent the removal of the distances .
this option is useful when frequent loads of files is needed and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk is not possible in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply the dialogue , if you change your opinion from the high load .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loading profiles are created and so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded into various servers . in editing or create a profile , this dialog is shown :
this is the name of the server that should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address .
the transfer protocol for high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o Sla@@ ves ab . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator can do not have a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your order . the password is stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but each with programming knowledge can be easily found in the small text .
a project view is only a set of files and work@@ stations . it can be loaded in one project many views , i.e. through simple di@@ pping of the view can be loaded several files and tools , and replace the currently open files and tools .
in the course of the project or the project team can be re@@ achable on the project or the project team can be opened or deleted or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do with most of them . this helps to increase productivity and increase the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as already mentioned above , work@@ stations in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best on the menu tool can be used . use and Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tools &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tools and symbols on the same time can be set on using the context menu ( right on the tools ) , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified in the dialogue , which can be specified in the dialogue , which can be specified in the dialogue , which can be specified in the dialogue , which can be indicated on this or other tools .
due to the context of the context menu to a promotion ( symbol ) on a work@@ piece , the items will remove the items and show action that are self explan@@ atory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working on them can set the actions on them in the menu with settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates are used in the main datas@@ ets , code fil@@ el and files to the links . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates like a conventional fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces .
please read the conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template .

documents can be created by any text file . based on this templates , you can be created a simple structure for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient .
this type templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text range will always be added to the documents .
as the name says , serve this templates for all websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be arranged in a folder structure . currently there is no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Microsoft Internet Explorer security and privacy levels should not be higher than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( default setting ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as soon as that is done , do you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) , the template doesn &apos;t have to be stored in the project tree .
select the text in your document and click on the file as a template you want to save as local / project template . alternatively , choose the selection as a local / project template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only can be used in a pre @-@ specified folder . it can be used for use and insert via the file tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can choose the file tree or in the project files Bau@@ man@@ view on a folder , and ensure a name for the template and secure . default is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as local or global business .
project management enable a very targeted presentation . you can add head@@ lines and foot@@ lines with your PHP ; design , files , or associated with them . in addition , you can paste some things in the use of templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the functions of the sub @-@ folders in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / menu and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / share files . any of this folder corresponds to one of four types of container , as above .
to select the behaviour of a folder containing the right mouse button to select and select the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the parent folders . if a regular folder would appear to appear in this path , except they would appear above . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h with something like text fields . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably appear in a parent folder .
this could be general head@@ lines for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ lines for all templates for a certain project and enables designers to take a whole presentation with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
additionally , you are using the context menu ( to show right mouse button ) above a full command line for adding folders or copy and paste from one spot to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : v@@ pl ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which are accessible via the menu . the first mode re@@ places the source text editor into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it appears to be a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cursor can be reset to the source code editor in which the data changes in the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; source code is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; interface . to edit &amp; PHP , it is not possible to modify the source text editor . there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode does not work exactly as the first , except that the changes in the source text editor is also visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . with dr@@ yers from F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key to the active cursor of a window to the others , with the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta , ... After selection of V@@ PL ; -@@ View , you can set up between synchron@@ isation according to one click or automatically .
if you want to change the title of web page , you will change the title of the web page , so it is also called a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . it is used to create a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags attached the storage of information via the document itself , for example , using two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows to modify the content of the content , e.g. key issues on the column names and key password .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of the design of the pages in your browser . you can add CSS rules with the list of the list , or delete the list of the list is exactly like in the met@@ a elements .
it is possible to use an external CSS style template by clicking on the file button and choose the appropriate file .
the cursor is as usual in a text case , by cop@@ ing with the paths , possible . under rare circumstances it can be used as usual . the mark@@ ings works like usual . text can be inserted by inser@@ tion and deleted .
the Inser@@ ted Tags is done in the same way , as in the source text editor , it is to note that the Inser@@ ted tags will not be removed , e.g. if a An@@ ker @-@ day is inserted with text , each other will be removed .
some tools like the tables and lists are de@@ activated . they are de@@ activated later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists can be used in this release .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for analysis of style templates . in difference to other programs for Stil@@ ts , the search for specific elements possible and the design of the style can be pursu@@ ed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully do you need &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries no x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ xml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already exist .

&quot; &quot; &quot; there are many graphical tools to understand . why , &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; ? let me explain why I have written . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combination was very complicated because one of the figures has changed many changes and at the same time . another progra@@ mmer had changed in the same file much text . the result were numerous conflicts in the same file .
the program was changed to me , but I could not see what exactly within these lines had changed . and there were no indications regarding the places where perhaps only the impact of this changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning of the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ user ; the differences within a line and changes to white signs were added to any other useful functions .
if you want to compare to the example , copy it into the cli@@ pboard and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work , the list and assembly of orders . this function is related and diff@@ user ; almost in a fully @-@ value file browser .
also 3 @-@ ways lead is completely supported . this is useful when two persons independently of one piece of code and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to edit the differences between the differences and changes . in this Editor , you can even edit the result of the relevant changes . in this Editor , you can even edit the result of the relevant changes . this Editor can even edit the result of three Qu@@ ell files .
make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ user ; shows the exact differences of different colour monitors . if you have to check it frequently , you may like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that on a glance at the left side on the left side .
when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then shows the color on which file different is different . red colour means that both files are distinguish .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simply copy the file name of the first file . example :
deprecated : function ereg _ replace ( ) is deprecated in / www / htdocs / w00cec0c / webEdition / we / include / we _ modules / object / we _ listview _ multiobject.class.php on line 296
the open dialog allows manual image file to specify the selection of file browser ( file ... ) or the open source file from the main list . you need to be a third file , if you want to leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the difference with two files will be carried out .
if you select a folder , you can also select a folder , for B and C but a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A into the two other folders .
when mer@@ ged , the input field is active for the goal and allows it to change the input field . it is not necessary to set up a output file . you can also cancel this step later when saving .
you can specify a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before you start using the Compare .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text window . &amp; k@@ diff@@ user ; you will not have to select the text files from the intermediate window to the active comparison .
you can also set up and check out : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a comparison window .
which idea is behind ? sometimes , a file is for example multiple similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar functions are , that would be a relatively big effort .
note : currently , you can do nothing out of the diff@@ user . only the case can be supported by text in a comparison window .
warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the structure and insert the text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of cop@@ ying and insert ) . in such case , your original data are lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the signs A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows C is optionally available . ) Je@@ de Info line has a different color . ( note that windows C is optional ) .
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this pre@@ settings can be changed from the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you see different files . if both files are distinguish , the pre @-@ selected colour for red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . colour sh@@ ema is especially useful when you compare three files . that is in the next section ( mer@@ ged ) well .
in addition to the text , the column shows the appropriate colour . when differences are found , the column shows the appropriate colour . when differences between white characters is not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , the white signs are not so important to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful , only relevant to the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + ) , it is useful to see the relevant changes . ( at C
the vertical line that is interrupted by the text is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the tick is activated is activated , the line is displayed on the broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison of the windows ) also has a info line with the wording of the wording : the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ... &#93;
! ! ! ! to all conflicts have been dis@@ solved ! ! ! ( use the but@@ ors ski@@ ds to the ligh@@ test / un@@ fortun@@ ate conflict to find the remaining conflict in order to find the remaining conflict . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference must be resolved at the same time .
a click on the left mouse button in one of the window will be displayed in all windows , and the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows where the group will not be visible in the windows where the beginning of the group will not be visible .
sometimes through the automatic assem@@ ble or by manual editing , there will be no further line in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you will change your opinion and perhaps again another source . this text is not a place for the event that you may change your opinion and perhaps again another source .
the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling ; however , however , however , if you copy these text from the result window , then be careful with this function .
note : when using the sources the options are ignore or otherwise C / C + + comments are enabled , changes to numbers or comments as white signs .
navig@@ ating on the left , right , high , down to the left , right , high , down , side down , side , starting at the beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ start and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the eye of the eye you can also use the other keys to editing the other keys to editing the other keys .
a click on the left mouse button in one of the left mouse button is synchron@@ ized the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section and the edi@@ ble output file was explained ) .
the tools image contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / preceding conflict ( Ctrl @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / pre @-@ liberal conflict .
to copy the marking into the cli@@ pboard you need to copy the cop@@ ying button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Ctrl ) . there is also the option to copy the cop@@ ying button ( Ctrl @-@ C or Ctrl ) .
Unix variants are used to use the source of source files that are used to use the source files that are used to use the source files . the source file is not specified with binary files , and other systems using the source files .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved and stored in the next start . ( menu adjustments - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ usion ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also has a variable width to choose , you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c scrip@@ tures . if the chosen scrip@@ ture does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems using only 16 or 256 colors , some colours are not available in their pure form , but would be displayed . at this systems , the knob you will automatically set up an odd colour .
when this option is enabled , when pressing the tobacco button the corresponding number of spaces will be added . otherwise a tobacco sign will be added .
if you press or return , the inser@@ tion of the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be copied into the cli@@ pboard .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ame type you prefer to save . the corresponding value is the generally usual selection of the used operating system .
in this step , the second step can be ignored each line . the second step can be ignored each line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) Save an end line &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ ak &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then might be different from different sizes in the side @-@ side @-@ side effects , but they could be different from different sizes in the side @-@ side @-@ side effects , but how a white sign is treated . during the mer@@ ging this option is disabled .
this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and appropriate characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are still shown , but they are treated as white characters .
this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive and smaller differences . the option is enabled in default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow at very big files .
in the automatic forwar@@ ding mode , this setting is displayed as long as the result will be displayed before the next ...
automatic all conflicts in white signs using the selected file as source . ( pre @-@ set , manual selection . ) This is useful when the white character is used in many files . if you are not using a white sign in many files , you can use the functionality to be used in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignored C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are treated in the chapter to the scanning of folders and run a combination . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and assembly .
if a file is stored and already a older version , then the original version of the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version already exists , if there is another backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .
adap@@ ting to the user interface . the change of this option is not the current program . you must end and rest@@ art the current program . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally by the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry . if you activate this option , you will be used for all entries the top setting .
over the selection fields for the coding , a brief note that the local coding is released . ( this can not be changed here and has not changed for it pure inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this affects how special characters is treated and interpre@@ ting . since the coding for each file is adjustable , even files can be compared with different encoding and together .
if you have created a file , you can specify which code is used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , if your files are 16 @-@ bit over@@ code ) , but the processing command can set only with 8 @-@ Bit ASC@@ II . ) With this option , you can specify the code of the processing command .
you can turn this from to supp@@ ress the changes of changes in white characters in the text or comments . ( note : this applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or ignored C / C + + -@@ comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a colour co@@ ils are displayed . but sometimes you would like to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather than for long lines . Bl@@ use simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this option can be useful for each other in each other . this can also be useful for use of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and decide to modify the files . you will also have to install the file name and use the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the name name of the last source file , the name of the least used output file is used . )
in the reading of a file , it is visible to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut parts or to correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file , it is specified in this external command . if the command line is specified , the output is specified only when the command line is specified . you can write your own pre@@ processor which is exactly the option of the command line .
the idea behind the user is more flexibility when using the Di@@ ff results . but this is an external program , and most users want to program it . the best message is however , however , in most cases , or per@@ l will be fulfilled .

while you experim@@ ented with God , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even see this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ign@@ or@@ ate of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ out@@ . ens@@ ky &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; is a search , and every hits is replaced by nothing , so that is deleted .
sometimes you would like to perform several tips on once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the objectives of each one . example :
instead , you can also use something else such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / TOR@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ gies are needed in per@@ l some details . where age \ \ ( and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will result in the display and to result in operation . the further operations can change the data that sees the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ on @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use an ordinary Pre@@ processor , the option of the normal Pre@@ processor is used as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to be manipul@@ ated in a folder where many files can be manipul@@ ated with &amp; k@@ diff@@ user ; complete folders will be re@@ achable and together .
... makes a proposal to cancel the proposal , you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can the assem@@ bling process and displays the si@@ mu@@ c@@ ated changes without having to perform it ,
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is the list and configuration of individual files very similar . you need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if any target folder is specified , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder , folder ) , folder , folder , folder , folder , folders , folders , etc .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts automatically , you must start the respective menu entry or the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
during the entries of the folder you will receive a small news window on the current progress . if you delete the scanning of the folder , only the files were listed to be compared .
if the scanning of the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ user ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every file was found during the scan it is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually summar@@ ized by clicking on the + / - click on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ direc@@ tories and access all sub@@ direc@@ tories with which you can access all the folders .
if you want to double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison , and it appears to be a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the fil@@ et@@ ype on the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the fil@@ esystem type in the other folder , this can not be selected in the columns A / B / C / C and in the detail window . if the combination can not be selected , you will automatically inform you about problems of this type .
as in the above image , the colours are used in the columns A / B / C the colors Red , green , yellow and black .
the color , however , is identical , even if the age of the entries are different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use Add images from folder ... , Add images from Flickr ... and Add images from Photobucket ... to slider jquery options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of this color scheme is based on Haar@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colours of a leaf back , which is only green , then yellow will be yellow and later when it is old is red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if it does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C not the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B a file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types .
... A and B not the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B a file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder , and if the option direc@@ tories are synchron@@ ize , then choose the necessary promotion , so that both folders are identical . if for a entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical , and the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; directly after the mer@@ ger and diff@@ use ; B to A. )
when two folders will be enabled and the new file will be enabled , then the same date , then an error message : files are different , but the same date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange cannot be removed , the folder can not be started .
during the mer@@ ging , a file has been installed after the other . you &apos;ll see the status column when the combination was successful , and according to others , if it is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if in the installation , the file @-@ like method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 additional columns . these include the number of di@@ ers , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts is only displayed when three folders will be compared or summar@@ ized . )
you can either select the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ds ) , or all entries are selected on once . if you have selected all assem@@ bling actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run the combination .
please note : if you are not specified in the three folder mode , C as the goal is used when the two @-@ folders will be selected as a goal , and / or B as a goal .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries are displayed in the destination folder . there are some options by the certain items may be used in the folder structure . check this options for un@@ familiar surprises :
to summar@@ ize all entries : select the directory menu or click F@@ 7 ( the button strap ) . to select the current entry : select the current version of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the contradic@@ tory file types are still invalid combination actions , a message appears on the incorrect elements . you can then select a variant .
if you lead all entries , the dialog window appears on the options , simul@@ ate and break .
select if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
when a manual intervention is required ( together with a single file ) , then you will open a record window ( see the screen photo ) .
if you are ready with a file , select the directory to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; back diff@@ user ; its work with the next entry .
if the diff@@ use is a mistake , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you choose to select the cause of the problem .
if some entries were performed individually together , the diff@@ user can not change their entries in the current session . even if you are not stored in the current session , they will change this entries once again . only if you change the assembly promotion , this entry will again be changed again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now a section called the directory name called the directory name with these options :
only files that are shown on the specified sample , the sample will be displayed in the element tree . it can be configured with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; it is valid for example * * and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders are displayed on this pattern , do not be displayed in the element tree . it can be more than a sample , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separation mark .
files and folders are displayed on this pattern , do not be displayed in the element tree . it can be more than a sample , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separation mark .
ignored files that would be ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by C@@ VS ( see below : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some file systems , files are a sub @-@ file attribute . in other file systems , you can decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on .
in links to files : if the option is switched , symbolic links are compared to the links , the files are compared to the links . this is disabled .
links to the folder : if the option is switched , the symbolic links will be treated as normal folder . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated and re@@ strained . ( note that &amp; the diff@@ user will be treated as normal folder ) .
the complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ aries , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when they are applied to files that contain no text .
when you compare large folders on a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size .
similar as confidential . the files are considered as identical if they are equal . that can be useful when cop@@ ying the alter@@ ation date . please be careful when cop@@ ying the alter@@ ation date .
the synchron@@ ization mode is activated when two folders will be compared and not a target folder . in this mode the results are stored in both folder , and the results are stored in both folder . this option is switched off .
if there are differences , instead , the cop@@ ying of the ne@@ wer file is suggested as a promotion , because it is assumed that the other file was not changed . you should check it in any case . ) This option is switched off .
if a file or folder will be replaced by another folder , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ original . if a old backup file has already exists , it will also be a complete backup file with the .@@ original file . this is also the default setting . this option is in the default setting .
normally , the folder will be displayed in the setting of individual files ; you can switch the window with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to turn the window with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the folder and text window to switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double click . nevertheless , there is also a relevant menu entry . if you need to run a single file , you can run a single file directly .

K@@ DE supports network distribution network with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folder . in this way you can specify files and folder to view the files on local or remote locations .
the first command line indicates a local file with an FTP server . the second command line indicates a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folder . a few things should you note :
a path can be relatively . or .. included . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls .
for example , a file containing the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated if a link on a file or a folder . then a file is accepted as a link goal . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
it is not possible to edit permissions or change date of date . therefore , the permissions or change date of the original date . ( note the option of confi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main subject is currently being considered as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ ag@@ op . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP starts the built @-@ in viewer viewer . to rest@@ art the right mouse button on the differences and select from the context menu from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input file will be applied , the input file in uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program can be moved to the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file , and from the context menu preview of the context menu . please note that it does not work when the original files are changed since using the patch file .
if &amp; diff@@ user , it is supported only the list of two files , a very small work@@ piece and menu . the combination or Compare of folders will not be supported in the mode mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ ghtened es ) there are already in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ user can already be able to lead the program DI@@ FF@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use G@@ PL programs very long and I have learned a lot more learned in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone away .
you created the program from the sources of sources and the configure script , not the correct Pre@@ fix for K@@ DE . however , K@@ DE check the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines will be different as identical , if only a white characters is different , the line is not identical to each other , the line is not identical to each other , this is not identical .
the editor provides for every difference in the files where he begins and ends where he ends . it is necessary to take a conflict easily by clicking into the source text and stream of the Kn@@ op@@ ener A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is easy as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design this information .
the effort has to be too big . you can always restore a certain version of a source A / B / C . in order to edit a certain amount of text that should be used to edit a other editor .
after the removal of text , suddenly , No src lin@@ ens ; released and the text can &apos;t delete . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many different colors for their differences . even more Her@@ mes would be conf@@ using and is missing the purpose . use it for another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature set of all virtual environments . it is quite practical to view the ongoing programs on the work areas to change their size , they end or move it . this works both within a working surface than in several .
the &amp; p@@ p@@ ager ; can all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the running applications . the applications can be selected and even moves on the work@@ space and to others .
the middle mouse button can be moved inside &amp; p@@ p@@ ager ; moving the movement is possible within a working surface as well as other working spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is left , the context menu will only appear on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the context , and the name of the application as well as the name of the application as well as the items of application , maxim@@ ize , on work surface and loading .
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the work@@ space . it appears only when using a application .
send the application to selected virtual work@@ space . it appears only when using a application .
with the middle mouse button , the window will be moved within the &amp; p@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the work@@ space and also to other working spaces .
if this field is selected , the name of the virtual work@@ space are displayed .
this field is designed to display the &amp; p@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . it is together with name , the name with ordin@@ ate numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working surface .
if this field is cruci@@ fied , the background of each work area is also shown as background in the &amp; p@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is selected , the ongoing programs are indicated as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise it will only be displayed on the empty working spaces to allow their choice .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ ecke with the propor@@ tions of the program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here you can see the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main menu will appear : classic , &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster , see all the virtual work@@ spaces in a vertical row , which is very good for the display on the working surface .
the &amp; p@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . he has the advantage that it can be changed in the size , the window as symbols or with their content .
click on the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and you can set the dialog to the dialog settings .
at the moment it can &apos;t be changed in the dialog settings . you can do this but manually :
to open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / dev / config / k@@ read@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; k@@ ite ; or VI@@ C . if you have any typ@@ ing for the file , you must contact the key win@@ dow@@ ant mode and for this one value . possible values are :
since &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is , you need a functional installation of the K@@ DE basic package .

this application is also interesting for different users . this application is interesting for different users : the artists , web designers and people with a visual certificate . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; it is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding the new functions . it is optimized for use on powerful computers .
if you are &amp; k@@ mag ; start a window such as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag will be displayed as a magni@@ fying window . the image , which is shown in the magni@@ fying window , is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to below as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse is like a mo@@ vable L@@ upe . alternatively , you can select a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse cursor on screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cursor in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor . please note that the cursor is not in the position to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor .
in the selection field mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse button and change its size . this can be done on the following way :
move the mouse cursor over the magni@@ fying window and stop the left mouse button , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fying window , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fying window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in addition to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain firmly locked and can only move the lower right corner .
&amp; lt ; it has a lot of functions . you can send the magni@@ fied picture directly to the printer , in a file type , insert into the cli@@ pboard by it later in other applications .
start or stop the upd@@ ating of the display . the stage of entry causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , average , High , Very high ) . the higher output rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a selection window is displayed . the selected section is shown in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; uses a new window to save files , opening a new window , printing , zoom ( with the button document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlar@@ gement &amp; comp@@ actors , etc .
this application is also known as &amp; k@@ asser@@ tive ; it can be used for different people of benefit : from the research and artists to Web@@ designer or artist to Web@@ designer or tend@@ on .
for more detailed user documentation , you can either use this URL in the address bar from &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , or start help@@ center help : / k@@ mag .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same position . it is meant to help people who suffer on the RS@@ I syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ rays ) and where every mouse click the pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same spot . it is meant to help people to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tion . it is also a little exercise with the mouse . this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; allows you to use the pain during clicking on the mouse , and helps to use the mouse pain without pain .
in order to set it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pain will help to use the mouse , it is against pain that can be used by means of the mouse . the result can be used for each differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click the movement as soon as you break the movement .
the mouse button is activated by pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , waits it up to the end of the movement , before the mouse button ends up to the end of the movement , before placing the mouse button .
this verse time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click away .
the mouse button is assigned to the mouse button ( 1 / 10 s ) .
this function is activated in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / dev / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but they can later be changed later .
if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the reaction time , click on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider . there is a sliding bar buffer for you to sh@@ orten the response time to sh@@ orten the driver hours .
if this function is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; for every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently available under &amp; k@@ de ; please click the respective documentation to find out how you start a program automatically .
sets the settings on the values to set the dialog when opening the dialog . have already done the button , the settings are set to turn on the stand after the final wires .
at the same time , you can set up the intelligent head@@ light to get you first . if you want to use the automatic mouse click on the automatic mouse , you can download the intelligent head@@ light .
if you use the listening click , it is necessary to decrease the driver times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effects : clicking on the neutral density of windows or places on the browser window , which does not show the mouse at such places , until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is clean , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse only , but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse to mouse . how this happens , is about mouse to mouse . it should be clear , when you view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you should see the wheels . these are located on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was used . the Dre@@ ck and dirt cannot be easily removed with a flat blade or the fingers .
in very rare situations , the operating system of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when it was started in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the operation cannot finish .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is to run out a mouse click . thus the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set , and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter the text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the cursor to a different position .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place the cursor on a neutral area of the working space , if you want to have a touch of mouse to a neutral area of working space , if you don &apos;t want to make the mouse on a neutral area of working space , if you don &apos;t want to drive the mouse to a neutral area of the desktop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with the intelligent pushing , but I did not know it to edi@@ fy the text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intelligent control is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to select which you want to fix it into the cli@@ pboard or any other action .
use the intelligent delay if you are just starting to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click on the mouse button down the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and the mouse button .
the mouse button creates a sound like a mouse button . so you know exactly what when intelligent pushing the shift time begins . later , you can use the intelligent distortion without the listening mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
in order to install &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Review extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most system .
functionality of the listening mouse cursor is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ ting the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short . this program was developed for people who suffer on RS@@ I syndrome and that the mouth of the mouth is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can be configured so that there will be a certain period before the mouse button is left before the mouse button is carried out . this way can also be done with the mouse .

to understand the work of film , it is important to know how the program &quot; Speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; different four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be drawn up for all other entries and holds these orders . if the output of Screen reader is read , the left orders again will be res@@ orted .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; a warning has a warning and holds the output of messages and nor@@ mal@@ es . these orders will be back to the issue of warning .
messages can be used for an application that can be used for an application that can be used to use . for you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site , you can find a long text on a web page .
the rest are simple text messages . every order you have used by the card orders , a text book . K@@ Say@@ it is an example for a applications that have text messages . text messages are intended for the edition of longer texts , which have no particular care .
all four orders are working in waiting days , with the exception of Screen Re@@ aders . if one use the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre@@ read , this output is recorded and ended .
first you need to know that filter will never be applied to the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders . you will apply to regular war@@ nings , messages and text messages , as well as &amp; k@@ de ; News .

for example , if you are looking for example on the map or depending on the program , the text on &amp; kt@@ ops , sent to a spok@@ esman for example on the map to read a female voice , you can read the text by K@@ DE messages .
each of these different filter has an adjustable rules , according to which he may not apply for a language output . if the filter sets that its rules are not applicable , he gives the text itself unchanged to the next filter .
if a text or message , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ ons on &amp; kt@@ ops , it will be created by all activated filters , the processing of the filter is done in the order within the list from above .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ iel@@ l@@ center ; , the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the contro@@ vers@@ y center ; allows users to manage the management of a series of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ iel@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting the K menu and contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file was developed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the users a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ iel@@ l@@ center , shown . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the contro@@ l@@ center ; internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ fz .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware does not install . physical devices and their drivers need to be able to install and configure it , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf can be installed and the setting of network qualities enables you to create and the setting of network qualities .
in most cases , drivers are added to the network hardware and other devices for the network hardware and other devices in the Inst@@ alling &amp; Linux ; the driver must be added to the following files , according to the following files , according to the core @-@ version , :
the module network settings is loaded if the network settings in the &amp; k@@ iel@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index of the module , is selected to automatically detect the platform on the system .
if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the suspension features are offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the Treas@@ ury .
the change of the network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are shown , which means that the settings can only be viewed , which is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access to the system management mode at the right end of the module . it &apos;s the input of the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three languages :
the rider network interfaces to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices can be carried out with the following tasks :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set to set the settings in the list and click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button in the list and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button for the dialog with further options .
this allows the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP servers will find all necessary TCP / IP information at every system , so it is no further setting . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system , the TCP / IP address can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection manual it can be installed without any D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP for TCP / IP address . in the input field / IP address you must specify the TCP / IP address . in the input field network mas@@ ke is the sub@@ network mas@@ ke .
if the initi@@ alization is marked , initi@@ alized the network interface when the initi@@ alization is not enabled , this option is not enabled .
the specified values are displayed as the properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network . the input an already existing IP address would be used to connect to a TCP / IP address . you will notice if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network is asked to be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched off . in turn off the network device is enabled by selecting the list and click of interface .
network devices can be enabled or switched off . when activated , an activated network controller is done by selecting the list and click of interface .
the IP address of the computer located in the local sub@@ net that uses the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gat@@ eway computer is selected .
a calcul@@ ator with DNS support will be able to understand the entire IP address . it is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is only IP addresses , it is necessary because computers can only understand this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
you can add or modify the name of a listing solution for a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be accessed through selecting an agreement or exchange rate in the list with the buttons or in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is added to the list .
from the group computer you select a name and then click the button to Edit the Edit button .
the list of these well @-@ known computers describes computer @-@ IP address specified for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server .
normally , the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ators , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are still replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click on the dialog box .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the button . if the well @-@ known computer has several well known names , de button add several times and indicate the further domain name name .
select an evaluation from the list and select Delete images .. The dialog is accessed .
it can be done one of the following tasks then by clicking OK , the list of static string will be updated .

you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
for installation of binary distribution channels ( mostly rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommend@@ able for less experienced users . it is easy to install the rpm package and in one &amp; setting , with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with a graphic interface such as k@@ pkg or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally , the development of development with libraries and others are required .
this will be recommended for experienced users . it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapters will be important information on basic network value , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed .
this area can continue to replace IP networks . in this context , only basic information on the integration of the PCs in a small ( home - ) network gives you a detailed information about the integration of the PCs in a small ( home ) network .

one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , the network can be accessed from a network interface or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used in any way , if the IP address may not be chosen in any way .
when using a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose , to avoid IP address events with the global ( internet ) network .
of course , the access to the Internet for such machines can be supported by adjusting of a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .

&amp; k@@ dat ; it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a band . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band . the second goal was the answer to a question that my wife said : how much longer it takes it if you are assured ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ inal the band back and read the pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the band . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ fix on the band will be asked if the band shall be form@@ ulated .
det@@ ecting &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ann is looking for the right index on your plate . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the belt index is newly created .
if everything is smooth , the symbol is part of the band , to show that the band has been integrated into the status bar . the content of the belt can now be accessed through the entry of the band .
in front of the band , the band must be resolved at first . there are three methods to increase this .
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration of the band was solved and shows a appropriate message .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ ulated by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band types have to be form@@ atted correctly before you can use to save data before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be done before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; this process can be done before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ;
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the band are lost , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before using the backup process , you have to select the backup files . that can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be secured this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . it will only be secured only in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a ports . only the files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
click the right mouse button to select the local file tree and select the menu .
as soon as the backup has been started , the dialog settings can be used for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog is the dialog . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the Archive for the drive . it will be checked for selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in one of the Archive for the band with a har@@ k@@ chen . it will only be checked files and / or sub @-@ folders .
click on the right mouse button in one of the Archive and select the menu entry ...
as soon as the test procedure was started , the dialog Settings dialog appears to check the dialog settings . in this dialog you can check your selection and check the folder folder for checking .
if you agree to check the settings for checking the dialog . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can be used , the files must be restored , the files may be re@@ manufactured . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the post office . it will only be restored to selected file or sub @-@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives using a ports . it will only be restored to the files and / or sub@@ folder .
click on the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the Archive and select the menu .
as soon as the reconstruction process started , the dialog Settings dialog appears on the dialog for restoration . in this dialog , you can check your selection and check the work@@ Folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears on the dialog . this dialog shows the progress of the reconstruction process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the tape to select the tape file from the band . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can select the index on two types of the band :
this is a backup profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can specify the following settings :
the current job folder in which the backup will be automatically updated . the list of the saf@@ est files will be automatically updated according to the selected desktop folder .
for all folder that are listed under backup files , the files are stored on the same file system , which can be installed on the same file system , you can register separately under backup files . each entry is independent from the other .
perform a ink@@ able backup . to determine what files are changed since the last inc@@ re@@ ment Backup , you will be using the files that have been changed since then .
the name of the file that is used for the statement of changes since the last inc@@ tion .
del@@ eting the s@@ app@@ hi@@ ps file before the call . this causes all files are secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup file .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to add image slider .
the full path to the device file ( normally / dev / wire ) . this path must be used to the non @-@ re@@ use version of the tape unit .
if this setting is active , or k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated into the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the extension to lock the belt drive . possibly this setting is not working on all belt drives .
if the option is enabled , it is switched on when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , automatically the band . use this option to flo@@ ppy Pro Stream@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , you try to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ working block size for the belt drive . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your belt drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ ist , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should be a storage block on the band . the content of the file is as follows :
( n byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character is the name of the system : seconds , with the name of the complete name of the system , the number of seconds , which has been form@@ ulated since the epo@@ ch has been form@@ ulated .
the band @-@ ID will be used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure animal @-@ Archive which can be accessed directly with &amp; GNU .
check the content of a backup belt . this symbol is only active if a band is integrated .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;

in addition , &amp; gt ; experienced users with fast access to information about problems which can occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system ; try some advanced functions , with their help the protocol of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 owns and k@@ system log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ s@@ log server and Samba
many other functions are also included in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions are available with the help of the individual protocol lines of a protocol file , and set the individual options for sorting and fil@@ ming will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start &amp; # log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system protocol . it will not be displayed , and it opens up with system protocol . the protocol files can be found under Linux / var / log , for the normal users usually usually have to read .
you can also use the filtering bar to filter the filter tool@@ bar to filter the selected filter . the list of the log file will automatically be shown in the default filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also choose another entry . select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder in the protocol . select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can choose the name of a process , so you will be sent to the name of a process , so you will send you &amp; un@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which are sent by this process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors will be displayed with an eye @-@ catching colour as protocol lines of the level . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to view a certain process ( for example in system protocol or in C@@ ron protocol ) , you can fix the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful if you would like to investigate the output of a particular command like to start the Samba server .
in addition , you can activate the new lines in the context menu of the main menu to allow all the new added lines .

&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V in@@ it editor , rather known as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; but this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V in@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go forward to historical aspects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ it binary file is located under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . it is therefore important because someone might try to take a machine on the system V in@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ form@@ atting .
the sy@@ s@@ v in@@ it distingu@@ ishes itself from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are in sub @-@ folders directly in / etc .
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service that you would like to start your system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; transmitt@@ mail ;
r@@ c.@@ local should be part in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it is actually not a lot of use for you . you can also make a r@@ c.@@ no in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for various places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can see a look at the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ defined Run@@ level 3 is correct . if you want to change , then you can manually execute it / etc / in@@ it@@ tab of hand . if you want to modify the in@@ it@@ tab changes , you can repair it by using the system to rest@@ art the system :
but how can it happen to all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l @-@ l @-@ l @-@ r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the fol@@ ly :
you will notice that in this folder there are no correct files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
as starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? just simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is a argument like start and stop stop . you can actually start this script in hand by hand on the command line as follows :
this would be the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it means the name , and if the K includes the script , the script will start with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with argument .
some people would like to set a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could also have a server -@@ Run@@ level that could only be htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; transmitt@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program has been created so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is easy to say not to say tri@@ vi@@ al : take a result from the range of the available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to run it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts from Run@@ time to move or modify the position within a levels by making it different from his original Run@@ level ( or his position ) , this is only if they draw a entry from the field of the available system services .
please note : entries are subject to copy this in a new area . to select them only to a new Run@@ time , you must specify it from the menu or from the context menu to select from the context menu , and then if the same entry is already in the target area of action .
the Sor@@ ti@@ as number of an entry can be calculated sometimes . in this case you need to edit the sorting entries before you can try to add the system service .
please note : currently there are no possibility to restore the transfer into the paper basket . be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different working areas ( availability system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous versions .
to move a entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ pboard ( you can also use Ctrl ; X use ) and add it into the desired Run@@ level with Insert ( with Ctrl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or names of one entry , press the entry key to change the Properties dialog . use the key button to accept the properties to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes .
due to the danger of data loss require all entries in the menu file an confirmation before they can be carried out .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ O / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are stored in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if they are available from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; re@@ manufactured . changes to the settings are stored in a local sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have to step back with the standard Run@@ time and experim@@ enting with the machine , and now starts the machine @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t # single and press the input button to start in the single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default time@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be included in order ) .
I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not carried out .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( d@@ ld ) then you have to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in this distribution list . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the Art , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary entries in this distribution , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are provided that are required by the respective system service ( and even if they are located in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache / htt@@ p@@ d ) is simply without any message if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level variable from distribution to distribution , can even be different to version differently . if you use a different distribution , please send us more information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be included .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the Chapter Modification of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you have to save these items . either use the appropriate icon of the tool or entry into the File menu .
the main window is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and the user . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some card cards will only be displayed when you have extended system settings . if you want to activate the system settings , you will be able to add a cardboard card , if you have an individual settings , if you have an individual settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to password ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this card game will only be enabled for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem provider ( quot@@ a ) and initi@@ alize ( quot@@ a ) and initi@@ alize ( quot@@ a ) .
these parameters can be set individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system .
the card @-@ card group is informed about the selected users of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs to the users , you can find in other groups by selecting this in the big field .
the dialog features the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Properties from the menu or group or click on the appropriate button of the tool .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ Manager which add the boot password , remove the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , change and more .
