<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery firm of the world, has some interesting statistics, which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to solve the problem by CDs / DVDs, you can also find more than a few years. of course, you can also find more than a few years. of course, you can also find CDs and DVDs in archive quality.</seg>

<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not too much easier, the devices with computer chips and high-speed processes are different. these can cause severe damage, hardware chips and other defects. protect yourself from unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power plants is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of energy storage absorbs and the rest.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should look at the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure to protect the protection against flashing, and thus protects the correct devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage each cables can be connected to your computer, you should also be connected to your system. this is also possible for phone lines and cable modems, which can also be connected to your system. other offer connections for the coax cable of cable modems and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">A wide range of these devices are designed specifically for emergency and therefore very small and you also included the protection for the modem. thus you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">During an overvoltage protection of your system before smaller fluctuations in the electricity lines, it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of unilateral data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a lower power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices allow them to store these devices when a power failure. this gives you the possibility to store the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>

<seg id="200">Your free memory is limited to 1 GB, and you will not want to get your images in full resolution online. the professional version is available on 1 GB and you will not get your images in full resolution. for 25 $per year you will get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">The data protection is very secure. transmission errors are automatically controlled thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies it contains a backup and distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">This is why nobody tells you when a transfer error occurred in your hardware. it is quite unconditional that it should not be destroyed by one day. it is quite unconditional that it would have no protection to you.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power components are a further source for transmission losses, as they generate interchange within data transmission. normal file systems remain unresolved.</seg>

<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG files, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation reduces the image quality, since then the image data is more time for troubleshooting and insertion. if you have a fast machine, you can use this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option of TIFF files, you can switch the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF image. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it has no influence on the image quality because of the DEFLATE.</seg>
<seg id="299">Even if you are unable to save the loss of quality loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata was not supported, but in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">You can drag the images (folder) to the gallery jquery jQuery Gallery window.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard annotation is that all the green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option to use this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option is a little soft, eliminate the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white off the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only when the White is not set. standard is a fixed color balance that has been photographed on a white card which has been photographed in sunlight.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool represents five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions of normalize, automatic, automatic and contrast from the menu of Corrigieren are automatically transferred from your color. they will need to experiment with these effects. you will need to look at the best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method is scalable to change the luminance of the entire picture so that the dark dot is so bright as possible. this function is often a Magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">This is a very powerful way to improve the contrast range of the selected image, so that the difference between the intensity of a picture, sometimes also produces a very good results for improvement in contrasting of a picture, sometimes it produces a very powerful surgery that can either be used either in a picture or in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color area in the rotation, green and blue-channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminance of the RGB values of a picture through the lowest possible and highest values on the greatest possible range and a new jibation of all values. this is only visible when viewed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White came from & digicame; it is a half-automatic tool to carry the white abound of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance sheet is a little more limited than a color with 8 bits per color. if you can't perform the white aboutings in the raw mode, if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which can be used in 16-bit mode so you will be able to make your possibilities for correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">You can drag and paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider.</seg>
<seg id="397">The display mannequin can be adjusted to size. on the left side, the original image will be adjusted to the original image as well as the preview of the tool. if you want to see the original white settings, then click the original window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The goal of the destination photos has a red marker. the Luminator of the pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the right above, a histogram is displayed when you change a parameter. this script is very helpful, even in good illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminanzees. you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shade, saturation and gamma.</seg>
<seg id="401">With the above mentioned controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. click on this button and then somewhere on the picture to use the colour temperature of the white balance. to this type the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white papers with the list of the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overlap indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel. this will be displayed as a color channel. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">To save time and store exactly this. every setting of the White recharge you can save you in a text file and then load it again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button extension sets all the filter values again to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white abouts. note that this can be a different photo as your original. if you save this type, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can also use the Kodions depth per colour channel. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality pictures, but can also be used for the formats of PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog such as the processing of tube images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. a detachable instruction for use of color profiles can be set up to the use of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool offers an integrated way to store multiple color channels and allows you to save your settings for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner is always on the same mistakes and you always will always find the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct issues is the tool for gradation that you will find under colour gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"" "the" "" "tool box" "" "allows you to create a solar cell effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon effect and a canton filter." ""</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar cells, also called Sabatier, a effect that was created by the additional light. it had the effect that the light areas are darker and the colours have been created by the second lighting. the result was a partially negation of the image. this tool allows you to use this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controlled the solar cells. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemicals is possible. another increase is finally a negatively image that does not create photo on photo.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar efficiency effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied number (2). the applied intensity is at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The paint filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for his smooth image structure. Velcro provides very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasting colours. Velvias is very saturated coloured colors, especially those which have hardly ever seen landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasting edges. the parameters level control the brightness of the results, and the rails return the thickness of the neonlight.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras have frequently problems with light conditions and it is therefore not surprising that you are able to change the different colour effects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colour.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you do not get a photo in bad lighting conditions, you can reduce the right problem to increase the saturation instead of it. all changes you can carry out in the preview. if you like the result, you can check the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Due to the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchance / contrast / gamma is the tool to improve the quality of sound quality. even if the dialogue is very complicated, you need for the field of use in the area of the Schieber.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a grading of intensity values, a histogram, the active ridge, or the selected range. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move to move and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the image will be seen on the left, on the left side of the picture, on the left side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scalability: with this selection box can be set using a linear or logarithic Y-axis. for pictures the large areas of a constant color is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic calculation is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones, and the lower part of the middle tones, frequently called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three dumbbells can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input values of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selecting manual values for each section. the compression values can be used in order to change the output values, e.g. for instance, the compression values can be used as background as background while something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: using this knob you will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store and load: with these buttons, the set values in file system can be stored and loaded later. the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you want to use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values automatically adjusts the colour pipette, and then click on the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the Histogram for Rotating, Green, Blue and Luminescence channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option to set the option to view all color channels, in order to find clear pixel and allows you to view the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not the effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the input of the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is made with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side the half of the originals and the target picture. the preview will be updated on the right side of your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications: this selection box allows the channel to add the channel to the channel:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this cheese, there are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move to right turn right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that this bright tones can see that this bright tones with dark functions and the related image pixel will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red mark. if you want to change this mark on the field, you want to change the original line on the curve, the original value is displayed on this line and move a point on this line and move the value to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can make sure this. each curve is saved and the file format can be stored and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to use this method and the three colour pipet shows automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, central and sunrise. activate the color pipette to set the control points for the rotation, green, blue and Luminanzche.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option to check the option to view all color channels in order to remove the pixel. if in more than a channel overhung pixels, you get the combined result. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not the effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black white photo that has been corrected in the Luminanzees. shadow and sunrise was applied with the colour pipette and the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The canal mixer is a tool to improve the color channels or color shaded photos of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The canal mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the pictures. you can edit it from the menu of the channel.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the colour of the channel with the channel. this gives you a first note that you can be able to correct the relative distribution and change. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison via its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the destination has a red marker. if you use this in the picture, a vertical line in the history appears to show you the appropriate colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: control for Red, Green and Construction allow you to modify the corresponding colour components. this is especially practical, if you have to keep the corresponding colour components, as the channel mixer then enable you to develop the corresponding colour components.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochonflow, the reduction of a color on a visible noise that comes from the colour to the colour channel. if that is the case, you can reduce your monochet conversion to the same position.</seg>

<seg id="489">The filter unblurred is a very good tool to remove grinding from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help the image. the preview of the filter displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameter, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be sure to increase the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents a number of pixels on each side of a ridge by the filter.</seg>

<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw has much better than the Gauge's circuit. the Gauge's circuit has a very long tail, which leads far from the original pixelines, which leads far from the original pixelines.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular detection: this is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images should result in the standard 1 good results. you can set a higher value when your image is very unsharp.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation can reduce the correlation of 0-1. the correlation can be selected from 0 to 1. the correlation can be reduced from 0 to 1. the correlation can be reduced to 1, & eg; 0.095 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the sharpness of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilters: increased value of 0-1. however, values of 0-1. however, values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the smoker filter can be low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad. a high value is still polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius of Gauge's sharpness. use these parameters if your insufficiency is to avoid. if you have a value of zero, you must also increase the correlation and / oderthe noise filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrimal size: this value determines the size of the transformational material. if you have chosen large values for these parameters, especially if you have large values for these parameters. in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving load and load capacity will be used precisely for this purposes. any number of refraction parameters can be set up for later and can be charged safely.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cuts, color and intensity levels on the image before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before using the image above. the reason is that much operations changes are not immediately visible after you can leave the way later.</seg>

<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter settings, you can use the rider Glendable and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailhandelsasp [0, 100]: this is the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even more homogenous regions of the image.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional keys, Alpha [0.100]: a small value smooth in all directions, while a value is close to one direction, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this is the maximum flap factor over all. p defined then the relative humidity. add this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Control: [0, 100]: this parameter applies to larger structures. this is necessary if it is difficult when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want a 'van Gogh' Turbulbs effect, it should be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Renunciation: is often found on how often the algorithm will run away. normally, 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">If Alpha is selected as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropy Alpha. if Alpha small is selected, you should also choose that small angle is a long term. you should choose this value so much is possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stepper size [0,1, 10]: integral pre-size in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel spacing and never bigger than 2.</seg>

<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter and can be paired with the image and the color in it will be smooth and therefore smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: the sharpness occurs. this value sets the pixel spacing on the filter to the front in front of lightest changes. you need to adjust the edges -Filter, if you need to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can't be found and smoked up again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response to the sharpness. if he is too strong, the frequency response may occur, if you don't want to loose the whole space or JPEG or JPEG format you want to lose it without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Fluorescence: the fluorescent resistance of the image. we recommend you either colour or lighdensity to improve a picture. these settings can not affect the smoothing process due to the details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controlled colour-tolerances of the image. we recommend you either colour or lighdensity to improve a picture.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controlled the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas that typically be stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controlled insertion of the phasenjitteret. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of the fluorescence. if he increased to high level, smoked and Phasenjitter will appear on the edges. he can remove them and is the recommended method.</seg>

<seg id="643">In advance, you can change the size of the right by clicking the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which is defined in dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the mold of the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross format. in the high-format it is always the larger value of the height and the cross format of width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool belongs to the aspect ratio. that means that it is always equal to whether you centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo opier and its lateral positions.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons are automatically horizontally horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can cut the range of the range for cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool belongs to the aspect ratio, its settings are depending on the size orientation (horizontally or vertically). if you are using the cutting tool, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data is added to the picture above and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the program help enable assistance so that you can improve your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">The harmonic triangle: harmonic parts are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-regel, harmonious triangles are an option to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal stage.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus Much or the Blades leaves on a sunflower.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used in the old Egyptians and the Greeks that use your temple and pyramids in all times when you use your images, buildings and even photos to form a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">1: 1.618 the golden center is 1: 1.618 the golden center is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition is generally considered as visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center represents liquid feed available when you are a picture. these help are below are recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring your goal good results for your photos to achieve your photos. in comparison to third parties, the golden eagle produces a liquid line of the viewer. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the Spirale and create a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the right angle of the golden eagles, also called golden rectangle. it should be something that the eye can be used in the centre of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this is just because its eye can only be done without the eye, it will meet its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">In contrast to harmonic three corner points, the middle of the sides of the golden eagle. note that, in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal to these lines. Diagonale to these lines can be part of static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are called golden triangles, you create an effect of professional photographer dynamic Symmetry. try your image foils on one of the cut points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options are reflected and vertical patterns can be used to reflect the harmonic division.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines are invisible. you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn an image to turn any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it happens easily, the camera is not vertical or horizontal. this generates a picture in which the things are out of a angle. you can also repair it with the & amp; you can select the tool and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the Schieber angle. the values in this sliding settings are available to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation is a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor to the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image. now, you can drag it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, you can drag the angle as in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">You can drag the images (folder) to the corner where you can drag the images (folder) to the corner.</seg>

<seg id="1042">If a picture with only a rays of pixels can arise from different errors. these pictures have often found a fashion patterns or stucco effects in curves and lines, but sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this error.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray of pixel. this technique is called super-Sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; support two methods of the super-Sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-rekursive method; adaptive because each pixel is still split and adaptively because each pixel is always ready and adaptively to the calculated colour of the calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method to set POV-Ray a Straw per pixel. if you set the difference between the colour of the pixels, then both pixel is calculated by the persecution of a certain additional number of pixels with super-Sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Statistics: posted by betabug at 18: 25 | Comments (0) | Trackbacks (0)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The rekursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values the pre-given threshold then the pixel is divided into 4 lower pixel, the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted to the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility of aliasing effect is the production of noise for the Strahl process, called Jitah. if you turn Jitanya, change & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to leave a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can adjust whether the Alpha-channels by POV-Ray will be calculated. a pixel is transparent when the corresponding rays are no object.</seg>

<seg id="1077">You have just just & Povray; and & kpovModeler, installed and now you would like to follow any responses to the two programs. if you follow any steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginner's popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should be carefully checked as a result as a result is just a black screen. if you use a 3D programme for erstening, you should specify this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set any camera, no rules can be applied for the renders, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you want to add a light sources, your whole scene in the dark and you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything you have installed, see the first start of & kpovist, following the following window:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the workstations. please read the documentation, so that you can expect a reasonable idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will be able to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovist; starts with a simple scene. to follow these instructions, you must select all objects from the object tree. select the scene and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model overview shows how the camera displays all the scene you create. especially notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene of the camera. this shows the result of the Renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on, see the content of view properties, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found in the user documentation & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change the basic settings of the camera, but note that you can change the camera in the control points you can change the camera in the view. click the left mouse button on a control point and draw it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or input, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene out of the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are lots of ways to create the ground for the scene. you might want to add a quire to the scene, and size on x = 100, y = 0, z = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a permanent method to the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovist; it is actually a simple way. you can use an infinite level than the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button. in the object tree is immediately displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model-view shows the level when even at the moment only as a restricted level. if you drive the scene, the level until the horizon is up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object of the object, you will notice that you can see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something special.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue, in which you can select, as the object will be added to the object. you can see the names in the self-view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments are only a thick black material, because you need to enter the look at the pigment. do you always remember the colors of materials anytime with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see the colour on quad and ball, click on the button and call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correct. if you get your picture with a click on the icon, you should receive the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Here you can also find further settings. here you can also find further settings. here you can also find two new attributes. then use this entry twice (you can also be more frequently asked, but the chess board game can be used only with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree sitting hours and change the colours in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be easy to run, because you have to create the fundamental position of & kpovist; it is just as simple as the floor can create:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties, you can change the settings for the radius: on 1 (forget not to press the input line or button button), so the sphere of contact with the ground. otherwise the sphere can be moved on the floor, because you have the ground around a unit after the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the renders is a strange thing: as already before, the ball surface is like a thick black material. do you use the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball you can now see a material. as already in the floor, enter the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the sub-project and change the name for example in the pigment. click on ball pigment, select and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values such as in the following screen photos and click on request.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of the box effect and reflection can result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metallisch is still not selected:</seg>

<seg id="1522">'--preset extremely '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less complex parts of the unit. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compressor rate about 5.5. needs a 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>

<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the code explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the sample (English: day), if MP3s with lame must be added, the switches -tt of lame and the title parameters of & audiocreator; the result is so from: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameter which can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freedb is: a free database, which can be downloaded from the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information within the computer.</seg>

<seg id="1651">Temporary collection may not be deleted. that plays no role as it will not be saved during loading & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not capable of General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI Map of General MIDI events in events that is synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that lets you change all events of type change to Bright piano in events of type change-patch to Trumpet. thus the trumpet is sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have a sound card, you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible (including Awe and GUS maps, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps. you need to edit the appropriate file of hand (with your favorite function).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that are all required to play a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section can only appear only, except the KEYMAP -section, which may appear so often. condition is that each occurrence is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "this is a" "" "Keyless Entry System" "" "... &gt;\" "" "&gt;\" ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that a section starts (except for OPER) and END that the end of a cut is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can work in future versions of & kmid; support can be compatible with devices that are not compatible with General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is specified, how the patches of General MIDI is depicted in your specific keyboard. the general use can see as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the GM patches are ignored in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, i.e. no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional-keysTo M is used to insert all the tones that supports this instrument with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (e.g. with sound 60), you can see a drum (e.g. with sound 60), similar to a tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1664">When now you play a MIDI file a note with patch 127 (winning), the patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that there are another percussion instruments (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not those who possess the sound level of the same drum means (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to provide such tones on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As at PATCHPS section, the order of lines are very important, as well as their presence. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define different names for each channel and each instrument of several keyboards. you must only be used in the first line of different names.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly used to create tones on the percussion channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to register for example the first and the second channel, you are simply simple in the CHANNELMAP server.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the perscription on a specific channel (general MIDI-channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-tools need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section is 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">If you are using the Keymap option, the Keymap must be defined in the file name for these channel. if you use the keymap using the name name for these channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events of this channel will try to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful for example to use the Percussions seams to the Percussions seams.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is multiplied by the ratio of Pitch-Bender event, with the value n, this with the formula is * (r / 4096), and then will only be forwarded to the value of 4096 is used in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is a keyboard to play a Pitch-Bender event with value 4096, but also some keyboards to play two tones up to one octave. to try the correct value to your keyboard, you'll try to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, you just open the dialog MIDI Settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel series is a window with a whole range of pianos (one for each MIDI channel).</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel to change the channel to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed a tool, the button is not more green, but red to show that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel series has (until now) two different views to show the played tones.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the speed of a deck. if you're looking for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the speed, use the arrows on the right and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about, like a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can force anybody with a mp3 file 4 MB, while a mp3 file 4 MB, you can change a similar sound quality. in an MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen when you have a binary file (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support application, you need to install a source distribution and install (for example of kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a collection of a collection, but I did not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. open the folder that you want to add in & Konqueror;, choose all files, and draw them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"" "" "" "you need to add the setting tab to" "" "tab" "". "otherwise the files are added to temporary collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can adjust the arrow keys to the Tempo- LCD, to slow down the playback. in order to recover the standard tempo to the LCD, you can switch to the LCD double-click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have to play on one & kde; work surface a & Konqueror; -windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this way, I would like to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a karaoke file), and I change the file into the window of & kmid file.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to add a file to a collection without it to add to a collection, you can add the setting tab to add, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection of added files.</seg>
<seg id="1692">If you want to play the MIDI files, A.mid, B.mid and C.W.. you only want to play the first file. so make the setting tab to tab and open A.W.. your temporary password contains then that a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then connect to B.mid and C.mid drop and create a collection with all three files. how do you do this?</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "results appear ordered" "" "by relevance" "" "or" "" "by date" "" "(publication date)," ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation. for example, you can now see in the & PHP, documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062">Joomla Templates, Modules, Extensions - Hot Joomla Templates, Modules, Extensions - Hot Joomla</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice that it is not posible to insert more than one slider on the same page.</seg>

<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, tools, scripts, script, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places, there is an email that can send an email to email, how DTD DTD package (DTEP) with an email or email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our head archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download it as correct and used for the publication. to make a contribution to a message, we recommend to sign the resources to sign a GPG / PGP key.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you exit jQuery Slider, you'll be asked if you want to add a new resource for your private GPG key (URL), or in the case you do not have to specify the input fields (URL-preview) and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The high load can upload from the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP) upload, tools and folder menu of files and folders in the templates and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, study & quantaplus; the unversatility of the resource by checking the integrity and the Signization.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not created by & quantaplus; it is possible to work by a DTEP package. it is possible to convert thousands of day files in the XML format. it gives the simplest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD and converts a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description. then the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and full benefit from & quantaplus; it has to be familiar with these fundamental concepts such as their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; it is the labour market divided into three areas: global, locally and project related. this differentiation affects a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are designed for everyone who sets & quantaplus; uses the group of administrators with different tools, actions and patterns in the global tree, which can then be available in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements make a personal collection of web development products for a single user. these are user-specific sample and workstations. local elements are stored in user directory so that they can use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be done everything from & CSS; patterns to tools are specifically designed for the files of a specific project. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing pane, the building sites, with information and workstations. please contact us and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the map with the right mouse button to delete a context menu with the current document, or re-load the document, delete or load the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">In the editing area in the editing area will lead to another context menu about the processing of documentation, how basic processing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing on the cursor over the mouse button or opening the file, if the cursor is referred to under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the Editorsion, the tool can be used as standard for the editing of the editing. & HTML; _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</seg>

<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that creates & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project using the right mouse. actions like adding, removing, high load or delete the files from memory medium.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities to be open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be shared in three categories depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available templates in Global, local and project work here. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can use the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view you will see the internal structure of the active document. by the links to one element, the cursor is set to the position of the element in relation to the position of the element in relation to navigation and subsistence of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other building sites. with him, manageable attributes and naming rooms may change the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web development for your development. it can be pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and create a folder documentation for a project.</seg>

<seg id="2349">In the reading of a file, it is visible to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example to cut parts or to correct the insertion.</seg>

<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced by another folder, then the original version will be renamed and receives the extension .original. if a old backup file has already exists, it will also be a complete backup file with the .original file. this is also the default setting. this option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder will be displayed in the setting of individual files; you can switch the window with the mouse. if you don't want to turn the window with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the folder and text window to switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>

<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effects: clicking on the neutral density of windows or places on the browser window, which does not show the mouse at such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is clean, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse only, but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse to mouse. how this happens, is about mouse to mouse. it should be clear, when you view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you should see the wheels. these are located on the sides of the Loches, into which the ball was used. the Dreck and dirt cannot be easily removed with a flat blade or the fingers.</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is to run out a mouse click. thus the status of & kmousetool is set, and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter the text, try & kmousetool, the cursor to a different position.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place the cursor on a neutral area of the working space, if you want to have a touch of mouse to a neutral area of working space, if you don't want to make the mouse on a neutral area of working space, if you don't want to drive the mouse to a neutral area of the desktop.</seg>

<seg id="2957">The V init develops quickly to the standard for control of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "" "" "I will not go forward to historical aspects." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is located under / sbin and not under / etc. it is therefore important because someone might try to take a machine on the system V init, without a new installation and reformatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysv init distinguishes itself from the BSD init that the configuration files are in sub-folders directly in / etc.</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service that you would like to start your system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & transmittmail;</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be part in / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it is actually not a lot of use for you. you can also make a rc.no in / etc / rc.d if you want to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for various places according to the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can see a look at the second column and probably find that the pre-defined Runlevel 3 is correct. if you want to change, then you can manually execute it / etc / inittab of hand. if you want to modify the inittab changes, you can repair it by using the system to restart the system:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how can it happen to all the correct scripts? if you enter -l-l-l-rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the folly:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no correct files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">As starts and stop init actually system services? just simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is a argument like start and stop stop. you can actually start this script in hand by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would be the httpd server. init means the name, and if the K includes the script, the script will start with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people would like to set a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could also have a server -Runlevel that could only be httpd, & transmittmail;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program has been created so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & sysv; with a mouse or another hand device is easy to say not to say trivial: take a result from the range of the available system services to one of the six Runlevel to run it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts from Runtime to move or modify the position within a levels by making it different from his original Runlevel (or his position), this is only if they draw a entry from the field of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Please note: entries are subject to copy this in a new area. to select them only to a new Runtime, you must specify it from the menu or from the context menu to select from the context menu, and then if the same entry is already in the target area of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Sortias number of an entry can be calculated sometimes. in this case you need to edit the sorting entries before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Please note: currently there are no possibility to restore the transfer into the paper basket. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the different working areas (availability system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous versions.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move a entry into another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it into the desired Runlevel with Insert (with Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or names of one entry, press the entry key to change the Properties dialog. use the key button to accept the properties to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the danger of data loss require all entries in the menu file an confirmation before they can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEO / share / ksysvrc. pre-settings are stored in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc), if they are available from & ksysv; remanufactured. changes to the settings are stored in a local sysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have to step back with the standard Runtime and experimenting with the machine, and now starts the machine-resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt # single and press the input button to start in the single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default timelevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be included in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have made some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (dld) then you have to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in this distribution list. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The Art, such as system services in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary entries in this distribution, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are provided that are required by the respective system service (and even if they are located in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache / httpd) is simply without any message if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel variable from distribution to distribution, can even be different to version differently. if you use a different distribution, please send us more information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be included.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the Chapter Modification of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save these items. either use the appropriate icon of the tool or entry into the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user and the user. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards will only be displayed when you have extended system settings. if you want to activate the system settings, you will be able to add a cardboard card, if you have an individual settings, if you have an individual settings.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "how to password?" "" "" "" "how to" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card game will only be enabled for at least a built-in filesystem provider (quota) and initialize (quota) and initialize (quota).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually adjusted for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card-card group is informed about the selected users of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs to the users, you can find in other groups by selecting this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Properties from the menu or group or click on the appropriate button of the tool.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-BootManager which add the boot password, remove the default operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, change, change and more.</seg>
