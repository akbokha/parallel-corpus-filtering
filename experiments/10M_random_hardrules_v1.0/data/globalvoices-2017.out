although I visited the USA for at least once per year , I would like to live in the first time there .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily large .
as many of my generation I have grown with American films , I have read American music , American authors read and read his sport .
indeed , this country had a profound impact on me that I was mainly because of a American film journalist .
as 14 years , I saw the great D@@ enzel Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terri@@ fied repor@@ ter with the help of Julia Roberts in the Jura @-@ Stu@@ den@@ tin , who wanted his interest to his interest , that he wanted to put his interest in his interest .
I was caught .
free according to Method Man , &quot; me was it as if that is absolute truth , everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year I was living in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA only . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have lived , whose diversity is so , that you can always find it and it is easy to find acceptance into a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had even had a very rich love story about his size . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many has been written about the leaders and rac@@ ism of this man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 13 million votes he won the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number that reached one of the party in the party .
I was speaking in language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans who support this poor person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not know Tr@@ ump and his sel@@ ector did not know with the people who had learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ o , Director of the journalist &apos;s program , the people from around the world , a deep faithful man , with whom I could talk about the Islamic and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had made us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surprised at Sandy B@@ ahr , who lived for their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my family family who gave me how their son treated me as their son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet she doesn &apos;t fit to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , always with a lot of patience and grace me and my colleagues gave us to the complexity of the American life .
then there was Andrew le@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much with my career .
these people and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of them will deep@@ ened my love to America .
in the Tr@@ ump of his way to the republi@@ can pre@@ siden@@ cy of the presidential election , it took me a hold and the oppos@@ ing of his limited vision of America .

could it be that this vot@@ ers are likely to have the control over a country because they want to win the control over a country that they have disappointed ?

the music that played on both locations , not only the life of children has changed , but also a very tight connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large g@@ hosts , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; one old colonial city , which is very popular among the tourists , but worlds from the nearby land@@ ed ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now the La Bar@@ cla@@ de music ( musical ban@@ de ) found in the church : one of the children and adults of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchest@@ ras , which has found a possibility to over@@ over@@ over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students is interested in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the po@@ or@@ est provinces of Mexican , is known for its drug abuse and the ban@@ al violence .

the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :

more than 7@@ .000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village , which is practically above the largest air@@ line of As@@ unci@@ ón in the Capital capital - based on instruments that are made of recycl@@ able waste material :
music with recur@@ ring instruments that are made from local solid waste materials are made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a where the recycling can turn into the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ pregn@@ ate violin , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guitars , flute , trumpet , trumpet , trumpet , trumpet and percussion .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ette and Latin American music , as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in a article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local scientist and music teacher of the Children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , at the initial time :
first of all , it was very difficult because we had no place to the samples and we had to contact the same position at the same time when parents did not contact music and it was very difficult to contact their parents because many of them do not live with their children .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
today , there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments from recur@@ rent material and which The recycled Orchestra is called .

this post was written by Emma Bry@@ ce , originally by En@@ si@@ a.com , published in En@@ si@@ a.com , published in an magazine that is targeted at international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
in the framework of a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , a cooperation with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship already worked in li@@ beri@@ an waters of illegal fish , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were spread over and little inc@@ lined , a leg@@ is@@ cher of these type at their bre@@ asts are welcome .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the comp@@ ors , Mos@@ ambi@@ k , and the Sey@@ ch@@ elles mobili@@ se itself quickly against the ship . they refuse to share a fishing permit , also to share it with a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister was surrounded by countries that you simply did everything in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ motif of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is part of a team that was discovered and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship then went out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish for fish .
this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hyp@@ othe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month .
the core of this initiative , the criminal case was cruci@@ fied and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar for six countries , which had died at the Prime Minister in their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have eight countries , which are equal and together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Foundation En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught , is extremely difficult for it is extremely difficult for it is extremely difficult to date .
due to the estimated abuse of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and types are protected , the illegal hemp ecos@@ ystem will have to balance a DE@@ LI@@ K@@ AT@@ ES balance .
but during the actions against the illegal fish@@ eries were hin@@ dered by bureau@@ cra@@ tic femin@@ ist , and also by the Schn@@ eck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions and the actions on the F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .

this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark the ships of the authorities . this means that a ship will point out that a ship will point to the fish on other ships .
in the ide@@ ologies , such investigations can show whether the ships have a fish fan@@ ati@@ ence where they were on the way , and possibly even if they have a Stra@@ fre@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that means that the ships can not sell such ships in their har@@ bours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that means that ships can not sell their cargo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up to significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fish is no longer worth@@ while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , the director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ kel@@ eton , who supported the fight against illegal fish@@ eries in Africa and also F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a closed front &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Front &quot;
the already @-@ known platform was created to win a 20 million USD of lost revenue , which will lose its eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of the illegal fisher@@ men who did in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the productive forces of t@@ una fisher@@ men , that the region &apos;s commercial fish from around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actions should include actions like the sailing under fal@@ scher flag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream Voy@@ age , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; protected species and fish in nature areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the missing international collaboration and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ exist@@ ential control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ m to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now working in front of the front .
F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations .
it has failed economic networks that had been distributed and distributed in Tanzania . it discovered ships that were used for several frau@@ dul@@ ently identity and it has been pursu@@ ed and found murdered vessels .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international association for the fight of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i information on illegal fishing can share and receive great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far away in the networks in the network organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system which should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to double ships .
photo cour@@ tesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps to hide the illegal vessels that would be happy to hide .
&quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position .
some of the ships allow for example their automatic identification systems , which they cannot be used by sat@@ ellit@@ es .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information on each other . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours to get a better picture of what is - that &apos;s simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is an opportunity for countries to unite and maintain its resources to the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts announced a similar project with a global system for persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crime , but they also ab@@ hor@@ rors .
ships who had previously worked without license and hardly able to assess consequences , they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the F@@ ISH @-@ i countries now has a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats more licenses .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we have to copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a Study Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars by illegal fish@@ eries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries came together with the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with security , the goal , even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s young@@ est member membership : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that had been allowed under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was still in the waters , which are reserved for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the use of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , who are a strong sign that they go against illegal fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but this is not the history of Luis Pri@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who has been indic@@ ted in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the dis@@ ability of a 10 @-@ year @-@ child .
no , this is the history of Luis qu@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced a boy who had experienced as a boy who had experienced in a federal court against his own father .
his history shows what great power of a parent and how this child has chosen a way of rede@@ mption .
from the sp@@ orth@@ alle to the military base
when my father began to bring me to the military base , I went often in the sp@@ orth@@ o . there were my boys with a young boys , the mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone named him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you are a girl , you &apos;ve got you with one of the ERP link . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be in order . for this was my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the military , I had to destroy the prisoners who had heard the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all possible documents : university courses , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda and books , simply all .

the prisoners covered the prisoners
my father took me a total of four times by La Perla in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me on the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he told me to rise to me . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , cool@@ ers - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little in a ceiling , and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large piece of silver .
at this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects have been taken , and covered me with a leg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly turned into an open space and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prisoners covered the prisoners .
I sp@@ rang up and saw a li@@ ege , on the man .
they saw like a field@@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cab@@ s . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just found there .
they f@@ ences a man with hand @-@ held in bed , over@@ cast him with water , and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 volt into the gen@@ it@@ als .

years later , when my father was under house arrest , was the same smell of his room .
I knew the smell immediately and me was clear that the smell of a body in need is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do another so much suffering ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were spot@@ ted and were carried out and carried out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lopez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civili@@ zed which was also charged in the process ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people with the face of the face - all were on hands and feet .
close to the entrance of the entrance to the matt@@ resses on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as my father , I realised that I said to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you do so , I am looking forward ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you see me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and by soldiers killed and buried in a pit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that because my father said to at home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there a man together and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survi@@ vors of the Zi@@ vi@@ cian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who has been indic@@ ted in the La Perla Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .

the way on which you come here are also the way to pass away here .
if you look at the map you see that they were about this path and then for the first time .
their names were changed and they were received as part of the process of the human rights .
the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came .
this was the lie - the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the realis@@ ation of man and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .

&quot; &quot; &quot; my father brought all sorts of possible things with home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war be@@ asts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - how they called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later in the military , I was in G@@ endar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps militar@@ ism , which one has fought for an enemy .

many Japanese companies have no employees with English as native language , translated into English as native language , translated into English as native languages , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , Japanese , Japanese .
some companies who have no foreign employees have been created . then the Japanese employee is to be able to make English skills as the best way to the translator - no matter how good or bad for their language skills are really like good or bad luck .

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where it was not together with family , who lived there .
shortly before she returned to the university , she returned to the house , and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was treated in this house as a daughter .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta , you will be forced to work more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls to work in order to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money covered their min@@ ig@@ old son or her min@@ der@@ old daughter to another , rich family . in thousands , the child food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean , is that the children must be paid for countless days of work , which will never be paid and sacrific@@ ed of abuse and abuse issues - and all that is in the framework of a contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on the one hand , the family that their daughter in the faith that she has been able to improve their position in society and &quot; something from itself &quot; to another family .
on the other side , the family who justi@@ fies the girl in himself , and its exploitation with the faith that they receive a chance that they would have no training , and maybe even hungry .

in January 2016 we started a relatively unknown phenomenon which takes place in par@@ bor@@ row@@ ed in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an country , but a face .
as a Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , showed their body of traces . briefly , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of former militar@@ ism , Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as officials at the top of the office .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra long as long as a rod on Mar@@ ín .
this should be the last order in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media over the incident .

organizations such as UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ist society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern form of sla@@ very . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest against protest and asked that there was no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photographs were widespread in the social media .

without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control the conditions of boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the Eh@@ ep@@ a@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organisations have challenged a serious investigation of the case .
they want to become Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder on the girl who was sentenced to 30 years prison .
if the case has come to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín took place during the first time in the history , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go against court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas will not only be used as a workers , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ rar , in which their Father has been worked , and to sign her father to her father .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her brothers had to work and started to sell money on the street or to sell money to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they went to school .
only Tina became sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a between four and six hours each day .

when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time for learning .
ever she was finished with the learning , the more leisure had them .
but this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had never hungry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to get more books from the library of the household . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is possible to do this to do so , that could be a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or money .
the compl@@ ain@@ ant that consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs across the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ on@@ esi@@ ons and text . &quot;
it is unc@@ lear how the law is determined when the draft shall not be imposed upon the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in the position of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the regulation of the social media company .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ brevi@@ ations Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and Förder@@ er of the Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password by the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to create a fire@@ wall on national level in order to be able to submit information about their identity to their identity to access the network .
but it is not known that such plans exist .
moreover , it is an important part of the technical feasi@@ bility of the technical feasi@@ bility of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Foundation for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egypt Initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion it is so important that as they were violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I take them seriously , then this means that they are a strong surveillance system to protect citizens , or not . and this means a backward system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them a court process .
this is technically possible - but in Egypt is all possible .

six years later , the industrial re@@ building was far more difficult .
during almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ agi , there are only 30 percent of fisher@@ y fishing ports for their operation .
the T@@ sun@@ ami and the atom@@ ic accident , have drawn into the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land with a great place .
Mi@@ y@@ agi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agriculture in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of agriculture in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atom@@ ic question is , for only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed the country of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nu@@ c@@ coli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also intensi@@ fied their attention to the position of the ev@@ ac@@ ulture from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima , not only the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating T@@ sun@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also the worst of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic dis@@ asters that had to experience Japan .
from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ ed from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people have been in areas outside the Pre@@ f@@ ecture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent replacement plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the cat@@ astro@@ logy , most of the ev@@ ac@@ res are most likely to return to the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ agi , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games to take place in Tokyo .

the People Greg@@ ory Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I , which is located in the western part of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar - known , un@@ avo@@ idable that there are no n@@ enn@@ ing sugar .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were laid .
after the yield , the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory was lost after and after its facilities , until the structure of steel and concrete remains .
about 272 workers had to be re @-@ found .
some changed the work .

he heard that it has been in the east of sugar cane factories , which were in operation after long in@@ active time in operation because they were preserved .
that was something what he did not expect .
n@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I the sugar cane fabrik , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry remains the pl@@ ague , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced quantity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message would be a few decades ago a motive for the country , but the poor peasants are no new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the smallest of sugar cane industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar cane goods were technically possible and hardly percep@@ tible to the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories to focus on the annual product line of 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories to produce the sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euros ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the motives that led to such measures , the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the allocation crisis on the world market .
nonetheless , the sugar price before approximately one decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by 2017 until 2025 , the price of un@@ refined su@@ gar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report published &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the production of the level of 2001 would be reached ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export turnover amoun@@ ted to 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything was good
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day &apos;s day will take place with safety in the history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that were the first words of the Cuban president of Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since it started the process of the restructuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the st@@ agn@@ ation of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people received their full attention for training .
the same happened in the sugar cane fabrik Greg@@ ory Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al I am 14 May 2004 .

all were of uli@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could withdraw any compensation .

after two years , the People Greg@@ ory Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I understood that many things are changing , but not always for himself , when a factory is closed .
as the sugar pipe factory , or better said , they started when they started to asph@@ alted , they were also ro@@ oted to asph@@ alted .

we must not only do the faces of those who show the fear of the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , dis@@ solving and citizenship .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in HO@@ CH@@ R@@ IS@@ I@@ KO areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from ta@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her post reminds us that you should never look as normal as normal , whatever form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been looking for a few years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to newspaper every day and see the Tit@@ els@@ ons with images , which can only appear from a teacher for criminals or from experts from experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes I am feeling when I am the one or sad . it works as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot be even valid or this as normal .
write a review on this product .
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year old c@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is great . and it is not normal that people listen to the &quot; hel@@ ical &quot; of the bul@@ bs when they go through the streets .
for me it is that they would have the people who have lost someone , and those who have fear that they are so something happening .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ close of 43 students can be justified in a neighbouring location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they try to talk about such &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tragedy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they do not stir . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four months ago , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four months the pres@@ ump@@ tion of the main city authorities : like a family with threats , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how a family with threats had been arrested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a family with threats , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only the business , but also their families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pain is never done , the trau@@ ma will remain high when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed from each other , the better .
they made their report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested for others , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been asked me to solve if W@@ einer my deep@@ ening feelings would be done , but the name is no , for I have forgotten how to live with the pain . I must learn to live with the pain .

the false meaning of the picture and event - the wrong description or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - it is not the fact that there are plenty of careful review of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it is , however , questions to our desire for messages to messages .

the event for the attack was also unknown , but the armies of the armies was to win a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am and the attempt to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the image from the DR Congo returned to the fact as evidence of the fact and the possible scale of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people found two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ sile use of the image from the DR Congo is only a series of mis@@ ci@@ ci@@ ation ; Africa Check the regulations of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was brought to mass kill@@ ings .
a step forward to personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in context to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange was also taken in conjunction with the fatal persecution of mus@@ cular cru@@ el Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash out , the United Nations is described by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , ra@@ pe , and some dead , some by burning .
while other of the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported that I had to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this image is origin@@ ated from a su@@ di @-@ Arabic part of the 2012 , the President of Hon@@ egger Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians would have said the image from the DR Congo . in addition , she had to use the image from the DR Congo to use this information .

in all these cases , the picture may not be published after the original article of 2010 , the picture may possibly be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that are going to draw these messages . the first Frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims , or to defence of Christians - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as .
a second cargo is used to discuss such as an African life in comparison to a European or French life .
religion is to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it &apos;s worth@@ while to examine how images are used in connection with this effort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens when reading this picture is not longer a longer faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are people who have to avoid acci@@ dental care of the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of the error and Fal@@ sh@@ information that the actual animal did un@@ true and decor@@ ate it the actual Gr@@ ater of what actually happens in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images was founded in detail ( here , for example ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a argument is that it comes back from a female failure to recognize the tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the concern that violent images and spect@@ ators have to feel the ability to perceive Emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , which has been sought to help others like violent media to help others ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very important role in the news media in the intelligence community , F@@ act said that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will have to think about the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a picture must be seen in which a picture may be used in which a picture may be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any investigation also should be taken into account of any investigation , but should also be taken into account as international .

a blog with the name of un@@ publication ( for example ) , language course offers a selection of words from the world to offer you difficult or not to translate them .
such words are in every language : they are familiar to certain situations or feelings that often are often complex or specific .
some of these un@@ familiar words are well known as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deep in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but all that &apos;s hard at every attempt of a simple translation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a word or expression is enough not to understand why a complete explanation and sometimes something like to understand exactly what is happening with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list .
most of this lists treat Japanese , German , Portuguese , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ certainty &quot; Steven asked to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog , you can see the words of the subject language of Van@@ u@@ atu , as :

Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad had died until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion was removed , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this is a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .

the way of Palestinian scientists Edward S@@ aid was broken in the 1970s , the history behind these images .

this Nar@@ ra@@ onic over@@ sees the reality in the last three decades of nine mus@@ cular women to their countries , while the US is not once again their first female Pre@@ siden@@ cy .
this Nar@@ ra@@ tively failed to realize that if French , mus@@ cular women in turn will be forced to carry out their head towel in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arab , mus@@ cular women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the med@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ ra@@ phi@@ c Muslim women to lead the movements of change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about that the first mus@@ cular bones on the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers were spoken to have been found with sla@@ ven@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this Nar@@ ra@@ phi@@ c has so that our collective approach is so deep and incorrect , that often Si@@ kh men and children are to be used for the purpose of tim@@ el@@ ist attacks and scho@@ oling .
because of these stories we tell , and because of the way we tell , is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , the religion , but it is fear before the other . &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born in Muslim , but a Muslim part was born , when I was four years old , in a provis@@ ional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word but on the spoken word . it is a attempt to obtain the language variety of big cities .
in fact it consists of urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not to be passed on there .
the project is considered :
the mass strike the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that are not forgotten - safe space , in which people do not forget to forget .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand this events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate how to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , history can set their history in their own language and transl@@ ating them to English .
even if the participants are not able to tell a professional history , their dedication and their representation is that you will be able to pass on .

the sy@@ m @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is known for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom and remember that he has done for an open platform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this year &apos;s re : more than the conference on the digital culture , which is held in Berlin , presented a event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Rodri@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a Science Foundation for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Publishing , a Verlag by so @-@ called &apos; Book Collection &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ ers from the book of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Science ( The costs of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that has been published in the last year and is free of charge , contains a number of orders that are free with the free culture in the face of the oppression .
it is a hom@@ age of bass and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge and what the true cost are connected with which this is connected .
activ@@ ates , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , have worked on the movements for free knowledge , have worked on site to look beyond the fog , and to create something sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il to free the beloved and approved Internet volunteer since 15 March 2012 in Syria .
his name was found out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison sentence , in which he was on 3rd October 2015 .
we have since do not have any information on his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory portion of his book with the title collections are his friends and his family , and his family , who want to know his free life and to know it back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el a high price for its participation in a free culture is paid , many of us begin to think about their own business , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today here ?
who did we have decided ?
what do we have done in this process of timeless extreme cases ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activity is since March 2012 in the case of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el made out of the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , an un@@ well @-@ known place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the scri@@ bes and lawyers , N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military Court of its cell in A@@ dra were arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi , she was cont@@ acted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who had received himself as a meeting of Assad government and they were informed of a con@@ scientious obj@@ ection to their husband in knowledge .
his car park and state remain unknown but still unknown .
a pre@@ mise of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , played a decisive role therein to access the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ rew , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently the head of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the bass el founded , writes about 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps there was none of the bas@@ eline of cultural prot@@ esters as the factory , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , the road of numerous civili@@ z@@ ations and the Roman @-@ Roman architecture .
bass could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS worked all that this architecture , which is not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strikes into the digital archae@@ ology and the preservation of the preservation has created a time of time to be the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .

N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband &apos;s knowledge with others , even during his time in the prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made my overall life with freedom , freedom and bass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

from the beginning of the prot@@ esters of 2011 against the regime of B@@ ash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ Rights , according to the European Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) more than 65@@ .000 people disappeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have been arrested or under violence by the regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 according to the international human rights organization , Am@@ ne@@ sty International has died at least at the same time as the international human rights organization .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ id community has been for the release of Bass@@ el .

this is a di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , which was arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other def@@ endants due to contamination from 54 millions of Me@@ tic@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money came from public funds from Mos@@ ambi@@ k with the Council of Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was born in 2016 due to good guidance and urged his re@@ sign@@ ation into the company , which was on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement of the General Assembly of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic , the application had no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a again , since the company is no contro@@ vers@@ y proceedings after his sentence .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the struggle against corruption , and the absence of transparency and is even a return in regard to the efforts of our legal system so that CI@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware that the company is a kind of disciplines against the inci@@ dents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the firm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; floating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not seem to be an appropriate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic of social media , this behaviour is also regarded as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warming &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is a competent type , he would have advis@@ er , after he was sentenced to a arrest sentence , and it has half the half of them .
he could hold the lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could be consulting and his image .
but as he is competent , he has been able to be integrated into the company that he had to add damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a will be paid for his silence .

Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was rewar@@ ded by the state , because he said it , I can &apos;t believe that one might have rewar@@ ded her in such a way that the state has already existed to the state .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is not to return to the state and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of being built itself on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the state , as hand , it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of monetary policy and the state itself .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network , their messages from the network , because it was the word &quot; kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although over the origin of the word , it will usually be used to be used on people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally speaking as Ad@@ jek@@ tiv &quot; Indi@@ ans . &quot;
Facebook inst@@ agram tum@@ blr twitter Search for : search Neu@@ este Beiträge
in recent years , the A@@ scen@@ sion @-@ radic@@ ally @-@ radical movements of the word has an extremely valuable con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word which is often used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ el against Muslims , which is a minority of the population in Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does it mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in reality , the company has a lot of useful content on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be brought in connection with rac@@ ism , but the word of itself is not automatically translated into a Hass@@ an .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have been reported that they have discussed the use of the Word or doubt about his instructions .
there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words of different mean@@ ings that indicate the same letter as &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is also called &apos; kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ster &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Cal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ heres ) , &apos; kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos;@@ kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( Cur@@ el ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ ack A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; :
&quot; &quot; &quot; a post of my friends was deleted , because he was the word kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question password ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ alls is the opinion that she has been radic@@ ally radical nation@@ alists , but also that Facebook may be analy@@ sed before it is trying to spread the rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not manually manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no comment submitted by members ..
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not to understand what you see on the Fac@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do is to analyze the post carefully and check it by using the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar poster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that this dre@@ amy nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ le@@ garde , a fairly good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to uph@@ old their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the promotion is a strong signal to all , the DNA language , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ alth have proved that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of wor@@ ries often often begin to start a new word or alternative Schreib@@ weisen , to press their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at thought , like Facebook , began to delete his posts as he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; from social network is said :
... as I was looking forward to this new gui@@ del@@ ine of Facebook , I made a post to help my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post has been removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook Community &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the post of the author of his opinion , why EU nation@@ alism and religious foundations in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook before the start of the initiative more would have been more likely to ask for example the bur@@ mes@@ an Internet community :
Facebook inst@@ agram tum@@ blr twitter Search for : search Neu@@ este Beiträge
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these words will only bring more hatred within the various communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support , such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; heritage cur@@ ry . &quot;
even as they found out that they did not have error , they tried to change the deleted posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they &apos;re just a bit more respect for the 15 million benefit , which would have a great revenue would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
instead of being serious , users now become aware of Facebook and write the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ an to see if their messages are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ en@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Videos , which were not owned by a Hass@@ an , but still removed from :
the requested URL was not found on this server .
the bur@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and a pe@@ at cur@@ ry and a Indian film .
only to try whether Facebook Follow the Post , which contains the word cal@@ ories . &quot;

in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , the social networks have used to expand their votes and influence their influence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , Hass@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the social sharing of social networks and violence in the churches in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where the war was forced to be forced to escape from thousands of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but instead of simple the word &apos; kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better constant , rather than on code concentrated initiatives and lear@@ nt from them .

on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country is decided that this practice is to offer this practice so that the holy age is now present at 18 lies .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this post was edited by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video , a award winning international community organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content management agreement .
in many parts of India we avoid women with the greatest care to discuss the name of their husband or even of older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a den@@ ial or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ u@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect them because of the social Dru@@ cks to respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ ed out of life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto made out of the Indian state O@@ heim@@ a by a head@@ quar@@ tered and of their family and the village community , after they had a secret relatives with names .
the tradition of their hos@@ tility is not in the name of the name , even among men . however , they have much less access to fear if they should not occur in this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as well as well as well as the house , a unique view of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them that they discuss the enemy of Patri@@ arch@@ al and discuss and discuss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as one of 56 Klu@@ bs , which is in 13 Indian States , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al who is operated by the fel@@ lowship of Patri@@ arch@@ al .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works since seven years with the help of their video camera in addition of practices , such as children &apos;s rat and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these pru@@ dent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she reported a safe place for this women and made them at the same time at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini in their discussion round , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women who call their husband not at the name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has decided for this topic because she wanted to identify the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of their husband is not to discuss the name of their husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t take it , will be considered as final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman without problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tradition is so deep , that we never have never thought up to this discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ mother .
width of raw materials :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother &apos;s mother and my husband said , after the video was at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini took their first task .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor before . some believe that there is a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini has a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video recording , the women , the discussion with an exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked each player to say in the name of her husband with a variety of feelings - happy , sad , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t tell us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husband , but they call us how they want to respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it be equal to be equal ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married , and this was the first day that they took the name of their husband about the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , who would never talk about the name of their husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
width of raw materials :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so scar@@ ed that they can only serve the whole exercise in the whole exercise . another decided to allow the whole an@@ trac@@ ting fru@@ stration against him and his family by taking it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband of a school was less understanding and the situation of violence in violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini reports as women have tried to stop other practices , as for instance , holding the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red points on the foreh@@ ead , the sp@@ est@@ atus is :
why have only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point , if it also work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I heard it , and I heard him to bear him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other women have not heard of it , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose it on some days .
for many women , a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually , we do lunch and water and go out in the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that women could make things &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working for many years to this problem and yet I have more than some things , for example how our identity are taken to our husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it feels great to say certain things to say , quite no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we saw the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have been worn in the group since their marriage .
most of them is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ was cur@@ ta , a wide suit on a pants , wear it .

we have only done little steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women try to say a few times , but then we listened to the name of their husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of me are included , but only if they are alone , and no other family members are .
only one or two had to continue the name of their husband , only one or two women have to wear it on their foreh@@ ead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing to use more freedom of movement or its own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; each of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can also see it .
but this club gives all of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . it will give a chain link if each woman goes home at home and other people that we speak and what we do .

Singapore : city or Land ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear to appear as Singapore on international level as an independent state .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ ova should be considered Singapore as a city .
this note was triggered in the Blog@@ osphere a debate .
during the meeting of a meeting on a meeting of the international branch of the law of New York , the Minister of New York discussed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared to Singapore with other countries .
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has been asked if New York was a democracy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why most people have a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to explain that we are different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the judicial minister to defend his logic to defend the existing authority of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and in@@ op@@ enness , this precious land will tell you that we would not be no country .
it was a vul@@ gar , it had a flight before the responsibilities .
Singapore , when you are not my country , the country is then ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , the cities that are permanently guided by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to beat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is no country but a town is , so the country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if our en@@ roll@@ ment was paid on this point , if it was high paid for the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by An@@ on on the blog , it shows how to read the critic@@ isms of the conference , so that you should start the context of statements from Sh@@ an@@ dic to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ dic , according to where Singapore is a city , and no country .

in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he did not know it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an displays his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ dis , who makes an act of a growing generation to make such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at least , I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the ancient Gar@@ de , what me a@@ waits me - be with them or not , but that is another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ alo@@ on , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure whether it is really believed that he is truly associated with what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek sur@@ passes the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ dic &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Sh@@ an@@ ova am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was a fre@@ ud@@ ding driver ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is no country , we are only seen as an independent and sover@@ eign state ?
when not , in which country go to the sover@@ eign rights of the city towards Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is the country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Government of the Government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ enko is an important significance .
why are the Lon@@ ger of their military service , defend them only their city but not their country ?
who has to pay our Prime Minister to pay ?
what is the value of our rose personnel ?
are we the citizens of a country or the residents of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Singapore is always a town : &quot; &quot; &quot;

no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we were always a town center / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this could be due to one of several reasons :
work with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as a nice , gentle , gentle , but tragic figure N@@ ed flan@@ k from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double bed ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed flan@@ k would be a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can reach .

for about 2,50 Dollars per night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cold , fro@@ sted walls and beds made of metal .
in the pre @-@ room there is a Pap@@ ag@@ eien in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless they are hundreds of African and ha@@ sty migrants .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the Coast begin to call it : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you in Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is more quiet , but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez have been received only 200 guests at the same time .
there is only 24 rooms , some have also s@@ worn out on cardboard .
I would like to reject anyone else .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they do not have any drugs that they do not pay , they don &apos;t pay them with a bal@@ m from the long journey .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asked him if I had an adequate nick@@ name for woman Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family of Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , which has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ ine ) posi@@ tively with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , &quot; reply he with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel really that it fits to her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very nice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the heart of a mother ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will feel very well . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao car@@ es with his sister , hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America .
the family had heard from another way of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the way , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together with the route and that the Afri@@ cans have already wanted to talk to him by Anna Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as many of his way he had lived in Brazil , he had lived in Brazil and has worked as a construction workers in construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
as the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been sold for months at Mama Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to save the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .

&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we can never go back again , &quot; he says . &quot; we will always remain in contact . &quot;
Frau Ram@@ í@@ rez , that their guests are often happy to send text messages when they are ski@@ pped to tell her about the course of their journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it explains that you may be a Christian faith of their work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests were brought to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only way of hope for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter have added Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rants in their small house .
he is poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the bus tickets are sold to many African migrants .
he has begun to help them to get a timely prize , then he has offered them his house for one dollars .
there are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests can do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have cross the border of the wilderness , and we have finished .
there are places where people help and help others . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived three years , he became a Raz@@ er at his work of the United States .
the majority of migrants who come through tap@@ ach@@ ula is coming out of Z@@ ent@@ ral @-@ America , others open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ inda tells me that he wanted to have a plan in Honduras with his wife and his three children before men , they wanted to have a plan without a plan .
in tap@@ ach@@ ula , he has been asked to be asked for a vacation , and an in@@ famous , a single bed , has offered her roof .
some months later , the family are still there , and they try to decide where the next steps shall go .
back in the House of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small bus now arrived and has 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away .

they have done me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t that I didn &apos;t want my lesson . &quot; how the boss of the security staff was form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power over us by giving even the simpl@@ est concepts that we called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; five young people were killed during a peaceful prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ categorized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only my own area is cov@@ eted only my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , for the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city , which is in Ar@@ ter@@ ia with state @-@ organisms and their complications .
in the third night , things had to be cal@@ ming after the power in the quarter was to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
few minutes later , some of my friends wanted enough to find it .
I was not alone .
many friends , true Friends became aware of me : we are taught us to a pra@@ ying picture that my expectations are full and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment , you are aware that you don &apos;t know the Spirit of the lamp , but you don &apos;t have to worry about it in straight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to make the military safety building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned how much Hon@@ ey thou go@@ ose down - nothing can give you the voice from the body until the office of the security service from the body .
I was there there .
the upper Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I can now .
the upper Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; don &apos;t listen to me as you &apos;@@ All@@ ah@@ u Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only true enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t know what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I did , did nothing to do with courage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was before this building .
perhaps it was in my mind , E@@ it@@ el@@ iness ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so confident when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t thought that you have already forgotten my voice for yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe , I never heard you in the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment that could have such bad consequences for me , and yet I have no word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in individual and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ clam@@ ation of this pro@@ clam@@ ation is to me until today in the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Syn@@ drome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a belie@@ ver , who was before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the farm .
in the first office I do everything you want to know with me .
then again by the farm and the second office that leads through a course to the individual cells .
I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Lady@@ boy@@ Nel@@ ly is on @-@ line .

H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his responsibility for those who try to survive with his identity as &quot; Palestinian kill@@ ings of the second generation &quot; - so he called himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think not because of my own life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he went into water from N@@ esc@@ af@@ é in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten up to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ an law is that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with the old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ timent of the Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam against Islam .
basically this is a warm coffee and the man@@ den of the Kent @-@ cigar@@ ette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan as a prison under the sky , especially when one finds a look into the neighbouring countries .
so that prevents it easy to do basic things - like in the public during the Ram@@ adan Water to drink water - to land not to land in the prison .
in other words , the Ministry of Agriculture is a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a , already on the second time .
it is the fact that the Islamic State had to support the Islamic State - the j@@ ord@@ an two g of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual front of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert .

and exactly as they did , until now , thousands of young people have written the letters - love message to former guer@@ ill@@ nesses , in order to welcome them again in the society .

Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience so :
after we left the letters that led me a former fighter by the camp of Guer@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I came into one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , I saw a Guer@@ ill@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer to a letter that I have written for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a lot of fun with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very strong and sat down to the gren@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never thought about life as war . the FAR@@ C was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I would never thought that someone would be given me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society that waits for us with open arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but now where peace , I can learn many things and in dignity . &quot;
new voices in the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and some of the leaders of the FAR@@ C on a discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students were all grown as a war and the FAR@@ C was already in secret .
therefore , the leader of the FAR@@ C is the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave the insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , as the social inj@@ us@@ tice of the state . now , where we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can help to make the society in this country .
for a goal of this size , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people listen to those who had never found their families , and even know that the people who were often seen as monsters , even people with beautiful views , who were fil@@ med by their habit@@ ats and their environment , was very painful for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality of the earth is living in the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it makes me that all people - even those who are killed and so much damage can have something to give us a smile and a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters did not reply to the letters .
Gust@@ avo J@@ á@@ lez , the command of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s not the case .
as long as it is im@@ percep@@ tible , hunger and lack of education , health care and job opportunities , there will always be people that are willing to use weapons and support for their rights .
we will now use the FAR@@ C on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore we call all def@@ enders of peace on - no matter what race , religion or ideology .
we give you our word , make our contribution and make sacrific@@ es , because we know of our experience that nothing is simple . those under us that live life as a basis of existence are many difficulties .
on our way there will be a lot of obstacles but together we will overcome them .

our people know in what hotel you know . you know even your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say , that long as my mother is at life , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we go with camera , I give me the effort to see how the person looks out of their past - so on my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed ?
in the last few weeks , Sab@@ rina : I have last week a report in Washington .
for the needed I needed information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to someone who eat a half month in Ar@@ tur@@ bo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told that during the Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and changed , but that all the end of the Ram@@ adan were hardly able to wait , and he closed a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
thus , I invite them to load the relatives that take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end , a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood gen@@ us .

as far as I know , they will be able to present them later than terr@@ oriz@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are brought up their body in television and say they had attacked any village or military support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people do not simply disappeared , but it is under@@ way to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this now only a comp@@ ass or do you have a source for this information ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have just someone who had a half month in Ar@@ rays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison when her b@@ art was grown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was nothing new from them .
you have simply taken them .
and this so called Lord , this person was himself as these people were taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now they were not known as ban@@ dits , there were no reports that there were no reports that such actions are quite possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why otherwise we could not allow these people to s@@ have themselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
knowing whether these persec@@ utions and performances of people who have been called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past present ?

OC Media : how is this possible under Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were p@@ oured ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , the tubes and the sh@@ ops .
the Security Council of Sch@@ aria has never seen a hair .
in front of the Russian theat@@ res , there were a place where every evening , especially at week@@ ends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several B@@ än@@ ke stood , and all the city knew why men , young people , there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have never heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the ch@@ et@@ ching language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not over the soul of another &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I have discovered these people , when I was walking away .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a vacation ?
let me know that this is al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly the same as Tsch@@ ai@@ des who want to make you with foam before the mouth .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s not pleasant to hear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims who go in the mos@@ que and during the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
knowing how many think they may love the men who love men , and they believe that you change his family to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a Tru@@ g@@ gle .
these are two different things - two different types of the sensitivity to be exactly to be different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not for my body .
not , whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so happy , but my last in@@ time relationship is now longer than one year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sad that I &apos;m so happy - I know that I am myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Do@@ hi@@ mi said that particularly the unemployment benefits has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z new and anti @-@ Arabic percussion and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process :
as functioning and institutions , non @-@ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have access to employers in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national contradictions and force them to make their life expect@@ edly outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their first and desc@@ endants in order to hide their membership to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated to be toler@@ ated because they are speaking of the Arab language or the holy Arab clothing .

when I say that I have no femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ c@@ tional femin@@ ist - with Fr@@ ust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not part of the movement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is even well thought out of scientific and social arguments before me , why I was femin@@ ist , and why we should be all the Fem@@ inist * inside .
this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hyp@@ othe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month . IAB @-@ Discussion Paper 20 / 2015

Hemp exhibition , museum of natural history Fribourg , CH
or that cultural and social standards always ensure that women &apos;s earlier or later in various areas of life on a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination due to the sex@@ es are still moving through the many different countries and other cultures .
all this is aware of me and known .
I am convinced of it and I double and thir@@ sty .
I &apos;m a black woman .
and yet , if I ask for skin color to speak , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q church , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; but if I have chosen this kind of physical , mental and verb@@ al ab@@ uses , many white femin@@ ist@@ ers and white inter@@ c@@ tional femin@@ ist@@ ers .
however , however , however , however , however , however , however , all women have come together to come to &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexual violence , a institutional form of rac@@ ism , who are exposed to black women on two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or beyond that black women and women of other ethnic and adol@@ esc@@ ents , less deser@@ ve than white men and women .
these black girl and girls with a mig@@ rational background of school will be described as white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black co@@ h@@ age and women with mig@@ ration@@ alisation of a higher risk are exposed to domestic violence and violence in partnership with white women .
on the one hand , I will say that all women , all men and ever all men do not have any skin color on the same rights ; but on the other hand , I can not consider me as a black woman , which can take place in their mind , both on the gender and the skin color of one person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhau@@ sted and will not find out more about my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ism @-@ oriented don@@ ors who always have many black women and always again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his speech , 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I desp@@ ise me to maintain a ideology in the black woman in historic ways a des@@ perate and mar@@ gin@@ alized beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe me to join me , which also absor@@ b our customs and customs clearance to drive their eg@@ o@@ bedience program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not try to try white women the importance of the over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue the significance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the inter@@ c@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different Her@@ ism and the white femin@@ ism , always the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been able to lock me fully and completely from femin@@ ism , which has been created for my dark skin and my status as woman &apos;s life , rather than a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so hard to think that Inter@@ se@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it &apos;s important than ever before that we define black women to our own ideas and define ourselves in the sp@@ heres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana , says that we can define ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ cep@@ tible femin@@ ists immediately have been read that they have read these lines , please tell us about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is affected .
in a different environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I am existing .
I will be recognized by my dark skin and due to my existence as part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can be kept in a surroundings where my life is neither over@@ thrown , nor yet shall be rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in this documentation of Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a that explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its church .

scientists from the whole country , that the decades of war , the construction of the war , the construction of storage , the pollution and un@@ controlled development , which will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Wat@@ ers - Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ ers e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protect the rivers , rivers and water paths in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;

the emphasis of her work is on the contrary , a little subtle patterns and is characterized by using the use of syn@@ erg@@ istic techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories on their way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great deal of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the gir@@ der and worked version of the article &quot; The shaft of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ für@@ n . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # so@@ il@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected person .
a Police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship was something time , and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a further woman , Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed more useful information about A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s self @-@ adhesive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some days later , the second wife moved to their ad .
the ad@@ diction of violence against women is difficult .
if women should pay at once again , they get no support from the state .
in many cases the women also depend on men dependent on men who mis@@ ses them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who have to admit the victims of violence , even at the criminal law .

it is difficult to determine how many women really mis@@ ses , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , resear@@ cher for Gen@@ der@@ Model@@ o E@@ studios , a social scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various reasons and reports that show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
at the disposal of the available numbers , however , are alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 we went to the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % of this , it went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adverti@@ sements for domestic violence against peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women .

there is a number of women in Paraguay , which is not responsible for the prosec@@ ution of the law , as many women were murdered every year from their current or former partners .
at least 12 cases of Women &apos;s women in the land .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay is at least 37 cases where women were murdered from their current or former partners .
in Paraguay all ten days a woman in Paraguay all ten days a woman because of violence by men .

today is Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but two years she had brought her psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe result :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never thought that I would have sacrific@@ ed victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have read in earlier , I thought that the only women happens to under@@ go it because they dec@@ eive of violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the formation by Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without name to call her contributions to Facebook , in which they did its rewards and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people answered them to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch , whether he had ever done the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour is also a form of action .

it seemed nearly as far as they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sions are at least a certain thing .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mis@@ erable .
Victoria is a member of the network Com@@ te N@@ te ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that are of women who are in any way victims of Mis@@ sions .
in the group they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .

she led a trial against her former partner , who developed to an un@@ avo@@ idable legal battle between Paraguay and their home country , which was mainly driven by money , power , and the influence of their former partners .

&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not impossible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ak@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN @-@ Organisation for women in Paraguay , is also great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a proposal was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ r@@ llas ( # privil@@ ege ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original design of the law is to explain the significance of the law , which is to explain how it is in the neighbor@@ ing countries to Argentina and Bolivia as it is in neighbor@@ ing countries to Argentina and Bolivia .
* Pinpoint growth sectors and identify factors driving change ; * Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the original law had planned the majority of the ( bureau@@ cra@@ tic and economic ) process to carry out the victims of violence against the victims of violence .
the conclusion that the law does not be effective unless the legisl@@ ator does not require sufficient financial resources to be available :

&quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa : opportunities and abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , set with his in@@ scription
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing range that is one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the requirements of medical research , there are two reasons : a missing in the offer of global healthcare system many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more gra@@ vit@@ ate effects than elsewhere , and missing investments for research of these diseases such as the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secondly , research is carried out by African scientists itself , in the construction of its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be convey@@ ed for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the centr@@ all@@ ab@@ ors at the Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ec@@ tious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially as the AIDS @-@ Epi@@ dem@@ ie first gra@@ vit@@ ation effects on national health .
he departed Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , at first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he asked himself on HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the highest health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier over the future of medical research in Zambia and over abuse of the media about these research .
from the last 30 days from the last 30 days
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research activities ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results in the application of research results .
moreover , I just have a research program for the development of molecular testing testing for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what are your opinion according to the important current science topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they distinguish between those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no fundamental research . we set only solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receiver , rather than ourselves .
the solutions that we get are often used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
GM : where comes the funding and support ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the projects are different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to find people who come back or come here , for the financing and development of development are better than in other countries .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
what obstacles there are in your rout@@ ines research that you do not had previously ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs much money , continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import from other countries .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would propose that thinking and scientific methods should be taught to improve the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : how great is your opinion according to the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should concentrate on and how can we support the development ?

I have seen great students for all age groups .
there are needs to special scientific training , beginning in every age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the pupp@@ trau@@ ma , the healthcare ( not transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicines will be very benefit .
GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do and create access to scientific expertise , which challenges here .
the system that magazines articles are only accessible by payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plant engineering produced worldwide food production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about sol@@ vents for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on was born in the United States since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as the red@@ dish , the first plant which has grown up by NASA @-@ a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space , grown and consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on work has been working only through its own entrance and the question how many sal@@ at@@ oms can get rid of barriers .
but at the beginning of 2000@@ er , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for the bre@@ asts .
the patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to ill@@ nesses , a special rotary or green or green leaves .
in recent years , more such patents have been found in the last few years . due to this trends , plant breeding , environmental protection and expert safety for food security for the future of food production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still has a salad , he needs to go longer because its work is constantly changing due to more restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a river where I have to go on a river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to make this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents are going to go far away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before judgment , nobody can make more a new sal@@ at@@ um , because all characteristics are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes it so good as possible and attempts to make those features that he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is not coinci@@ dental that this name is more so sounds rather than the movement from the IT area , and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Analysis Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software .
it was created in life to ensure that some species of plant species and are not protected as a intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the framework of the initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ss@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; US @-@ breeding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be used to use other seeds of seeds . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dozen bre@@ eders and seed goods have already been connected to the initiative since its start in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;

especially for other plants , there is no need for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by showed that mass production plants like wheat in still larger style are patented as salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are so pleased that they are targeted features - from such that their taste or colour improves their colour as to those in certain environments , such as Sch@@ äd@@ lingen or diseases .
in addition , genetic diversity is no longer needed than ever before the changing conditions caused by the climate change much worse prior to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ alis , that genetic diversity is important and also important for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ ocide and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States used the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant species , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pat@@ ente and the protection of plant species , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plan that can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often help these instructions to come with another method for the same result .
such protection does not prevent innovations , but encour@@ ages them to be provided by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks the different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , but surely no innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are waiting for a long time to wait for plants that are adapted to the change of environmental conditions , it would have lost the struggle already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main source for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have been a general public , and still remains : &quot; independent plant waste , neither the money nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ key incen@@ tives are not attractive for us .
farmers want to make money their work easier .
that is what we are ant@@ agon@@ istic and it will not be impossible if we can continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on is to pat@@ rol on the concept to pat@@ rol , &quot; we create the features not really even .
the plants form themselves from and as a bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants do the plants .
a mystery of nature .
Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member , there is still a further important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who have a variety of kinds of plant extracts also in them .
but who does not believe in industrial agriculture with big ben@@ ches and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , which are needed for the cultivation of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is accurate . &quot;
during some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are interested in international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are the most smaller seeds , but small as such as Mon@@ san@@ to are to survive even without patents - either sit down or keep it for expensive and therefore not worth knowing or both is the case .

this time we met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a Kolum@@ ba .
on the weekend to re@@ vise the Egyptian government the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which is documented in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
published on Facebook , published on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities have been critic@@ ised for this stage and said , the work and effort for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information - despite this attack and the constitution by the authorities , which had to defend themselves in this part of the world and had to defend themselves in this part of the world to overcome these goals and victims in the Arab world , it was still not so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities should be expected to overcome these goals .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered as the first of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities against more than two months of 21 websites , like b@@ sp@@ her , the independent post of M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s network by Al Jaz@@ e@@ era .

&quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , 12 June , we thought as the sper@@ m &apos;s website began to offer the V@@ PN@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filters to block the Egyptian users .
the situation is in addition to that the z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ning decisions are taken behind the doors , making the Egyptian population is no legal basis that they can go against these actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question : how far the Egyptian government is willing to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will serve it as next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controlled areas outside the Damascus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Damascus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which led to local residents , or by tunnel and control points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the years long block@@ ade are traditional food products such as meat can become un@@ related for large parts of the population .
as a counter sign a group of Syrian armed Hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics , the inhabitants of the East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can have their own mushrooms as a vital food source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ lo@@ da and lead the project together with the help of Al Ad@@ ala . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mushrooms does not belong to the conventional , in Syria destro@@ ys diet and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen .
the side of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French intelligence agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate the cultivation of fung@@ us because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can find it in homes and wa@@ ist plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers of the organizers of the Global Vo@@ ices , that the project was known for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the initiative is based on gener@@ ators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity in 80 % .
the fuel oil will be used locally in plastic , to supply the gener@@ ators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they are given their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we went to a small mush@@ room in a pan . when this was , used with a larger cal@@ ender . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teaching farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months they have been distributed everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which is composed of six@@ ty EU members , lies currently in accordance with important financial and the Constitu@@ ent Committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it was the first time that he had been arrested at the Court of Justice .
in recent years , its verdi@@ ct was moved on the 20th of May , because the prison strike according to the human rights group had failed to bring the accused of prison in the court hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death penalty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a number of human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
