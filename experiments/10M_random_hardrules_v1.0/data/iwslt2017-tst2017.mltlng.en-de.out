it is another chapter which should leave a remaining impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence agencies in which the CIA signed Iran will be able to strike a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but don &apos;t know what the chapter is not pleased ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for almost 10 years , the government are determined against cra@@ cks and to name him to name his alleged sources .
in this morning he became the symbol of the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ook and journalists to lead to journalists and journalists .
according to the First Senate , the media have the right to publish a secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right to apply if media does not receive such information and if they cannot protect them .
so as the government of Ris@@ en ank@@ ed , he did something that many of the repor@@ ters already knew before him , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , ris@@ post@@ a with the risk to go into prison .
but then , only days before the trial , pas@@ siv@@ ating something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although it would have been for years , it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were left to cra@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters can always hide the repor@@ ters and sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of fail and cra@@ cks to the statements , they could take his digital foot@@ steps for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in the midst of this information there were evidence which they used to explain Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ells and cra@@ dle of the source source to condem@@ n .
unfortunately , this only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Obama said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can imagine how it can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as a living stage .
since the 11th of September it was almost every article about national security , the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ st was given to a journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore rely on the press of the game that is protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ments , because the government has always been more possibilities to carry out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;

instead of e @-@ mail , go to a news website so as the Washington Post .
you can upload documents or information in any ordinary contact form .
this will then be encryp@@ ted and stored on a server , just the respective news agency .
so , the government has no more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information that would request it would be not available .

it seems to be removed from you , ordinary people .
why should we go to what ?
but the truth is : if the Rei@@ chen and mighty in the situation is to hide their fortune in control phases and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these disclosure is phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world , the media and leading politicians , like secret tax ev@@ ils of some few , you will be able to hide and wear them -- something that we have for ten years and un@@ cover them .
I think many people use this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how these tax cuts work .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
one has a company in another company , in another company , which was almost impossible to understand , who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult to understand the legal and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society as well as for journalists or civil society .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , because there was no prominent German Americans that came in these disclosure , that sc@@ andal came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but through the principle , according to these control phases , Mos@@ que Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers .
if we had a data l@@ eck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would also see much more cases and examples which have the connections in the USA .
in fact , it is so that there is less information required to get a company to get a company to get a firm passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of in@@ transparent colour@@ ing in the USA has allowed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school children &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a lawyer who would like to submit to a lawyer about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a lawyer about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how he could transfer money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one of these lawyers took us as a cli@@ ent@@ ele , and of course there was no money for us . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer that has spread our hidden proposals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going to be a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system work , through the corruption , tax , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to meet this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to create this kind of behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States have pl@@ um@@ ed the USA .
the two parties have brought a draft proposal in both parties , but this does not mean the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama ju@@ ices , that huge insight into the world of control phases are used as a means to ensure that in the US and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ quar@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t make it clear that this kind of tax cuts , corruption and money can finally end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

one type in the red coat was standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city , and made a road@@ trip through all the land . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid to the bill , I made mistakes to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where , you say this night ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

do I have to offer a sleeping space ?

apart from happiness and timing we thought that you can find the correct design of confidence that you can find the correct design .
design can help to overcome deep @-@ threatening prejudi@@ ces .
I think that &apos;s what you think

we know that design does not solve any problem .
but if we could help this great influence , I ask myself that we can use our design .
thank you so much .
what do you think if you see me ?
how much does it mean ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain tum@@ ult , a terrorist writer ?
or simply a delay on the safety flag at the airport .
this is true .
I do not give you the gu@@ ilt for your negative impressions .

studies show that the Americans didn &apos;t know what would have to know .
probably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber .
for all those who have never met a Muslim world : it is great to know what you know .
I say to you , who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream .

I &apos;m so happy with it .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ pled me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslims min . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you think you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ tige was a time for me , but for me a femin@@ ist dictatorship , and in the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty ideal for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not only pas@@ sively the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been using the correlation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw him , thought in question , des@@ perate and believed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship to God was not love at the first glance .
it was confidence and slow dedication that will destroy themselves with each reading of the Cor@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am aware of myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever find the feeling that someone help you destroy it , but somehow it loves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , I married and started , as all the good Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this terrible morning in September 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , I had the opportunity to see the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft fle@@ ets in building , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings .
what was that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; an accident ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why should we do so much ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country , but in the n@@ u related me the works of other by one &apos;s citizens .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West to take into a new city and start with the assembly of the assembly .
I remember how I went to -- as we went out -- so deep it went into my sitting area , and I realised that the first time was known as Muslims min .
we departed in this night in our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it was the day of that day -- the day to gather together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not at this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw the extensive coverage of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country , our country were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to explain to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .

today we can hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we start it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want Muslims do Muslims ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the US .
there is only the question : are we b@@ iting or better ?
you know : a mal@@ icious tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our is only under observation .
the alternatives are useful because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ ors in the body of the US , but a vital organ .

Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , invent@@ ors and Olymp@@ ion@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will perhaps be a few parking place , but not the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people to toler@@ ate people from other faith .
and as a director of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently told us : people are actually radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
the Radi@@ c@@ ality process has found that he begins with the person of their church , even by their family , that the person believes the true Muslims , and anyone who believed their behavior and its ideology and its ideology .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must keep the people to go to mos@@ que .
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
in the case of a group like the IS @-@ IS their gross @-@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as the Muslim people , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add them into their imagination , when they det@@ ained them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one sees a look at them , they do not know what they were in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their gross value to read these things into the scrip@@ ture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I told me a amazing story : &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl came to him because she would have happened to close to the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone was talking to silence , and said her anger , her sense for the inj@@ us@@ tice in the world , they only bring to difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing is inspired and something that has been given to its anger it was a main objective for the instrumental analysis by extreme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extreme &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of her anger , he showed her construc@@ tive ways to a real change in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what they learned in the mos@@ que , they brought them before the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an introduction to Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and my family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does it work on normal Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work on any other ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the 24 hours consumption of fear every day on our democracy out of our thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- &apos; if we fear us , pass at least three things .
we accept a authorized government , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you have been comm@@ enting messages when they have been reported , they are rather affected by military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a language problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims go on top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this three times , but never in connection with the terrorist attacks .
it happened at the beginning of the Ira@@ k@@ war , and during the two electoral periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to make the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens .
on the contrary , it is possible to return to the Muslim Br@@ otherhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear of fear us all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collective action is not only to explain themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife in Yus@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chap@@ el Hill , North Carolina , where both to school .
De@@ ah was a sport .
he was at the dental Faculty , tal@@ kers , lots of attrac@@ ting ...
his sister would say that he was the southern , generous person who knew them .
she visited him there and he showed his CV . she was paid and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is made out of my bre@@ asts , such a multip@@ licity of young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , she was murdered , as the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an who was murdered at the afternoon .
he had eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ sm can not only be un@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we go to mos@@ que or we stayed safely at home ?
we felt it and for us it was no easy decision , because of America we want to leave our children : one that would be able to control us by fear , or one that we can be free to exercise our religion .
we decided to tell the mos@@ que .
with our son in the kinder@@ garten , we went to the mos@@ que , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went forth my shoes , went into the prayers of prayer , and what I saw .

if you look at the Muslims in the world , and I did this with the largest ever seen study on the world , people want to live normal things .

today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the borders of the se@@ wage at the autonomous flight .
so that a system aut@@ on@@ om is working , it must be collective to know where in space there are the mobile objects .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to focus objects . that enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a deadline of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board , which should do the machine .
External commands are available to the highest levels , e.g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flight device &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is trying to beat two feet with a cl@@ amping board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like other Star@@ r@@ ater , it is efficient as much more efficient than helic@@ op@@ ters in all of their variations .
unlike most lim@@ estone , it can be sw@@ ung , and has a large benefits at startup and landing , it is very versatile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is always a cat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a limitation of rear axle is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ations like wind conditions .
we develop new control and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ line is no longer able to increase the optimum position and improves performance through wheels .

during our research we are often fundamental abstract questions about the core of the matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one such question would be for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such question .
helic@@ op@@ ters are known around the machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts that leads to viol@@ ate you .
in front of decades ago , highly @-@ controlled air @-@ controlled flight equipment , which had only two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a rear wheel .

this is the mon@@ osp@@ els , the mechan@@ ically controlled planes . it was a short time ago .
it has only a moving part , a propeller ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; no means of arms , hin@@ ge and cross country , no further actu@@ ators or controls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a propeller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although it is mechan@@ ically , it happens in the interior , so that it can be stable and can move around in space .
yet it &apos;s not about the elegant way of the rear side of the rear . to bring it to the window , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood that it was exactly right , if I look at all , it is low , therefore I show you a video that was in the evening .

however , something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is out of electronics , electronics or battery -- the machine can continue to fly .
we will now demonstrate that we are able to demonstrate a half of flight .

the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can do not have any simple images of objects in the universe .
but by using changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies in the listening area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to convert wave patterns in Sch@@ all , we can listen to the All book@@ shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gra@@ vit@@ ation of the Gra@@ vit@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be betra@@ yed us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , so that my colon@@ ies have been very long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
SH : two black , not rot@@ ated holes , just just : w@@ up@@ p !
the two body was very fast , the two bodies are very fast , listen to the same cartridge with an additional sound change . that &apos;s so on : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement which is pre@@ destined to the wav@@ el@@ ength .
AA : on 14 September 2015 , a date , which at least I have never forgotten -- it can be heard from the sound of the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold paras@@ ite , which is just as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .

two black holes , the body &apos;s body in the All , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 Sonata , just a hundred times per second , before they col@@ ur@@ sed .

on this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in the All we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically everything .
a super nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ ded .
they are very useful . of them we have learned much about the All .
the exciting physical processes , however , in the core , which lies behind a thous@@ and@@ th of iron , carbon and silicon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never go down there as these op@@ ak are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it as the jud@@ ging by his own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible until the start to the start .
and probably most important : I am optim@@ istic that in the All matters we have never seen that we have never seen , and we don &apos;t have to have seen . things that we can only discover by doing so .
in fact , Lig@@ o is equal in the first stop of things that we didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am looking forward to seeing a lot of stars on the map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are enormous , the old body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to make a totally different view angle on the events in All the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : it is now possible to be as possible as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to deal with great det@@ ectors and the noise of the cos@@ mos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new ob@@ servers -- a very new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ ations on Earth and in the All . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , that I brought me to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fear@@ ed my fear .

the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain amount of yes that I changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ ant item , it began with a question of my small .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the small , is called for un@@ declared reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

that Yes , the beginning was the beginning
a new life of life in my family . from there , I will be able to play with them as soon as you go to them . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say to Yes -- every single times .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , to my family , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a subtle side effect : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , I understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say to you , that all of you who do so hard work , a country or a class room , a business or a household , that you may understand that I am not only on the computer around the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ es , and it is true if I say , I understand that there is a dream of dreams .
it is all a job , all , everything reality , everything blood , all of sweat . no tears .
I have been working much , tough and I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot; &quot; &quot;
my work began to be a country out of nowhere .
it is , when I was on a screen , I was on a screen .
as a result , one sees a high sound , which is a mar@@ vell@@ ous .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and rob@@ ber@@ y , funny and irrit@@ ating , fri@@ ght@@ ful and dist@@ orted , cru@@ el and reasonable , and the best of it is the Sum@@ men .
there is so a change in me when the job is good .
a sum@@ mer@@ time begins in my head , and grows and grows and grows , and the Sum@@ men will listen as a bel@@ lish way , I could always drive for you .
many people take over if I know the Sum@@ men , that I know that writing was a pleasure for writing .
understand me , do not understand it .
but the Sum@@ men -- as I started working with the TV production , I started to work and work together , and I discovered this matter to create this energy . Sum@@ men !
the sum@@ mers are more than writing .
the sum@@ mers are action and activity . Sum@@ men is a drug .
the Sum@@ men &apos;s music . Sum@@ men is light and air .
the Sum@@ men &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t look differently than size .
the feeling , not differently to seek , regardless of size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ men .

maybe it is the genius of genius .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vampire Diaries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; castet Leslie @-@ Anne Huff für S7 &quot;
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know that I am not for a failure , and I know that I love the Sum@@ men .
I will tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I will not want it to question .
at the same time , the more , more , more than ever , more epis@@ odes , the more work , the more work , the more work , the more you see , the more I will see history , more and more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what I said about work ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love work , not true ?
the land which I create , the mar@@ vell@@ ous , the army , the army , the high sound , the Sum@@ men , the Sum@@ men .
I like this Sum@@ men . I love the Sum@@ men .
I need the Sum@@ men . I am the Sum@@ men .
am I only that sum@@ mer@@ time ?
and then the Sum@@ men .

there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .

I loved my work . I loved my work .
the Sum@@ men came not back .
my sum@@ mer@@ time was kap@@ utt .
I made the same things such as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , no regret , no regret , a titanium ra@@ ft , not on , with all your heart , clear sight , what is always .
but there was no rain .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to be aware of myself two things : &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , I have to say yes to say , and secondly , she called me not &quot; sh@@ aking . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happens ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know when I am and my sum@@ mers , and now they change anything before my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , I will play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters to play it much and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness , and in the absence of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything .

the sum@@ mers come up slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly visible , but it is there .
not the Sum@@ men , but a Sum@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I feel like a magical mystery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . that is everything .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ mers , the work@@ sum@@ s , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you , who you are , if I have to tell you , if I want to con@@ quer me with the ship@@ ments and TV hours and how to the my brain , I have forgotten what the real Sum@@ men .
the sum@@ mers are not a power and it is not unemployed .
it &apos;s depends on pleasure .
the real sum@@ mers are dependent on love .
the sum@@ mers are the current , which comes from the life of life .
the real eye is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ mits to the pressure of history , the expect@@ ation and the pressure .
the real eye is simple and original .
the real eye is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he pra@@ ying me to God the false words , for which God said unto me that I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child has been playing with me I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so happy that I will free myself as a workout of any gu@@ ilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the Sum@@ men .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not well in the games , I like it .

as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedy .
I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a heavy impact , or after an auto@@ graph .
it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , a very low ability to mount the body .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a consistent , severe dis@@ ability .
this is probably the reason why I am functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ inflammation ?
a doctor who attempts to improve the nerve functions through different surgical interventions .
one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ mol@@ n@@ esia , &quot; im@@ plant@@ ation one electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the switching of the ne@@ ural function as well as the neuro@@ logical function .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease which improves the organic herbs and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the Bible functional Neuro@@ inflammation is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach to this dream .
I would like to show you very close .
with something help , the brain can help itself .
the history began on 15 years ago .
at the time I was instruc@@ ted Ober@@ trau@@ tin and worked on the day and night in the emergency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often the patients with cran@@ ial @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n gra@@ mat@@ a the brain tissue and the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , it must decrease the damage pressure .
for this reason , you need to remove a part in the brain tissue .
with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I said ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to grow cells from this fabric .
this is not easy task .
cells from a tissue to grow , is comparable to quite small children who will be taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments , to let it thri@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to do with these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was for us a great surprise .
why ? why ?
it saw exactly as a master cell culture . with great green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you can turn away from the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ lessons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small N@@ ative of the brain .
it &apos;s surprising that this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the operation .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal master cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they die , they are ignor@@ ant .
but this cells are different differently .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
we saw a new , rare cell therapy that looked like stem cells .
we needed for long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
this blue and red cells tight Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you can make 4 % of our large living cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the brain , they ensure the circuit of the brain .
why do they stay with us ?
we do not know .
we believe that they are in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concent@@ rations close to brain damage .
but that &apos;s not so safe .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand before a potential cell source , the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to prove it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain tissue from the non @-@ linguistic section and then the cells precisely as well as the Jean @-@ François did
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are colored , in order to watch them in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final step we finished them at the disposal of the same individuals .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we happen this cells in normal brain tissue rei@@ m@@ ete ? and what will happen when we pass the same cells in cryst@@ all@@ ine brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with mon@@ keys .
in the first scenario we met the cells in a healthy brain , and we said that they have been completely removed in some weeks as they would come back home . the room is already engaged , they will not disappear from home .
in the second scenario , we have a violation of the same cells and the cells in the cells .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ ete .
the proof that they show , are these small points . these are the cells we are in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop it .
help this cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so , we met mon@@ keys with a manual intervention task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
as they reached a stable history level , we have reached the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex in the mot@@ ic Cort@@ ex field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once Upon a Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sc@@ ru@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ Revival bei Net@@ fli@@ x in Arbeit &quot; &quot; &quot;

patients are treated and then try to recover the plastic bra@@ ins mechanisms . you pick up to a certain degree , as well as the mon@@ keys .
as we were sure that the A@@ ffe had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , im@@ plant@@ ed we its own cells .
on the left side they see the mon@@ keys that spont@@ ane@@ ously had spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can be about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
see now , as we see the cells of the cells : the same A@@ ffe , two months after the trav@@ eller .
I can tell you that we were very exciting results .
since this time we have found very much more about this cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can co@@ operate them and later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still going to im@@ plant@@ ing them at the im@@ plant@@ ation .

of course , the question which are the greatest obstacles before you can begin clinical studies on people .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities .
BG : it is understand@@ able that the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look forward to the future -- you have completed the research and tried the permission to start the clinical studies as many years it takes until someone can come into the hospital and this therapy is available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to start it soon ?
this paper investigates the impact of non @-@ take @-@ up for two hyp@@ othe@@ tical scenarios , namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by € 100 per month .
it needs a long time to choose the patients to carry out treatments and rate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
one must have to point out that it is useful when one can offer this treatment .

democracy in democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we see the democracy not as the broken plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to consider it as un@@ changing ge@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its great demand in Beijing have shown that it is quite clear that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth during the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the democracy in us in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I came to Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- elected me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- the elections that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not the austerity programs that have been realised in Greece .
in that moment I thought it would have been no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Commun@@ ist party of China , or some of my own friends asked me that democracy would be changed if they would change anything .
I would like to give you an economic model for a genuine democracy .
I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mission , we could save ourselves the democracy but that we could have a true and true democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are mixed , our future dark and our great , new technologies .
on the subject of any application , I would like to ask you to an interesting contradiction , which is part of our host .

in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar invested in all the prosperity produced goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , roads , track , equipment , equipment and so on .
3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollar sounds like a lot of money , until you have the same time in the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else , except the flan@@ ges and the real estate prices .
- What is the market potential compared to other countries ? among the key reasons to purchase include the following :
the result is st@@ agn@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 weeks in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and therefore a low total economic demand that might not invest in an end . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who would kill him to kill him when he will grow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a good thing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is my hair with the capitalism -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue , we understand what we understand under democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ otel@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form , which control the poor and the poor as the majority of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ le@@ tic democracy of course came to many from -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a mistake by the ath@@ le@@ tic democracy because of this failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy and is that they were not only the right to free expression , but more important and decisive is that they are entitled to the right to political parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not been maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a candle , the very bright lights , it is also burned quickly .
but today , our present @-@ liberal democra@@ cies were not in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 1688 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy can be concentrated on the free citizens of concentrated and the working poor , it is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a that ultimately had a constitution for ruling .
for the liberal democracy came only on , as a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of the policy pursu@@ ed , while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- a democratic @-@ zone zone .
in our present democra@@ cies since the time when this separation of politics and economy began to under@@ go a vast struggle between the two instead by the economy gradually gradually acceler@@ ates the policy .
send me why the politicians do not have more than previously ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is in fact that it can be in the government , and still not at power because the power of the policy in the economy is used and the areas are separated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mentioned my hair with the capitalism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you think about it , it is like a herd of smo@@ kers who are so long lasting the animals that they have nour@@ ished and dec@@ im@@ ated it at the end .
it is similar to the economy as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as the economic crisis is growing . the power of the fleet is growing , the im@@ itation of the economic demand and the managing director of the concert are to be afraid to invest in the business of their businesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of democracy are distri@@ butes , the higher will the twin members of human labour power and the welfare of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , it is obvious that we need the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control reserves the control so as in ancient Athens , apart from the number of slaves , women and foreigners .
that is not a new idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist revolution had this idea for 100 years and it went not a well known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the employees are only re@@ strained by a miracle as in ancient Athens without new types of bro@@ ality and re@@ use .
but there is a solution : the employees !
&quot; &quot; &quot; capitalism does it to be replaced by the low @-@ value wage @-@ wage @-@ wage @-@ wage @-@ wage through automation and robot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that long @-@ term economic and politics are separated , the automation will be higher in countries such as it is very soon as I think -- in countries such as China will come in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to design the economy and the fields of economy and politics , and to make sure that we are re@@ united in democratic , otherwise we are able to appear in a disease &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is not that capitalism has brought the technical awak@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interesting question is that capitalism is solved by a D@@ yst@@ eine , similar in the &quot; matrix &quot; , in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ os &quot; Ag@@ ora &quot; in long discussions .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what makes it look like , how could it look like this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the practical implementation , I would like to call you a few examples .
in the field of companies : make a capital market in which you deser@@ ves money , while you work and in which your capital is working in you from a working position to the next , and the company -- no matter what you just works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and out of rede@@ em and the concept of wage labour is completely covered .
no means more between those who belong to companies which are not working in working , and employees who do not belong to those who do not belong to those who do not belong to the company but no big gaps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately don &apos;t have a big tw@@ ins .

imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; Green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are homogen@@ ized .
this is not a new idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the reason why John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es in the Bre@@ t@@ ton in the Conference of 1944 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was that we had not implement the technical resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , we have seen them , especially before the background of a recur@@ rent economic policy and economy .
the world that I advoc@@ ated to you , is at the same time the liber@@ alisation of the history , and Marxist , because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the field of the history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ an@@ ical , global ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ an@@ ical .
but above all others , there is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we go into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar m@@ yst@@ op@@ ause ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer depends on how we decide to work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is in our hands and we do it better understand .
thank you so much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
in your biography himself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how to play Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I said earlier , it is Marx .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... T@@ un we do not , the technological development will generate a so massive decline of the overall economic demand , which was called on Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
due to the transfer of this crisis by one part of the Earth to the next , it will not only experience our democratic democracy but also the countries , whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if these analysis is justified , Marx is definitely relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and how Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are also well .
Y@@ V : if you do not have anything , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was all that he said . BG : in your talk , you have Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner , you have very clear what you have seen from the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have witn@@ essed a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on the policy , while the area where is the most difficult , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I must say the so prov@@ oked China today , today the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to connect the liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically .
Liber@@ alism , liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?
what to be seen in China is very much the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , what the West in the 19th century itself has done to do the West in the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers were curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I know that it comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you see six months later on the first half of ? ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new top ,
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a great deal of self @-@ confidence in the Eurozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek ancest@@ or -- the way , the first proposal was , who was the first proposal .
unfortunately , the powers of the euro@@ zone remains in the Eurozone , within the Euro Group , the laying is chosen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but you know what comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get a economic system , which is not capable of being able to get rid of political will and part of the life , it will perhaps be a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
Moodle : BG @-@ bab : calendar : day view :
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change their assembly .
BG : did you have any errors in your time as financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who look back ... seriously ...
if it is a financial minister , or any minister , who is in the office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he didn &apos;t have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
Dezember 2011 November 2011
the biggest problem was to sign the application for the renewal of the debt program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an ambitious interest in the money to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that wasn &apos;t it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to make our government only because they wanted to go with the employment of the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t have to admit that she had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece since 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the Tro@@ ika of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies , who stood on this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of convers@@ ations , don &apos;t seem to be right pro @-@ Federalist .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone has come from someone who lives and loves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not living . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for when they are not covered , the fre@@ ew@@ ed forces are destroying forces , and the European Union destroy .
this is not alone for European cat@@ astrop@@ hic circumstances , but for the whole world economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are probably the biggest economy of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , when we set ourselves in the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be re@@ lie@@ ve for the future of the Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you start the show , when you start breaks , which parts you get back to again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them to produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would make a Sit@@ com to four Republi@@ can US Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House &quot; but it seems that not many of these show cannot remember because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this Kur@@ ve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House at 7,5 -- so something about the average , but not that the Roy and his team was worked .
at the same time at another company , another manager has been a top @-@ show by data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always looking for the search to find this a super show and he uses the data for this , but it makes it a little different .
instead of a competition , he has seen the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews that give them the shows , which shows them , etc .
then they use these data to find out this small details about the viewers : what shows them , what producers who actors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Marcia Cross in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quantico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Spoiler ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
don &apos;t know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;

they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic fails to work that it should work .
if you want to show millions of data , for a decision that you should meet , then you should make a good decision .
data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ?

if data analysis does not work , then this is something to live because we live in a time when we live in a time when we meet serious decisions , far beyond the television .

no . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that none in this room is ever seen in touch with this software . come in touch with this software you are in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone asks you in the US in prison , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ appointment or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , if a show is good or bad , if a person is good or bad .
central TV , 22 minutes , that can be quite bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
* Understand the competitive environment , the market &apos;s major players and leading brands ; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
not always the best results . this is not that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .

it was wonderful and was a great post @-@ compensation . the success of success in an publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it was perfectly suited to the year by year , until it suddenly no more functional ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was easy to use , this was once again a sensation , including the item of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in spite of all this errors , data can be found in decisions of life a -- on the workplace , during the legal proceedings , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I know many difficulties with data . I have been working in the computer @-@ based Gene@@ tics -- a field where some very wise man un@@ ordered many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years I have known some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and non @-@ successful decisions .
do you need to solve a complex problem , you are mainly two things :
as fulfil@@ ment of this problem in its details , so that you can analyze the details as a second place you will find the details together in order to gain a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and Data Analysis , no matter how ma@@ stered , can only help solve a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assem@@ ble the parts again and then come to a discharge .
for this there is another tool and we possess it all : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , it is especially difficult when it is the brain of a experts .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and mind where they belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better . but the decision how to take all these parts , and a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what it meant that they went a great personal risk with this decision .
Originaltitel : CSI : crime Scene Investig@@ ation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I believe that things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how fast they are , data is only a tool , and to forget that it is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before the data , this is the device for decisions .
many know it .
the Magic 8 Ball is called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ ws or no problem , you only need to shake the ball to get a answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have met some decisions in my life , where I have had heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through a lot of much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic design .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s possible to make decisions that we want to make decisions , when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I find this as a very encour@@ agement message that it is still worth@@ while to meet decisions , an expert in which what you do , and risks .
because at the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you can at the right end of the curve .
