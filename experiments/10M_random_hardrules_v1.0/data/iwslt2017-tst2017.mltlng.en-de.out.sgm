<seg id="1106">In spite of all this errors, data can be found in decisions of life a -- on the workplace, during the legal proceedings, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I know many difficulties with data. I have been working in the computer-based Genetics -- a field where some very wise man unordered many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have known some patterns regarding the difference between successful decisions based on data and non-successful decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem, you are mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As fulfilment of this problem in its details, so that you can analyze the details as a second place you will find the details together in order to gain a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and Data Analysis, no matter how mastered, can only help solve a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a discharge.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, it is especially difficult when it is the brain of a experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have data and mind where they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better. but the decision how to take all these parts, and a show as "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what it meant that they went a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>

<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could say," "" "tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It was not the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I believe that things are wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how fast they are, data is only a tool, and to forget that it is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>

<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>

<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life, where I have had heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through a lot of much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic design.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "it's possible to make decisions that we want to make decisions, when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I find this as a very encouragement message that it is still worthwhile to meet decisions, an expert in which what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you can at the right end of the curve.</seg>
