<seg id="2581">But a new study is the opposite: a diet, which is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory disorders.</seg>

<seg id="2584">The researcher researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to make sure that harmful microphones which hide themselves in the food, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells which are immune to inflammation, are controlled by cells to protect the tolerance and protect the body without irritating tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If balance is in the direction of inflammation, it can result an anti-inflammatory reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments in experiments were found that a kind of tolerance and tolerance immune cells at mice, which has a certain bacterium in their inhalation.</seg>
<seg id="2588">The bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the design of proteins in the cells of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterium - Lactobacillus, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerance of tolerance.</seg>
