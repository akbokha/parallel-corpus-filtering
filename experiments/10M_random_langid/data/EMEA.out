&quot; in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the melting tab@@ let@@ ts in patients , where the gor@@ ges of tablets were prepared for patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who take other medicines to be dis@@ continued , the dosage of abili@@ s should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this is the signal transfer between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which allow the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably known as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and D@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter is used to activate the rec@@ ept@@ ors . &quot;

the effectiveness of abili@@ s to prevent the recovery of the symptoms was examined in three studies on a year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ect@@ sl@@ s was compared to two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases associated with a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a further study , abili@@ zing over twelve weeks in 279 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ tis , in a different study the effectiveness of abili@@ zing and plac@@ ebo which have already stabili@@ zed to 160 patients who were already stabili@@ zed with abili@@ zing symptoms already . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of abili@@ zing inj@@ ect@@ sl@@ ing solution has been observed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which was compared by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ologist ) and Plac@@ ebo via a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change of symptoms of the patients may be based on a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients treated on treatment . &quot;
the company led also studies to investigate how the body regul@@ ates the melting tab@@ let@@ ts and the solution to take the solution .
&quot; in the two studies , patients showed a significant increase in cans of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction of symptoms associated with the patient that received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study on the 460 women with met@@ ast@@ atic breast cancer .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in case of some gift or mon@@ oun@@ ces ) was compared with conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; overall in the study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
only the patients who have been treated with met@@ ast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with regard to the conditions of the disease and survival are no difference between the medicines .
&quot; on the other hand , patients showed the other treatments for their met@@ ast@@ atic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane is more than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it must also be applied to patients who have the medicine or before the start of the treatment in the blood .
&quot; the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ina ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients , for which the first treatment does not have more pro@@ poses , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el must not be given to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;

&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ al or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ese or ins@@ ulin may be kept at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ lical ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin better can be better , and the blood glucose level is reduced , thereby reducing the type 2 diabetes slow@@ ing better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ Therapy , patients received a combination of Met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ al , in addition they received a combination of Met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ al , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ ous hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c advertising , which allows the blood glucose values in the dosing of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study showed the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ine in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values to 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional offering of plac@@ ebo to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 289 patients showed a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % , compared to 0.@@ 14 % , compared to 0.0@@ 14 % . &quot;
&quot; most common side effects in connection with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper breathing ( cold position ) , weight reduction and hy@@ po@@ cer@@ al ( reduced sensitivity compared to friction ) . &quot;

&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar with ins@@ ulin ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
patients who are endanger@@ ed by the presence of a risk factor ( e.g. se@@ duc@@ er heart inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom cor@@ on@@ are heart disease ) should increase the doctor &apos;s treatment with the lowest available dose and dosage .

&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a flock , weight reduction and oil , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in combination with ins@@ ulin is applied . &quot;
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ arian Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and the existing advanced gen@@ ital disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of her@@ ding effect , however , however , is not an increase of mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
patients ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors up to 3 @-@ in the upper limit of the standard range , the liver is increased as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient does not develop an hep@@ atic Dy@@ s@@ function , such as imp@@ ec@@ tious nau@@ sea , fatigue , appeti@@ te , ti@@ red@@ ness , and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver problems . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , should be led to the decision of the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight reduction can be combined with fat deposits , and in some cases with liquid det@@ ectors . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a stimul@@ ator , under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a slight reduction of the medium density values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ mat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction in 4.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; similar changes have been observed in the comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in order ( relative reduction of the heads of 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower amount of patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ al and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ mo@@ sis in order to 1 @-@ 2 % and of hem@@ mat@@ oc@@ r@@ its at 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in the framework of a clinical study with multiple control , in the Des@@ kt@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily to 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ologic effect was described . &quot;

&quot; the safety of Des@@ kt@@ at@@ adi@@ n is identical with children between 2 and 11 years , which is identical with the children , the normal metaboli@@ c . &quot;

the total of the side effects of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years old was similar to the plac@@ ebo @-@ group .
&quot; for inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects were reported on the common side effects of plac@@ ebo , Di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and stroke ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;

&quot; when the recommended cans were the plasma preparation of Des@@ kt@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see under section 5.2 ) , for children and ad@@ ulthood . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and young children no longer increased the frequency of bat compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ tains , the allergi@@ i@@ tis can also be allergi@@ c in dependence on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; according to the overall version of the question@@ n@@ aire for life with Rhin@@ o @-@ ar@@ tivi@@ tis , reduced A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the risk of seasonal allergi@@ c reactions . &quot;
&quot; the spread of these limited metaboli@@ c phenomena was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution is necessary to take the same concentration of Des@@ kt@@ at@@ adi@@ n , there was no bio@@ degra@@ dation study , and it is expected that it corresponds to the Sir@@ up and the tablets . &quot;

&quot; according to appointments of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system reduces the immune system in the vacc@@ ine as a &quot; physical activity &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies . &quot;
this reduces the immune system later in the position to form a flu virus .
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ ce of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins at the membran@@ es surface , the human body as a physical organism ) are separated , cleaned and used as a part of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;

19 Ba@@ ing on these data should be considered during the treatment optimization with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ dead &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
the average duration is the medium duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ alia avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases for C@@ max . 30 % reduced when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ bre avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ alia avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the au@@ c but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ alia avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; hence the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) of the nutritional consumption , although the simultaneous food consumption is influenced by the amount and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent rate volume amounts to about 430 l ( 6 l / kg during a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be set to a large survey volume as well as a hin@@ dered Pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ and@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .

the safety and effectiveness of al@@ monds have not been used for adults over 65 years and for these patients can be recommended no Do@@ ck@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ thir@@ ties for patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ tation was not recommended , and for these patients may not be recommended . &quot;
&quot; with algae @-@ treated patients , in@@ fu@@ sion@@ ing reactions may develop in@@ fu@@ sive reactions that are defined as any in relation to the in@@ fusion or to the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this reason , especially these patients should also be monitored , and the in@@ fusion of algae should be monitored within a reasonable clinical environment . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study it is expected that nearly all patients were Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies against the lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months . &quot;
patients who develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of in@@ fu@@ sion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with care of algae ( see Fig@@ ure@@ 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as little experience concerning the recovery of treatment after a longer period of inter@@ ruption , it must be checked due to the theore@@ tic risk of an over@@ dose response after a inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minim@@ ise the potential impact of hazardous reactions .

the safety and effectiveness of al@@ thir@@ ties have been examined in a random@@ ized , double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ arding controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients in the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients for the study were identified , the majority of patients from central phen@@ otype and only a patient proved the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were rec@@ tified if they had been exp@@ elled against the expected value volume ( FE@@ V ) by less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to go up to 6 minutes . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the limits of the limits of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute path of the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ oc@@ las@@ hing test .
all patients were subsequently used for a Open @-@ label extension study where they received more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ ms .

&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous path@@ ology , the clin@@ ically significant changes can be taken into consideration , the clin@@ ically significant changes in five patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted an annual open @-@ 2 study , mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ology of Al@@ f@@ az@@ d in 20 patients ( 16 patients with the heavy loaded form and 4 with the central locking form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased by increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is not applied to human pregnancy , thus Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used as necessary , it is necessary to be considered by the treatment doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were most common in clinical trials ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least perhaps using Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of survival and reactions at the administration of the administration ( burning , dis@@ infection , dis@@ infection and pain ) were included in post @-@ marketing activities . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar occur@@ ences of un@@ desirable events like in the other Do@@ ck@@ groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relations . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large @-@ market volume , a Di@@ aly@@ se is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ ety . &quot;

Res@@ or@@ ption after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows a spec@@ ulative decrease in the body with average termin@@ ology of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - IBM ) are generally in general throughout the whole D@@ os@@ is@@ ium area of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ - kg for patients and cancer patients .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg each second day for a total of 3 cans , the middle ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from phar@@ ro@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that the number of 0.@@ 75 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is comparable to the following days of the total of 0.@@ 75 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . however , the C@@ max was higher than the amount of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .

&quot; after a long absence of intra@@ ven@@ ous ra@@ inf@@ ect@@ tion , the overall physical body 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe intra@@ ocular diseases the termin@@ ology of the termin@@ ology and the average systematic ex@@ position with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified . &quot;
&quot; in the clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are observed as sufficient above the maximum of human therapeutic ex@@ positions , which suggests a small amount of relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From the clinical trials , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is involved in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ os@@ cope , which are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ous de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation are involved in the action of action . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Intervention ( CH@@ MP ) is a negative statement in which the approval of hep@@ atitis C provides a negative statement to the treatment of hep@@ atitis 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections to the treatment of hep@@ atitis C . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alph@@ eon has a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which should be described in the EU . &quot;
Alph@@ abet should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( one by a virus infection of liver disease ) .
liver tissue samples are also increased by liver damage to the liver tissue ( AL@@ T ) in the blood of the blood .
it is produced by a yeast which was produced by a gene ( DNA ) which was brought to education of the active agent .
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ abe@@ tical data before , the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A - ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug by means of active safety , safety and effectiveness of hep@@ atitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon has been compared to the effectiveness of the reference points by 820 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the treatment was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns concerns that the data for stability of the active agent and the reduction of the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with Hepatitis C , which is similar to treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting of treatment with Alph@@ eon flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients , also Alph@@ eon more side effects . &quot;
&quot; aside from the study of the study , how far the medicine is a immun@@ ity ( i.e. the body forms the anti@@ body - special proteins against the medicine ) , not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cruci@@ fix@@ ion ) , and small in@@ equ@@ ations ( Ris@@ es or cutting ) , de@@ fer@@ ing and gen@@ dered wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go shall not be used to treat infections , which are confirmed or presum@@ ably by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ sis ( MR@@ SA ) caused because alarm go against these kinds of infections may not acts against this kind of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but with patients under 18 years of age may not be treated as 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient doesn &apos;t work after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the doctor to investigate the patient to investigate the patient &apos;s patients and alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by block@@ ade of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle and proteins in which proteins are produced ) and the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ ces of effectiveness was in all five trials of patients whose infection after the treatment was deduc@@ ted .
119 ( 8@@ 5.8 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to the treatment of infected skin , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ Judy in other response : if the results of both studies have been taken , they said about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go has been confirmed that Al@@ tar@@ go in the treatment of drainage ( ei@@ vable @-@ filled surfaces ) or of infections , the present or presum@@ ed by MR@@ SA cannot be effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a friction coefficient .
&quot; when it &apos;s too late , when it &apos;s too late , the results of Al@@ tar@@ go to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go to the risks associated with Al@@ tar@@ go to the risks associated with the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • Anti @-@ Laz@@ er@@ ations , dis@@ crete or gen@@ dered wounds . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , Ambi@@ rix will be used for protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) at the age between one and 15 years , which are still not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is applied in the frame of two cans with existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be achieved after visiting the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used when the immun@@ isation are only used when the immune system consists of hep@@ atitis B infection and ensure that the existing vacc@@ ine can be led to the end of the vacc@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if a patient over@@ dose is given against hep@@ atitis A or B &apos;s , you can be used with Ambi@@ rix or other hep@@ atitis G or B @-@ vacc@@ ine . &quot;
vacc@@ ines may affect the immune system ( the natural movement of the body ) .
&quot; after a child of vacc@@ ine , the immune system is the immune system of viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; stranger &quot; and produces anti@@ bodies . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as since 1996 , vacc@@ ine vacc@@ ine adults and since 1997 registered vacc@@ ine children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children in the framework of an existing vacc@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients , some of the data that uses Twin@@ rix adults , also used as cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of the spiritual children who had a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of vacc@@ ine is compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;

the additional study showed that the degree of protection consists of Ambi@@ rix at a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are head@@ lines , appeti@@ zing , pain at injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ ures ( fatigue ) as well as friction . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may respond to patients , which may be over@@ flowing ( allergi@@ c ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;

&quot; the standardis@@ ed plan for Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ine , whereby the first dose is determined by six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; when a patient care is used for hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B , it can be used with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al vacc@@ ines or with a combination of a combination . &quot;

&quot; it is still not completely secure , whether immun@@ o@@ eing people who need to have a hep@@ atitis G vacc@@ ination , because they are protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As in all injection methods , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ al@@ ese reaction to the gift of the vacc@@ ine corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision can be immediately available . &quot;
&quot; if a faster protection against hep@@ atitis B is recommended , the Standardi@@ z@@ pf@@ sch@@ ema is recommended , the 360 EL@@ ISA @-@ units formed hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies are achieved in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines can be necessary .

&quot; the hep@@ atitis A virus is normally transmitted through the vir@@ ul@@ cer food and beverage , but can also be transferred through other paths such as by Baden in through Ab@@ w@@ waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blad@@ der , yellow skin and / or eyes ( joints ) and other symptoms that may cause a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; like all vacc@@ ines may not be complete before a infection with hep@@ atitis G or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ine series is finished with 2 cans . &quot;
&quot; if you know / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines are already infected with hep@@ atitis G or hep@@ atitis B virus infected ( although you can &apos;t feel your child to the vacc@@ ine point , or feel ) can &apos;t prevent a vacc@@ ination of the disease may not prevent damage . &quot;
&quot; a protection against other infections , which may cause liver or symptoms that are similar to a Hepatitis B or hep@@ atitis B infection , cannot be considered . &quot;
&quot; • If you already have an allergi@@ c reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vacc@@ ine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ biotic ) . &quot;

&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B , i.e. within 6 months and before the first vacc@@ ination of the second vacc@@ ine ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will assist you in your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will advise you with your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis C / Hepatitis B vacc@@ ine ( 360 EL@@ ISA ) units of a form@@ alin@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface area ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with reduced rate levels , usually a month after the first dose , and is likely to give you to your child a vacc@@ ine before the vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it will suffer from Ambi@@ rix at people who suffer from heavy blood diseases , under the skin and not in muscle in your body , or if you want to take your child in your body &apos;s body , or if you want to dis@@ solve your child in your body &apos;s body , or if you want to dis@@ solve your child in your body &apos;s body . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune system can &apos;t be sufficient to see such a blood test may be necessary to see how much the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is necessary . &quot;
21 . do your doctor if you take your child in any medic@@ ations ( including those who have been able to get involved in any case ) or if you are interested in the future .
&quot; it may be , however , that in that case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient , and the person cannot be protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vacc@@ ine is given at the same time with Ambi@@ ms , should be given to separate places and as possible as different limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix at the same time or just before or after a injection of immigrants , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is urg@@ ently needed for hep@@ atitis B or for hep@@ atitis B as well as hep@@ atitis B as well as hep@@ atitis B . &quot;

&quot; the Committee for Human@@ izing Cream ( CH@@ MP ) , to the conclusion that am@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ia results are effective . &quot;
the Ammon@@ ites was admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances as due to the sel@@ ective disorder of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzymes have already been manifest@@ ed in the New Testament ( within the first 28 Leb@@ anese age ) .
&quot; in patients with a delayed form ( in@@ complete enzymes , which is formed after the first lifestyle ) , there is a indication for the use when used in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese En@@ doc@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to take tablets or for patients with gor@@ ges , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be found in gran@@ at@@ form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose will be adjusted individually under consideration of the protein toler@@ ance and the development of the development and development of the day &apos;s daily life . &quot;

the importance of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indication ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a propag@@ ation of neur@@ ons and to a stolen loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed friction of zer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ sen and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a dis@@ ability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be found if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the breast milk is removed , and from this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the feeding time is contra@@ indication ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , at 56 % of the patients at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) , and at 78 % of these un@@ desired events , it was not that they were not with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( .pdf 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;

&quot; if there is a PCI is done , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after PCI can be added after surgery with the reduced in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .

the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a common intra@@ ven@@ ous bolt is removed from 0.0@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a weight of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of an all@@ ergy of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended if a short PCI is planned .

&quot; in order to reduce the accuracy of the lower account , the re@@ trac@@ ted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals before the application carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ do@@ sis can be used in intra@@ ven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required to set up the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; in patients with medium @-@ difficult kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be used to be treated against AC@@ S , should be treated to a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults aged adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the upper arm or the upper arm or as a permanent in@@ fusion of ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease that is not sufficient ins@@ ulin in the control of glucose metabolism or ins@@ ulin in the blood .
ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ tis distingu@@ ishes itself from a little bit of human@@ ins@@ ulin and the change means that it has faster and has a shorter active experience as a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the change of the concentration of substance gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ ary hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
adults with type 2 diabetes was the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0.0@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human@@ eness .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be over@@ flowing ( allergi@@ c ) against ins@@ ing@@ lu@@ li@@ um or one of the other components that are already affected by hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if there is a number of other medicines that can lead to the blood glucose levels .
September 2004 : the European Commission on the Company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH is a approval for the integration of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , in the field of abdom@@ inal or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion of the abdom@@ inal cord . &quot;
&quot; due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced ins@@ ulin capacity , the ins@@ ulin requirement can be detected in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; every change of the substance , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , the ins@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ inc@@ ense , etc ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method , a change of ins@@ ulin resistance can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ adequate dose or absence of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ in@@ ant diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gl@@ yc@@ lical and diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy . &quot;
the transition of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin in another manufacturer should be done under str@@ ingent regulatory supervision .
&quot; at the time of the re@@ forming of a Hy@@ po@@ ker@@ ato@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore change the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as . &quot;

&quot; after a glucose tolerance , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ anium for heavy Hy@@ po@@ gl@@ yc@@ lical and similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lowers blood glucose levels through the stimulation of the peripheral glucose ( especially due to Sk@@ el@@ ett@@ muscles and fat ) and through the inhibit@@ ing of glucose metabolism in the liver .
