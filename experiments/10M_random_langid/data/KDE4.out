met@@ adata are defined as data . met@@ adata can be handled according to your definition information that will be handled by any application or documentation of other information provided by a application or environment .
&quot; I wish to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not know how many photos you have to have a specific photo . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know , before you &apos;re doing something in your system in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be organized on your computer , if you want to save yourself on a reserved drive , or on a network run , etc . &quot;
&quot; you will be happy with this structure . the other photos will be found in one year several times at the same place . if you are enough photos , you &apos;ll be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . use a folder for images you print or on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements as e.g. ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different subjects and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % working files , you will not want to organize your structure for these content . &quot;
what types of files are stored together ? the separation of data types makes stap@@ le processing easier . separate new from old files .
&quot; the separation of original and working files will simpli@@ fy a backup strategy and migration . they will always know if you are looking for a original or earlier image . &quot;
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata to store the Met@@ adata from the Met@@ adata to enable them to activate the Met@@ adata from the database to select the Met@@ adata from the database to select the Met@@ adata from the database . if you are using the Met@@ adata from the database , select the Met@@ adata from the database to select the Met@@ adata from the database . &quot;
now you have a lot of information in your database but what happens when you want to change ?
&quot; now you can start the real work , as you should choose any photo albums , circum@@ ference and a rating . you can start the best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let us now with key@@ boards , keys , such as you are often hot or other programs often hot , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to build a picture gallery from another source with embedded key@@ boards , then it will be able to build the tree for you to build the right place . the pictures of the Hier@@ archy within the construction site is no problem and can be easily done by using a sub@@ structure . &quot;
the graphics shows how different met@@ adata can cut into truth . this is a very coarse representation of met@@ adata in truth out of many sections . filename and calendar data can be shown in all pictures .
&quot; enough of the key words - the next section refers to fittings , or comments on the third key tool to convert your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to send your photos to your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panoramic view . it &apos;s not even a nice beach . if you look closer to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha can be present in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y the 60 years . &quot;
&quot; for other users , the title may possibly be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you want to tell you a story . remember , the key is it the meaning to the viewer , to help you to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s not perfect , if it &apos;s not perfect , it &apos;s only with a circum@@ ference for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; you can export your images in the web @-@ galleries ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , when your images are ex@@ ported to your wishes , then you can export it to a selection of images at the same time . &quot;

&quot; in order to fight the problem at CDs / DVDs , you must be more difficult to get more difficult and more expensive than a few years . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in the good disper@@ sion and good recording equipment . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors . 75 % of the data are only effective , the rest we need for form@@ atting and the check@@ sum@@ ms . despite this massive protective mechanism they are needed to protect the formul@@ as , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust and etc . &quot;

&quot; Google presents a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk@@ s : disk analysis of hard disk@@ s . &quot;
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error rate of 35 ° C to 45 ° C .
&quot; this is a complete loss of over@@ voltage due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a current if you can use the files , but these losses are normally stored without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric appliances are not so successful , the damage to computer chips and high speed processes can be different . &quot;
the most widespread protection against electricity is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is a part of the energy @-@ dri@@ lls and the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug bar .
&quot; if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should be sure that it offers the UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a specific minimum protection . you should also be sure that it offers protection against flash cards and thus protects the correctly connected devices . &quot;
this applies also for telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms . this applies also for telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms . this applies also for telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms .
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will have a portable over@@ voltage protection . a multitude of these devices are specially designed for emergency braking and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; during a over@@ voltage protection system before smaller quantities in the power lines , it will not help you to invest in a complete failure . even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of unwanted data . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can also be used to save the power supply when a power failure . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and the system . if you have a UPS , you should be sure that they will get the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of battery and the use of software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be exposed to your computer with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 costs , a 500@@ W UPS . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Services - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store these as a backup target for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are in comparison to the hard disk@@ s , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; Ds , 75 per year and 400 GB . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore not only a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com &quot;
&quot; in view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically assured by the TCP protocol and with the big companies . &quot;
&quot; the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all documents are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk . &quot;
&quot; the worst of it is that no one says when a transfer error occurred , not when this happens in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ aware that there should be no protection of your computer . no one seems to be no protection to you . no one seems to be no protection in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable net items are another source of line @-@ up , because they generate inter@@ changeable inside the data streams . &quot;
&quot; even if you do not have any particular problems , you should look at the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ system seems to be one of two candidates to be able to be able to be able to be able to be lower , and highly scalable license for Solaris and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle offers an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ump file system . this is still the same protection mechanisms of Z@@ FS , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the core . &quot;
it is not necessary ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebooks and 46 % at the workplace .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most masters . it leads to a lower damage , as a theft or new install@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as Pro@@ pri@@ et@@ aires systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is a better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to be a very good English product . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a file is transferred to corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process in a sudden break during a operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if , a file doesn &apos;t have been completely stored before the problem is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main subject for data loss . &quot;
&quot; sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical borders . this is that the technology developed further , it is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and bin@@ ocular surface for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit . &quot;
&quot; for higher resolution cameras , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; and make sure your data is frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you have any risk like the new installation of your operating system , replacement of sheets or the size of hard disk@@ s . &quot;
&quot; make sure your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes it if the drive is not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; you are usually a whole room or a complete house . you can normally use a whole room or a complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vation is always not local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs up to the adjacent house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above is already a more common reason for a data loss , despite logging the Pan@@ ic . if you have a backup not immediately , then you can save the day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files may be saved . it is a snapshot of all files without history and is a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup file that has been changed since the last complete control points . creates a complete snapshot of the complete fe@@ eder and the last differential inputs .
&quot; returns the original status when the last backup have been modified . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup does not prevent such backup system at the next with the exception , it is only ab@@ sent and not continuously . &quot;
&quot; r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that allows you to set easily on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP details or other types of file transfer , copied to the difference of files that are really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
&quot; this approach allows you to discover an entire daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot of each month . &quot;

this tool is five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve the picture in most cases .
the functions can be used to make automatic correction and contrast from the menu of cor@@ ner@@ ing and contrast from your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects . you will have to experiment with these effects . you will need to look at the best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the leu@@ st@@ air values over the entire picture that the dark point black and the light point is as light as possible without its colour sh@@ red@@ ness .
&quot; this method is adjusted to the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the intensity is as flat as much as possible . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ ize the colour range in red , green and blue sk@@ ies . the dark and bright border tones and adjustment of the red , green and blue channels on the entire hist@@ ogra@@ m area . &quot;
&quot; contrast , this method increases the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the lowest possible values and the highest values for the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b@@ ing of all values between between . this is visible when balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the white scratch coat of &amp; digi@@ came ; it is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white button .
&quot; if you are not able to perform a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour , you can be able to perform from the original image , which can be used in the 16 @-@ bit mode . if you are able to perform the white @-@ bit mode in the 16 @-@ bit mode , you will get your possibilities for correction . &quot;
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the jQuery Slider.com credit line as well as the window to the window .
the window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side are the original image as well as the preview of the destination . the preview will be adapted to the settings of the work@@ station .
the preview of the destination photos has a red Mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els are indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
&quot; a hist@@ ogra@@ m is indicated , once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful as soon as you can choose a parameters . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful as you can choose whether one of the three colours or your amount will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
the contrast of your result depends on the shadow of satur@@ ation and g@@ amma .
&quot; using the above @-@ controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on these buttons and then somewhere on the image quality , the temperature and green values automatically be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can choose the white cardboard box with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the heat ex@@ changer increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the Pix@@ els , this will be shown in the preview as pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image . &quot;
&quot; each adjustment of the white cardboard box , you can store it in a text file and then download again . &quot;
&quot; default settings , all filters are returned to their default values and the related lines . note that the default settings will be changed as your original . if you store this store , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; for troubleshooting , feature requests and general help contact Customer Support at . make sure to include details on your browser , operating system , jQuery Slider version and a link ( or relevant code ) . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw image . it uses the change and condition of colour profiles .
this tool is helpful if your camera or your scanner can be used at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always be used for several photos .
a very powerful way of exercise is the tool for the gra@@ dation that you can find under colours Gra@@ vity in the menu .
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar radiation , also sab@@ ot@@ age , one effect of the image has a part of a short flash light and then the development of the image rot@@ ated by the additional light . this also had the effect that the bright areas of the picture . this tool was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool allows you to handle this interesting effect . &quot;
the intensity is controlled by solar cell . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image that chem@@ ically produced is possible .
&quot; this is an example of solar solar efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the installation ( 2 ) , which is the same ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ dia filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot , effect . it distingu@@ ishes itself from one of satur@@ ation that it makes a more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors of thin and we@@ aker . try it simply to be sure many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light to the contrast edges . the parameter level control the brightness of the result and the slide show the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ ly@@ ts .
digital cameras have often problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to change your photos with the tools in the menu under colours .
if you do a photo at the bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : an important choice for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation .
between the complex tools Gra@@ ve and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ field / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool box correction for improving the exposure of the slide .
&quot; the window contains a gra@@ phs of intensity values , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , the active edge or the selected item . under the gra@@ phs of the image , the dark and the right side is the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn to learn it is the controller to move the controller as well as the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic using the settings of the picture , updated on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set to be set if the hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single column . &quot;
&quot; three control : the top of the dark sounds , the medium for the bright colours and the lower frequencies are often mentioned . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the original colour p@@ all@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the shell values of the shade , medium and bright colours . furthermore , there is a button for an automatic cooling . &quot;
&quot; output values can be used for the output values for each area . there are two control elements can be used to create the output values , e.g. for example , the compression of output values can be used as background during the for@@ eg@@ round . the compression of output values can be used as background during the for@@ eg@@ round . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically adjusted automatically based on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
store and store : with these buttons can be saved in the file system and later be loaded again .
&quot; if you want to use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the inputs is automatically re@@ achable for all shade , medium and solar lighting . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to set the original image of the hist@@ ogra@@ m for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ o channels . &quot;
&quot; the option provides all color channels to find and provide the combined results of all channels . in order to see an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect in the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the inputs , red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left @-@ hand side , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be updated dynamic in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
Modification : this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this cage , two symbols are recorded between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ ic view . &quot;
&quot; when you move a cur@@ b to the right , e.g. the bright colours , then you can see that the bright colours are dark colours with dark output intensity and the related image manipulation is dark . &quot;
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it up to your taste .
store and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve is stored in the file system and later be loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p spa format .
&quot; if you want to use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes and buttons allow the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; if in more than a channel , the option will be shown in order to see the combined result . if in more than a channel over@@ sized pixel , you will get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect during the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can view a black @-@ white image , which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channel . shadow and solar panels was applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ came ; it is a tool to improve the color channels or the colour sc@@ ars of the pictures .
the channel mixer is a further high @-@ developed tool to mix the colour tones of pictures . you can edit it from the menu channel audio mixer .
with the channel selection box you can choose the colour for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and re@@ trac@@ ing . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison .
the preview of the destination has a red Mark@@ er . if you move this in the picture form a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : controller for red , green , and construction allow you to add the corresponding brightness components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ re , the reduction of an color to an invisible speaker that comes from the colour of the colour , which is not in the same place in the color of the colour . if this is the case , you can reduce your Mon@@ och@@ et conversion . &quot;
&quot; in order to save as and loading buttons are used for this purposes , any any mixer type can be used for later and then download . the use of the file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ unit format . &quot;
&quot; the option provides all color channels to find and provide the combined results of all channels . in order to see an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect in the final result . &quot;
below you can watch a photo on the blue channel .
&quot; black / White @-@ Photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of the digital photography , black / White is a work step , as colour images can be easily adjusted to the computer . &quot;

shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for car@@ ving . it is very fast and easy to creates especially in dark areas .
&quot; Un@@ ite mask works on the contrast of the edges around a picture . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather simple Job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; refra@@ c@@ tive is perhaps the best of the three , as it really gets the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; this is because the Digit@@ alization process comes with only minimal differences to a colour point . this is that the same phenomenon can be printed with only minimal differences to a colour point . this in turn means that sharp edges can be printed on paper , so that the same phenomenon can be printed on paper as normal cameras for private users . &quot;

&quot; if you want to disable it , you can get the control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can obtain the results by using a photo with the archi@@ val work@@ station .
&quot; in general , it is highly recommended that the results does not work very naturally : the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also the smoking . in general , the change of the image is increased . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too hard . the solution to record a little smooth , is much easier than it . use the tool on the right side of the dialog box and experiment with the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing is a very good tool to remove mu@@ er from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview will help the image to edit the image . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters that produce radi@@ us and the amount . the default values are often good results , and should first affect the effect . &quot;
&quot; the radi@@ us represents a lot of pixels on each side of a edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ os . you should therefore be able to see pictures by best in their final resolution . &quot;
the amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the wi@@ pe image one of the original is added . this is the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
&quot; the sw@@ ell@@ value is a split out of the maximum RGB value and to use the difference input . one can define areas with a soft change of the filter . thus , the areas are avoided with a soft change between the pot@@ able and therefore beauty errors in Ges@@ ing , heaven and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ate was used with radi@@ us = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ ell@@ value = 0.0 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Bauer AG &amp; Co . kg has been used as a tool with improvement of the shar@@ eholder . it uses the protected protected protected emp@@ tying filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe . &quot;
this tool is trying to get a picture to see the picture . this is a better approach than just to try the photo . this is a better approach than just to try the photo .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding mechanism is much better than the pal@@ let &apos;s fo@@ aming . the pal@@ let &apos;s fo@@ aming has a very long tail , which performs the mathematical result from the source library , which is widely distributed by the source library . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the pal@@ ate is influenced in most cases . the causes of unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value of this module should be very un@@ sharp when your image is very un@@ sharp , but then on Hei@@ ligen@@ lexikon . &quot;
correlation : an increase of correlation can help art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be used by 0 @-@ 1 .
the filters can help you to reduce the filters of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values can be higher than 0.1 . however , values can be higher than 0.1 . if the equivalent filter is low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality is very badly . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch . this is most often used by a previously re@@ shar@@ able filter . if you use a value of the array , you must also increase the correlation and / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or / or /
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size . an increase of mat@@ ri@@ ces can create good results , especially if you choose a large values for the circular penet@@ rating or the pal@@ let &apos;s skin . however , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the storage as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . each other refra@@ c@@ ading parameter is set to be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try all the cutting , color and intensity usage on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; if you use the module , before you change the module before you change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations will not be visible immediately , but later un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should read the module on the un@@ compressed image . &quot;

download the buttons to save as and loading exactly this . each adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later .
&quot; it is compar@@ atively fast at work . it can take it very fast at work . it can be very long , and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore get the calculation at any time with the mouse button . &quot;
below you can see the picture shows with small art@@ ef@@ acts . this module is made available on a photo that has caused a black art@@ ef@@ act in the for@@ eg@@ round that caused a bad movie during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) .
&quot; for this purpose , it is the most powerful tool to reduce image output . it is used as a protected system protected by Peter rear . &quot;
&quot; this tool gives sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens ; it can also be used to remove the sensor from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ ins ; it can be removed from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor &apos;s digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen photo shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity .
&quot; in the following cases you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ windows details and the advanced settings can remain at the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radi@@ us control the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter by the image and the color in it will cast the image and the colour into it . &quot;
&quot; this value sets the pixel size of the filter to determine the filter by the filter . if it is increased , it can change the edges when you change this setting . &quot;
edges : control the edge accuracy for the edge .
fluor@@ escent : controlled the lumin@@ aire of the picture . we recommend you to improve colour or light density to improve a picture . these settings are not controlled by the details provided by the details .
color : the colour toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you to improve colour or light density to improve a picture . these settings are not controlled by the details provided by the details .
g@@ amma : control the Gam@@ mat@@ urg@@ ently of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas which are typically re @-@ toler@@ ated .
absorption : controlled the alignment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ ns . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius . when it is increased to appear on the edges of the illumination . when it is increased , the edges of the edges shall be removed and is the recommended method . &quot;
store and store : these buttons are used for use . all parameters to be saved on the file system can be saved in the file system and later .
this is an example of how to change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes it is sometimes a picture for your purpose . the solution to record a little soft for your purpose .
&quot; at the same time , photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; this filter to the Restau@@ ration gives you the possibility of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to Gau@@ lle , scrat@@ ching , scrat@@ ching , scrat@@ ches , compression effects and local bugs that makes it possible to remove the image con@@ tours and makes the content as it is also the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture is used with another tool that was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of GRE@@ SS CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ con@@ ia and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .

photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively fast at work . it can take a very long time and a high CPU burden .
below you can see how a photo with par@@ odon@@ to@@ es will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that can be seen on a black and white photo that can be viewed with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( tm ) HP @-@ 5 film with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO .
below you can see a further example of the photo restoration .

&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are especially in high @-@ quality food mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ up suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove the &amp; quot ; hot pixels , and &quot; &quot; bright pixel &quot; &quot; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ strate method . there are currently no manual approach to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file in the assistant with the Dark picture . the tool is highlighted by automatic the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the image .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel . &quot;
&quot; first , as in previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the corrected picture . an automatic processing of the dark pixel is to be found . please note that the final result is the last dark picture and this automatically stops the next session . &quot;
the image settings and the preview will help you within the picture the result . the input window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select one area around the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ fere this pixel blocks .
Dur@@ ation : it is a average of the neighbor@@ ing pixels . the resulting color will be assigned to all faul@@ ty inter@@ pol@@ ation in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation is separately available for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 of pixel block are used to calculate the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
square : this is the standard filtered method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are used to calculate an bi @-@ cubic surface ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ di@@ m ) .
below you can see the hot@@ test correction on a color photo from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been added to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; in this way , it is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ ant , i.e. under@@ lined corners , a picture to correct . &quot;
&quot; in the middle and large photo format , they can also reduce the corners and edges of the picture by taking the light into the sensor . &quot;
&quot; it has also dis@@ advantages . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 when aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be the camera with the hand . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtration and color change , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter transformation in a raw image to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter transformation . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the V@@ ign@@ iter @-@ correction filter and with three further the exposure of the destination . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter determines the degree of light sensitivity at the point of the biggest density . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma -@@ settings : the editing of a picture with the V@@ ign@@ et@@ ching correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixel . you must change the exposure of the target with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine new adjustment of the target of the destination , you can drag the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / G@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ bs from the menu . &quot;
this is an example of the V@@ ign@@ et@@ om@@ ination correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected picture . a lamp is performed in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
this tool works with geomet@@ ric pattern . colour chart can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ coefficient of the second gra@@ dient is treated by the general geomet@@ rical pattern of Lin@@ se and can correct the conc@@ ave form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ effici@@ ents of the third gra@@ der has a similar round effect , flat but on the edges . these correc@@ tions are not applied in the mold . &quot;
the co@@ effici@@ ents of the gra@@ dient gra@@ bbed the distant corners of the second gra@@ des . if you can combine these two geomet@@ ric lo@@ ung@@ es virtually unchanged .
&quot; generally : this value is controlled the strength of the second gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and positive values , and positive values kis@@ ses . &quot;
corner : this value is controlled the strength of the ext@@ inc@@ tion . this value is stronger than in the middle of the image .
Zoom : this value is scalable up the image size and leads a correction of the first gra@@ ding through the negative values during the positive image .
&quot; bright : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values them increase . &quot;
to help you find the best filter settings to find the best filter settings . the values you use for your image will be saved and the next start as standard values .
the ton@@ - or cushion correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . if you are not able to cut these correction than all the first by . if you want to cut out this correction than all the first .
&quot; to help you to help the best correction you can find this tool , as e.g. the sea edge or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
if you have a cushion cover the resulting picture of black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in menu transform@@ ations from the window or above the zoom control of this dialog .
&quot; the next logical step for some pictures , like pictures from front , frame and painting it is the perspective that all the angle in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with the hand , you will always have a slight change of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ hole correction on a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org website . the filter re@@ produced the well known il@@ ford ( tm ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can choose the range for the preview . if you want to choose the red rect@@ angle using the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can simul@@ ate two parameters of the film gra@@ bs and the domin@@ ance of a high @-@ sensitive movie . the ISO controller change the quantity of film gra@@ bs and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter cartridges are required to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on Black / White photos because the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infrared fil@@ esystem is applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the defined picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie was set up to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of A@@ ura into the Spitz@@ es .
&quot; this is a simple , easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to improve your pictures . this is by classic High @-@ speed filters such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of films to improve the manufacturer of great silver @-@ gra@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood , or seems to be back into the past . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , image photographic , gra@@ ffiti photo , especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be adjusted to control of intensity and gran@@ ularity of grain grain . the standard value is , although often higher values can be needed to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grain , you can use the filters several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) .

&quot; as a result , your digital images have a nice look like an oil soap . natural pictures and style life are well suited for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two controls in order to influence these effects . the upper ends the brush size between one and five of the thick@@ ening brush is better for large pictures . &quot;
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the Mach@@ ete is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixels is 1 and smoothing .
&quot; the engine was used to define color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon k@@ iz@@ ze . the lines , which are used in drawing , are not ideal for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two controller with a value of 1 to 100 , in order to control this effect . the upper control sets the pin size of and the lower the contrast ( smoothing ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adaptation of intensity value .
&quot; in this way , the engraving has been used for the digi@@ ti@@ zed by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the filter uses a quick tool to turn your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with a simple structure that is not the most important on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity in order to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ a landscape . &quot;
the depth allows the contrast of the filter capacity . a value of 30 is equivalent to 10 % is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and built @-@ in image ( 2 ) . the use of depth is 10 % .
&quot; using this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a lens using vertical effect trans@@ formers . it is used as used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;

&quot; the size and density of drops are not automatically adjust@@ s the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the selection tool to keep the range free of shelves . use the selection tool to choose the range , e.g. a face , which will remain free of rain . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the reg@@ ression model . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the defined picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can view it through Spi@@ cker or turning into the right orientation . the tools can find you in the menu transform@@ ations and transform@@ ations . &quot;
photo shooting is definitely one of the most important tools to enlarge a photo to enlarge a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; the most important question is , how can you find a picture on how you can get a picture ? how can you find a picture ? how can you find out how the limits of the resolution ? how can you find the missing information or err@@ as ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here ? how can you find the missing information about it and you &apos;ll see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it on your desired size with the tool size . select a change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool for the size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels , if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality of quality , then try the mold for the blad@@ der . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation , for example of a picture . &amp; digi@@ came ; the algorithm has been developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to change the tools like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New size and are shown below :
&quot; when you exit jQuery Slider , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is necessary if you have a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ letin effect , the higher value of this value is necessary if you want a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ letin effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; each one can be used as a text file , and later be downloaded as a text file and later . &quot;
&quot; photo @-@ blad@@ der is very fast at what it makes , but it can take a very long time and a high CPU load . you can calculate the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example of a photo image by clicking a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the item ( 3 ) . the original ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard size compared to comparison .
you can drag the images ( folder ) to the image slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive .
&quot; if you look at the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . you can change the size of the right area by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ button , use the button to save the button &apos; button &apos; button and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by clicking the corners with the mouse button . the page ratio that you have defined in dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the standard format , you can remove the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross format of the width . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always equal to the side ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you are cen@@ timet@@ able , or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side dish . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons to top horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; below , you can cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected relation between the selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the image ratio depending on the image orientation ( Horizontal or Ver@@ tik@@ al ) , these settings will be stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data is stored in the EX@@ IF tables and not the original image . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
a harmon@@ ious triangle based on the principle of the simil@@ arity .
&quot; golden middle : golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a N@@ auti@@ lus mus@@ el or the Bl@@ eck@@ le leaves of a sun@@ flower . it is reflected in all possible things that we have seen as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and you already uses the old Egyptian pitch in all times when you use your images , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number comes from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot;
the golden centre provides liquid auxiliary lines if you put a picture . these aids can be found below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale is your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to third parties the golden spiral is produced by the image by the image . this kind of composition takes the view of the view along the line of the spiral and creates this kind of symmet@@ ric visual river .
&quot; another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also golden rect@@ angle . these rect@@ angles are used to guide the golden spiral . this can be a line of the composition of composition . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden triangle is not possible . di@@ agonal to these lines . di@@ agonal to these lines can be a static object . &quot;
&quot; if you use a golden triangle to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try your images fo@@ kus to one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangle . the result is a very attractive composition to you . &quot;
&quot; you can select the most suitable payment method : credit card , bank transfer , check , PayPal etc . &quot;
&quot; with the button colour , you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you can customize a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can adapt the color of the lines to your current picture . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
&quot; this creates a picture to repair the camera not exactly horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture , in which the things around a angle . you can repair the press line and select the target angle . &quot;
turn your image with the slide angle . the values of the window will be specified in degrees . the dialog box is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown above .
&quot; to position your help , the module must be a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse position in the picture to position the two lines . after you can mount it on one important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now select the angle as in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned into a picture , you will find unwanted short@@ cut holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transform@@ able from the window . &quot;
select one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ ases prevents the image a bit after turning .
all Peru@@ vian Trans@@ actions are conducted by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is displayed in the middle of the image and is displayed by a red circle .
to change the perspective you must use the red square rate to the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ loaded automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new picture , including the empty areas that were created by transformation and transformation . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new picture , including the empty areas that were created by transformation and transformation . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transform@@ able area .
&quot; right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transform@@ able area . &quot;
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transform@@ able area .
&quot; right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ formed district . &quot;
&quot; according to the adjustment of the perspective , the picture is a little effort . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments produce a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; the picture is used to move a part of the picture into a direction and to the other part in the opposite direction . this is not rotating , the picture will be cut into a parallel repository . &quot;

categories and special features can be shown in the preview view . if you want to show categories in D@@ re thumbnail view , you can add the characteristics to the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear that you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the gem@@ s will not be saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to finish the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; switch on the picture of paint from the context menu . to exit the M@@ alen menu , simply select the cross in the factory settings in the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ini@@ er , you &apos;ll need to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; don &apos;t control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you must be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can choose individual objects . then the properties will be displayed in the object features and the object in the wire modes . &quot;
you can also select several objects at the same time .
to add a new object in the object tree select the position to add the object you want to add the object you want to add the object in the toolbar and select a menu entry in the menu .
&quot; in order to select the right location , you can select the right position in order to select the right position : &quot;
&quot; with Delete either from the menu bar to edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove the selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have any characteristics , please click the user to take these modifications . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User document in the direction dialog , you can enter the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ reference for the item . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user document , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you do a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of the icon view . &quot;
&quot; press here , press on preview and a small example of the scene is selected with selected textiles , even if you wish to selected a part of texture image ( e.g. a texture within a texture Map and not the entire texture Map ) , cross them locally . &quot;
the screen displays the control points of the camera . you can pull up these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; if a transformation is selected , the control points and it is displayed a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position of the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a view to the image model , or as absolute value . you can only be indicated if they are selected or as absolute value . objects are only indicated when they selected are selected or equal to the factory settings of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ini@@ er ; has a window structure as a pre @-@ setting . the object tree and the object of object features are shown left and the four graphic page@@ views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like to choose the standard window order or if you need another arrangement , you can be able to save them if you want to save yourself from different directions . &quot;
&quot; to anch@@ ored a window over or under a present view , take the begin@@ ner to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , you draw the begin@@ ner to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be anch@@ ored on the right or left @-@ hand side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to have several views over each other , see the begin@@ ner in the middle of a different view . you can then change the views of clicking on the map sheet above to the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window walls are floating views : views , which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve the begin@@ ner to solve the begin@@ nings of the working area or click on the small to the left arrow down arrow inside the arrow . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross into the connecting bar . to prevent the lock , click on the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can paste additional views into the main window . on the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . &quot;
you can store the current window view with view window order ... save a dialog in which you can store the window fields under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can run it . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ own the current scene , click the icon Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu item View . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , s ini files . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon on the icon , click on the toolbar button or in the menu view of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... you will open the following Dialog : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that can see the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can pick up the width and height of the straight image . if you want to ren@@ ame a small area of the picture , choose the cross section sub@@ section and enter the picture section to the input field . &quot;
this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user interfaces . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user @-@ hand@@ book &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ;
&quot; if an image with only one of the pixel and pixel line , these pictures have often created a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or Stu@@ d effects in curves and lines , sometimes details are not shown in the display of smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ ases . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ ases to reduce the influence of this error . generally we see pictures with this property .
&quot; if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ ases , calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one of the pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has been calculated using the number of pixels . if the difference between the color values , the pixels will be calculated by 4x4 additional points to be calculated in a depth value of 5 and 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels will be calculated : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue and the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
Di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the re@@ winding method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the colour values the pre @-@ set @-@ set , the pixels will be sent individually and to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be set with a deep value . &quot;
&quot; a further way to reduce the ali@@ ases effect , the creation of rough@@ ness for the Stra@@ hl process , is called J@@ ess@@ ing . if you turn to a tiny amount , changes and Po@@ v@@ ray ; the radiation around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is a experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use of light reflex is calculated . it takes a very long to calculate a scene with this property .
this card card allows you to set whether the alpha channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray .

on this page you can change existing windows or create new window pane . in the section window pane is explained how you can create windows and store .
this combination of standard window frames : displays all existing objects . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ y@@ he uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of window list shows all existing modules . a new arrangement allows you to delete and delete a selected arrangement with the button button .
the name must be identified through the name . the name must be clearly visible and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window order .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you will get a new column on the right side of the existing window , with a card card view , with the previous window , with the previous view , and replace the view on the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ini@@ er ; installed and now you want to follow any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow any steps in this tutorial , you should choose the ultimate but simple scene , among the begin@@ nings of a ball . &quot;
&quot; however , you should specify the following warnings as a result just a black screen . if you want to use a 3D program , you should note these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set any camera , no rules for the ren@@ ders will be used as a result . &quot;
you can paste it in any place on your page where you want to add image slider .
&quot; if you have any faul@@ ty installed , you can see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ r ; following the window below : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to learn the menus and the existing icons of the factory settings . read the documentation , so you can expect a reasonable idea what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will often use these menus and symbols , so you should use the menus and symbols and even their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; in particular , this is the result of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this is the result of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
the object tree contains a new entry with the name camera .
&quot; change it at the basic settings of the camera , this is a later date settings , but note that the camera in the control points you can easily change the target point of the camera . click on the left mouse button and pull it out to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button to button or button button , the wire model views and the object is immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could be able to add a Qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a clear method for this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ini@@ er , you can use an easier way . you can use an infinite level than ground : &quot;
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button to the button . in the object tree the new name will be immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows the level of the plane , even when the moment is just a limited level . if you are the scene , the plane to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you see the object tree , you will find that you can find the entry for the floor . in this case you can find the standard options for any new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and locking . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the object of the object . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should know the ground to exercise a unit under the Horizontal line , just to be able to get some of these parameters . select report and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; choose the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose from the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog is displayed in which you can choose to choose the object in the object . you can see the name in the object view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ment is just a ther@@ es black material because you have to use the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
if you don &apos;t see the color on Qu@@ ader and ball click on the button and then call the preview .
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you have a click on the icon , you should get the result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colour . you can also be able to enter the colour list of the color list . select this entry twice ( you can also be more common , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose the object tree any time and change the colors in the object of the object :
&quot; this step should be able to run , as you should be able to run the basic method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ini@@ er ; you should also know how to create the ground as well as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the lenses , you can immediately change the settings for the radi@@ us : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or button users ) , so the ball can be moved to the floor . otherwise the ball would have the ground over the ground , as you have the ground to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ ders is now a strange result : as already previously , the ball surface like a ther@@ es black material . contact you in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the ball you can now have a material supply , you can now enter a material as a colour : &quot;
&quot; select First Sur@@ ment and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , choose one colour and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish characteristics :
change the values as in the following screen photos and click the input button .
&quot; the settings of shine effect and reflection does not contain good visual effects , perfect for glass or satin surfaces , even if Met@@ alli@@ sch : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which means you will have a good impression that you can easily create a simple but nice scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ yc@@ ler is a R@@ ender method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; by contrast , the visual effects of the image ( i.e. of the camera that reflect the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see you without a camera , the camera is just black . obviously , any scene , the image is just black . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .

a B@@ ump Map is a way to create a rough surfaces without any bending on the surface and to change without the geomet@@ ric shape of the object .
it is common to use the same file both for a B@@ ump Map as well as a Tex@@ ture map .
basic ones are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can be used as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements .
a Tex@@ ture map is a way to give an image to the surface of an object in pixels using an image file as a color map .

Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok hasn &apos;t added any own command options . &quot;
&quot; you should give a feedback when the script is not executed if the script is not executed , please check if all the modules are present and use the dialog so that the user is not running . &quot;

&quot; in the folders button , you will find a lot of template @-@ script in many different languages . you can quickly find that the writing of script is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can control your script by Amar@@ ok , and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; , which each K@@ DE installation should be given . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the alignment of external programs and commands . in this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here an example of Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; your default script is written in the default script . for this reason , the script is subject to the default value of the script . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for this . &quot;
&quot; if a script is started , Amar@@ ok the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored on the folder where all data is stored . &quot;
please note that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features more information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the volume length ) .
&quot; high volume change , volume signals is a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 . &quot;
&quot; select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to add image slider . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; changed , or if the user has a script stop@@ pt , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. the storage of data or configuration settings . &quot;
* Open the generated &apos; engine / style@@ .c@@ ss &apos; file and open it in any text editor .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept the script packages with a very long @-@ script script type . this reason you should accept your script packages correctly .
the key argument must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) that should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file right to the file :
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sliders into the same page !

&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . &quot;
&quot; under the audio format , the information contained in the audio format that lose information through data compressed by using a lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ odes are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be delivered with most distri@@ butions , but it &apos;s open license for questions . &quot;

MP3 - if music also belongs to other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB flash , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list with parameters for audio quality and the compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually vary for most people and most of the music pieces are acceptable . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less complex parts of the unit . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a Tit@@ els . good Gen@@ ocide for music from young , portable devices and Auto@@ colli@@ sion systems . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have the absolute highest quality , you choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; CD ; information , the manually entered or by the program automatically out of the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be used as a list of parameters . they can be used as a list of parameters . they can be used as a list of parameters . they can be used as a list of parameters as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for co@@ di@@ ver and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;

this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audiovisual ; parameters that can be used to be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , which can be read in the audio CDs that can be downloaded from text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces , etc . , not by the audio file himself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the Knowledge : that is the author of the CD ; more or less valuable , so it can be done by the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so it can be done by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; PayPal , Bank Transfer Price : EUR@@ 10.00 Shipping ( Standard ) : EUR@@ 1.@@ 50 Add@@ to@@ Shopping@@ Cart No.@@ 47 &quot;
&quot; there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ Byte ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ography will be used to be used in the network and like the load between the computers . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , a current list of mirror servers for online requests from &amp; CD . alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( in the rule monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which out@@ les@@ e@@ program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors to be used in the source code .... This was the best choice for the reading of audio CD ; refer to note that the German par@@ ano@@ ia package is already installed from the right distribution , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; you can select the file format for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on this tab card . &quot;
the co@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the specific Linux distribution . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a co@@ di@@ er@@ er you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame - help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
&quot; this can be a lot of causes . check the setup of the device name &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing - and only real @-@ use of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) . try to enter both programs with a command line into a terminal . &quot;
check whether you are not able to read a copy of audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this is not required !
there is a chapter with a step by step . even if you use other settings you can enter the tips on how to go .
&quot; if you want to read the complete manual , everything must always be understood ? now , no problem , follow this step for instance , and you will get enough information to establish the program that you want to make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything up and our first &amp; CD ; we will read l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use for MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable Bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be used as a search engine for your Linux distribution . both programs should be found as pre @-@ free packages for your Linux distribution . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files . in any case , it is not necessary to compile the source files . &quot;
&quot; please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is , and you have the writing to copy it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the Kon@@ quer@@ or something into copy ) . &quot;
&quot; &lt; 1 &quot; &quot; Tablets , &lt; ! -- End WOWSlider.com BODY section -- &gt; ... &lt; / head &gt; &lt; body &gt; &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any age &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; for example , we determine the associated code of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings , we will probably not be able to read these settings . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the execution programme so that the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently used / dev / c@@ bn is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this doesn &apos;t work or more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed in the file / etc / f@@ box and try it with the existing entry of the device name for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
&quot; here is a lot of converting to do adjustments . here , a additional transformation can be defined in our example , everything will be shown as in the screen photo . &quot;
&quot; in case of incomplete information , you will be informed that you will be informed if you are informed about failure of stit@@ ch ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive . &quot;
&quot; note : the calculator must be shared during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet , he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server . &quot;
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , when you later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the user name , you can easily be modified with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to use everything manually , you want to use the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b you can use the database . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is available for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for the call &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b Server via the Internet . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB Server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and have a look at a mirror server in your area .
&quot; when the protocol is concerned , there is a lot of more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surfing on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server error . &quot;
take the settings of the screen photo ( make sure that the folder / tmp on your computer exists )
&quot; at the same time , there is a reason why more than one at the same time , there is a reason why more than one at the same time only a existing drive ? parallel to reading and co@@ ders ? the author does not know how to try it . &quot;
&quot; CD : after reading the last piece , check out this at around the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user defined folders for temporary files : if you are specified in the folder , the files will be stored in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; everything so easy as it is on the screen photo . the command is something long , under the circumstances you need to look at the right side to see everything . &quot;
&quot; this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
check the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; id@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags can be mistakenly deleted . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; quot ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables to the name of the input ( including full path ) and the output file ( including full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; at the same time , to fix WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ ro@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than one WAV file is at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is , we have chosen the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ device ; and this configuration is used as standard for any read of a &amp; CD ; if you have selected the organizational structure of your music feed , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section is described in this section , as the process of the editing &amp; CD ; on the hard disk , the kind of music on the hard drive is described , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , that is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos will be a bit different from the Internet . &quot;
try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet happen , the &amp; CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the windows are listed below , as in the screen photo . this only when the &amp; CD ; identified as a Audio CD ; it could be read and by automated par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen if you are looking for any questions and answers to the help or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD is successfully checked by the fre@@ ed@@ b point , all the titles of the pieces are filled out and also shown the name of the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; for the case , there is more than a entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; and you can select the database entry to your opinion after your CD . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have the An@@ alogue for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also use this manually by choice of the first bu@@ op@@ fs in the toolbar , but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e @-@ s 02 : the CD Editor - entry of the CD data and the Tit@@ els of the first step
&quot; please enter the dates for your &amp; CD ; according to the patterns on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artists must not be entered in the input source fields , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
the complete comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ cal per piece that are used for comments the comment field of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after successful completion of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editing is not empty , but it contains the data like in the following screen photo . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editing . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v1 tags . this is the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artists , album and titles of a unit and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 , you have unlimited field length , at least in the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the day information of the files later with the tag editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files . you can also create id@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
&quot; tags will not be supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help of Ko@@ di@@ ver to get more information . &quot;
&quot; in this example , this is not important because we are not over@@ coming to the style of the actual CD ; it is not important because we are unable to read the information about fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . Pop or Photos for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window , just click the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the windows of the CD Edi@@ tors appear again , and you see that the fields are recorded for the album already have been recorded for the first piece . simply give the entries for the fields of the current volume . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and procedures you have entered the same way until you have entered the title data of the CD .
attention : this window will not be downloaded when you download the data from fre@@ ed@@ b you can download in one of these categories .
it is the third button of the factory tool . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the unit list .
&quot; please note that there are a check characters before each line of a unit . only the title is marked as marked by the selection of the unit on or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or add the button to select all the pieces on the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces . &quot;
click on the button to read the read process . click OK and then we will get a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens .
&quot; click on the button to switch on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window for control of orders . the first piece will be read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left @-@ bottom of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ ver that you have not been installed with a red &apos; X &apos; in the tables .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the release of the first step . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , he is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read the status on the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings , to read this behavior . &quot;
&quot; this is a small window with a message for a short time , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ device , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.@@ x and d@@ ost par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ di@@ ver of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you read the package of C@@ VS , you can download the package from your distribution . if you read with C@@ VS , you can read the package &apos;s package from your distribution . if you read this , you have already done it ... &quot;
this section is directed to people who use the source files and not for users who use a pre @-@ made package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different types of programs , has many variations of settings . &quot;

supports both existing standards in order to store text in MIDI files ( light conditions or tex@@ tures ) .
&quot; support support . if you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the play of a song , starts K@@ mid at the next time again with the same song . &quot;
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and G@@ US Cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; firstly , you can choose from the menu file . it will be the common file dialog with its help you can choose to choose the same song . &quot;
you can also use a file of a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ gon ; -@@ window drop down . this works also with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and move the button to play in the tool box , select the entry button from the menu item from or manually select the space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , once you draw it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will be added to a collection and then played each other one . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can use any position by clicking the middle mouse button and drive along with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is fast or slow down , you can change the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ v click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button is a pressure on the button or on the track of the menu item in the menu , so the sound is played during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ gon ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ ed@@ articles can be saved on two types in a music piece . some pieces of Tex@@ ter@@ ings , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ tual and again other both of these pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set up which events will be displayed automatically and even better : the event type is used automatically , so you can set it manually . if you want to change it manually , the kar@@ ao@@ ke text is automatically selected . you have still the possibility to change this way if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to set an event type , select from the menu settings . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you may compre@@ hend . this section of the series is played in this section such as you can use collections .
&quot; to open a collection , open the collection manager . click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then click the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original songs .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set up the recording manager in the distribution manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add any other collection to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when using the application , this collection is not stored . take care if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it has to add a song to add a song to add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog with its help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation Add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic add to the collection , a piece is added to open ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when your collection is not activated , when opening a unit the temporary collection is activated and yellow . this collection will then be added to the previously opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you will open the collection manager , the collection and the desired song and then click Remove button . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the number from the menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order , as they have been added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order is newly defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the package manager , or use the drop down list of the Kar@@ ao@@ ke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song on a song , choose the button next song out of the menu or press the button to the right arrow . &quot;
&quot; to jump back into one song , select the button signs from the menu or press the button arrows . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select where to delete the collection and click the buttons . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection may not be mistakenly deleted . however , however , there is no role as it will be saved by &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izer that are not General @-@ MIDI . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thes@@ izer .
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type change into English to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always a trumpet player if originally a piano should play a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you have only a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI files because all sound cards are compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) . &quot;
there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you must edit the corresponding file of the hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that make all necessary parameters for the play of a unit .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which is so often appear as desired . &quot;

you see that Def@@ ine is used to see that a section begins ( except for Options ) and END that the end of an end can be achieved .
&quot; please send me your Map file as a E @-@ mail , that I can offer other versions of &amp; k@@ etch@@ ; support for devices that are not compatible with General MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
this section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific interface . the general use is as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equilibrium is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that supports this instrument with the number M . if your keyboard is supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) .
&quot; when now a MIDI file is a note , it patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , independent of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum @-@ patch of the patch , in which each sound is another keyboard instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) , and not one who is the sound of the sound as a sound is the same drum . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section will be used to specify the sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of the lines is very important , and their presence is very important . you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define for each channel and every instrument you need to define several key@@ note .

this section can be used to form some channels to other channels . if you want to exchange the first and second channel we will make it easy to the first and the second channel .
&quot; however , these settings is useful for Key@@ boards , which have the Per@@ formers on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; 16 lines , the CHAN@@ NE@@ L@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be used to change this channel . if you want to use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map must change the patch to change this channel . in this case , the patch is used to change this channel . &quot;
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to use the Per@@ k@@ screen patch on the per@@ tin@@ ge channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is used in which relation to pitch @-@ B@@ ender events multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file is a pitch @-@ file event , this with the formula + ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is used to be opened in the Map file ( s / 40@@ 96 ) . &quot;
this setting is used because GM is to play a keyboard that will play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound . unfortunately we try to find some key@@ boards to play two sounds up to a oc@@ ta@@ ve .
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in menu settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole row pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) .
&quot; you can use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a tool , which is not more green but red to show that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view ( up to now ) two different views to show the fet@@ ched sounds .
&quot; the speed LCD display shows the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find a song be fast to follow the text , you can change it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file , the information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this can also play the same MIDI file on two different devices as well as two different musicians the same notes on very different ways . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file doesn &apos;t need a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also use a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thes@@ izer . at a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed and etc . you have the control over all . &quot;
&quot; you can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , De@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ nica ; without A@@ we support com@@ promises . &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a full folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; open the folder where you want to add or delete the folder , select all files , and pull them on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
specify a value for this required field . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can add the arrow button on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to play the playback . to click the standard temp@@ o to the LCD double click on the LCD screen .
&quot; I have been working on a &amp; k@@ de ; working area of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ gon ; on this way , I have to play a file , just in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and in the window where I want to play a file in the window of &amp; k@@ gon . &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a folder without having to add a collection to a collection , switch the setting up to a collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection added . &quot;
&quot; for example , you have to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ D. , you will only want to play the first file . so , you will find the setting up to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains this a MIDI file . &quot;

all changes are lost when the processing mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .

there is a tab for configuration of mp@@ layer in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer . here you can set the path of mp@@ layer and the intermediate storage size of the disk space from the network and other things .
a different tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool box . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
&quot; there is no reason for this play@@ list in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer . everything must be configured with manual editing of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , such as a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla : &quot;
&quot; &apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer , it can be played within &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; it can even be played in the play@@ list for YouTube in the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; so the &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer , has to be specified in HTML pages , it must be specified in a service provider for the M@@ LS type . / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave wave flash in the installation dialog box is specified by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; a console or &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer , is used in a console application and to send error messages , the back@@ end output within &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be done . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be re@@ directed to all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mp@@ layer ; can be used from TV cards , either by mp@@ layer or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Tuner ) . it can be used to use the configuration and the TV channels , the scanner can be used manually or the configuration file . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video data transfer ) settings in the c@@ mp@@ layer , the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ ilt - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port , the correct name has to be found . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of k@@ mp@@ layer can only use X@@ Video to use X@@ Video , it should also function to work X@@ video . this is also supported by the video server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;

this action is assigned to the keyboard short@@ cut . with the button of the button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ est .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ achable settings and in design of the action will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually script , but it is not limited ) to change the document or input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ home / my@@ Script@@ .@@ sh .
&quot; in this way , it is recommended to use the % script@@ access to the command line , like sh % script@@ access / my@@ sq@@ .@@ sh@@ . on this way , the script is trying to upload them in the command : $ PAT@@ H It &apos;s other special variable which can be used in command line : $ PAT@@ H It &apos;s other special variable which can be used in the command line : $ PAT@@ H It &apos;s other special variable which can be used in command line : &quot;
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document file : / out of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is replaced , the Text can be used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from external script . &quot;
the parameters for this event is normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above methods , a script is written by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the default input field , you can be able to send the default input to the default input field . options are : &quot;
selected Text : the selected field of the document is sent to the script .
&quot; according to the entry , there are two types of issue : normal output , which can be written on standard version ; error messages , on the standard version . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the application language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a factory tool with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a work tool is added , you must add actions and configure your settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window opens the Edit mode .
fill in all the fields and add the tag to the matching work .
&quot; complete all and , if the day attributes , and you have to plan your use , enable the dialog box to enable dialog . &quot;
Ig@@ or ! is the ugly symbol . who should be the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ fer ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics , other programs ( or where otherwise it is in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; by default 3@@ 2x@@ 32 pixels , we need to change it 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose size . &quot;
&quot; please note that this symbol does not only help you to mem@@ orize what the action is , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; to create paragra@@ phs , you simply leave blank lines . ) &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the icon , it must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button to press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the saved symbol is , choose it and confirm it with OK . &quot;
press the button and put them in other tags that are still there or confirm it in OK .
&quot; therefore , you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the functions of the toolbar add or it should be divided into several groups . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ et ( very left above ) for my work tool . after the selection of the element , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the work@@ load . &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the factory settings . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the crow@@ ns support the group . someone who do not know my work tool , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button was the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new work tool must be tested by pro@@ b@@ ating all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; backup in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your work@@ space will be stored in the right folder . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the chosen extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal users , the opportunity to add the documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language that you might like to share a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process .
&quot; to select the location of your project , just click the Browse folders button and choose a different location . &quot;
the section tree defined the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation for this :

&quot; the section of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is to be displayed in the context of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation would be indicated directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding agreement . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; now you can store your file doc@@ r@@ c to store and say to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / credit / Qu@@ anta / doc , or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / credit / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these good and it worth , you will send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work plac@@ ements with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by E@@ Mail to friends , partners or otherwise to be sent . an email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) is available in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and folders in the embed tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can also be made in our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it as correctly and used for the publication . if our team is checked , the resources are checked and used for the publication of the search , both for our team as well as for the later user . &quot;
&quot; when you exit the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored in the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case you can choose a dialog . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive . &quot;
&quot; after the download of a resource , before installing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the Un@@ vers@@ ation of the resource is given to note . if the integrity given , and it can be done correctly . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML languages which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files may be required to convert a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD shop and convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description . then the following Dialog :

&quot; setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter is trying to bring these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : Global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction is a series of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each one , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved to the group of administr@@ ators , actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements make a personal collection of Web development projects for a single user . this are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ pieces . local elements are stored in the user directory so that it can only use this user .
project related elements are available within a specific project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ ate , Bau@@ manager , the Bau@@ manager with information and the work@@ stations . please check in , and for more information about this area . &quot;
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , like the current , other or all cart@@ ons , then delete or delete the document , jump to a bookmark or version of C@@ VS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; in the editing area of the editing pane , the document content of the document contents ( cutting / paste / paste ) , processing of the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , when the string is specified under the mouse po@@ inter or open the file , when the string is specified below the mouse po@@ inter . &quot;

&quot; the use of work@@ pieces is really easy . if they want to add a day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that the day represents a day to fill in a dialog of different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ manager ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to open and open to the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , and to open it . in the presentation with cartridges are available for files , project , templates , attributes , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; this view shows all files in the project and allows the saving of files in the project and allows the saving of files in the project by rectangular mouse . actions such as add , remove , over@@ load or delete files from the disk medium can be done using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another way of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the use of templates . almost everything can be a template . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how to use them . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates are available for the corresponding user and templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the development in Global , Lok@@ al and project works here . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can set the internal structure of the active document . &quot;
this tree appears under the other Bau@@ manager . with him can change the content of all available attributes in a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web @-@ technology for your development . you can download the documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project file . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for Compare . why is &amp; gt ; ? let me explain why I have written .
&quot; the meeting was very complicated , because one of the contribution to many changes have been modified at the same time . another programming was changed in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program showed me only the changed lines , I could not see what exactly was changed within this lines . &quot;
&quot; the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be added within a line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions are added . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare fast text , copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , the items and collapse of folders . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when two people will work independently . this is useful if two people work independently from each other to a piece of co@@ de , and to make changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps to resolve conflicts and shows the same result in this editor , you can even edit the result in this editor . the screen photo shows three qu@@ ell files when joining : &quot;

&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible in a certain number of white characters , you can see a look at the summary in the column on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in a line , then the color is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ pping work easier to write the first file . sample : &quot;

&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual installation of file names , which can also be used with the file browser ( file ... ) or the next open file from the file list . if you do not have a third file , the analysis of differences with two files will be done with two files . &quot;
&quot; if you select a folder , you can select a folder , then use a folder , then use the folder for B &amp; C but a folder , then use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filename can be used from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not necessary to set the input field to the target . it is not necessary to define a output file . you can also recommend this step later when saving them . &quot;
the set button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the product list .
&quot; sometimes you would like to select a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window . &quot;
&quot; you can also use a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor , and let it fall over a comparison list . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it ? sometimes it contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would like to create two corresponding files , they would like to copy and then compare and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can change nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text is supported by text in a comparison window .

&quot; when a difference is detected , you can distinguish for the color of the red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color sch@@ ema is especially useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( joining ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text , the column matching the corresponding color . if differences were found , the column matching the corresponding color . when differences were found in white characters , the colour is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant modifications . &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which is connected to the text column , is activated at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the time limit is activated , the line is displayed on a broken lines . &quot;
&quot; results appear ordered &quot; &quot; by relevance &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; by date &quot; &quot; ( publication date ) , &quot;
&quot; here ! ! ! until all the conflicts are dis@@ solved , it is dis@@ solved ! ! ! ( use the buttons for easy @-@ to @-@ use conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two phases can be used , each difference is also solved with a conflict of manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the window , the line is displayed in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in the windows where the first line of the group will not be visible in the windows where the beginning of the group will not be visible on the left of the group . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it remains in the automatic compilation , or by manual editing , no more in the group . then it is not only possible to choose that you may change your opinion and maybe another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark that you might copy and see another source . &quot;

&quot; note : if at the end of the springs the options numbers ignore or remove C / C + + Comments , changes in numbers or reviews as well as white characters . &quot;

&quot; one click with the left mouse button into one of the right mouse button , the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section , and the edi@@ able output is explained ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool box contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can find the current / first / last difference between the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g above ) , for the next / former conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g above ) , for the next / former conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark into the clipboard , you need to copy the copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g insert ) . &quot;

&quot; select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also works with variable width , you should not use this but not use . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in this font . if the selected Scrip@@ ture does not support this representation is not supported . &quot;
&quot; with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would not be displayed in its pure form . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the corresponding number is inserted . otherwise , a tablet computer is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when connecting or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line automatically is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , every selection will be copied into the clipboard . &quot;
you can select which you prefer mode type you prefer . the default value is the general choice of the operating system used .
&quot; in this step , white characters are not ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) on some systems ( on some systems ) , a host run &apos;@@ \ \ r &apos; and a time @-@ run &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again , though they are different . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of analysis are ignored and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored in the result , however , they will be treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
inten@@ sely searching for smaller differences . this option is activated in the pre @-@ setting . it is effective at complex and large files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; as long as long as long as long as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next evolution of conflict will continue . &quot;
this is useful when white characters are less important when white characters are less important . if you need this is useful when white characters are less important when the white characters are less important when the options have been used in numbers or reviews if the options are ignore or delete C / C + + -@@ comments .
&quot; these options will be treated in the chapter for scanning of folders and lead to a merger . look for details under documentation of documentation and compilation . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version , the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version , it will be deleted without additional backup . &quot;
( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it is not available because the language is subject to the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set for each entry . if you activated this option will be used for all entries the upper setting .
&quot; over the selection fields for the encoding , a short note that the local code is appears . ( this can not be changed , and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
adjust the file encoding for source files .
&quot; if you have a file , you can set up a file that will be used to save the code . &quot;
&quot; if you define processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( e.g. , your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ process command can only be configured with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
note : this applies also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore numbers or comments if the options are ignore or delete C / C + + -@@ comments . )
this selection is only available when you are viewing three files .
sometimes I would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . Bl@@ ends you simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
this can be useful to the ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; in addition , you can select the differences and decide the file name when you use only two files . if you use only two files , if you use only two files , if you use only two files . if you use only two files , the name of the last source file is specified as the name of the last source file , then the name of the last updated output file . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is visible in this remote command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own preferences , which is precisely your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is specified in this remote command ( see above ) , then the output of command will only be used in the command line . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to enable users more flexibility to set up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would like to program the good news . the good news is however , that in most cases or per@@ l completely . &quot;

&quot; C@@ VS and other version control systems use some key words to add a text file ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same patterns of the text file , which will be automatically generated by the text : * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed experiments , you may perhaps understand it , and perhaps you may even help these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that are very similar things . &quot;
&quot; from numbers it is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ loaded function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you would like to perform multiple align@@ ments on once . then , you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate them from each other . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can also use some different details such as per@@ l used . per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos; s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Er@@ rors / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; allergi@@ es are needed to per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &quot; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; depending on the normal pre@@ processor , the data can only change the data that change the line of the po@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the po@@ inter @-@ pre@@ processor uses the output of normal pre@@ processor . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences , you may be able to note certain differences in the worst case . &quot;
often you need to edit and merge any files in a folder .
... makes for every object for joining us ; you can customize the proposal before starting the start
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ate and shows the simulated changes without them to do without them .
... you selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 @-@ button ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 @-@ button ) ;
this is the password and joining one files very similar . you need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if there are three folders , folder is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the target folder . &quot;
note that only the comparison of folders will not lead to the meeting . to start the meeting you have to select the corresponding menu entry or the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow )
&quot; during the reading of the folder , you will find a small news window on the current progress . if you get the scanning of the folder , you will get the files listed above . &quot;
&quot; if the scanning of the folder is completed , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ... &quot;
each file and each folder of the scan is found in a tree . you can select a object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is normally displayed in a folder , by clicking on the + / - click on the left / right , or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file double , the file comparison started , and there appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type in the other folders is different , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window on the selected object . in such a case you can not be automatically selected by this type . &quot;
&quot; as in the above picture , you will be used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries is the colour , however , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are identical if you are not identical if you are identical contents . then you can also folder the same color . at folders , the age is not considerably reduced for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this ink sch@@ ema is based on im@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green is then yellow and later when it is old . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A not exists , delete the target , if there exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C not the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as such a faul@@ ty objects can exist . &quot;
... A and B not the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder , and when the option are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action will be identical to both the folder . if you are identical to a entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical .
&quot; when two folders are stored and the option ( un@@ safe ) is activated , then the date of files and pro@@ poses the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical , but the date is identical . &quot;
&quot; while combining a file after the other runs , the Status column shows that if the meeting was successful , and according to other messages if the merger is completed , you should see a final review and see if the status is everywhere in order . &quot;
&quot; if in the direction dialog is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further sp@@ ends . these contain the number of le@@ ased elements , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts will only be shown in three folder or together . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either choose the straight selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected the watch actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the compilation . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have any target folder , then it will be used as a target , when two folders , the B as the target , will be selected and / or B as a goal . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , check whether all entries are displayed in the target folder , you can also be displayed in the folder structure . &quot;
&quot; to follow all entries : select directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ ened ) to select the current element , select the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if by contradic@@ ting data types are still incorrect actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can select a valid action . &quot;
&quot; if you conduct all entries , a dialog window appears to simul@@ ate the options , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see if you would like to see what would happen , without the really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; if you are ready to start using a file , select the directory and press F@@ 7 . if you are not logged in , a corresponding dialog . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error message , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to add the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries are individually led together , see &amp; gt ; this entry ( in the current session ) and it will not be saved once again . even if you can change this entry , this entry will be saved once again . &quot;
&quot; the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) , now a section called directory named with these options : &quot;
&quot; only files that are displayed on the specified patterns will be displayed in the element tree . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that comply with this pattern will not be indicated as a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default setting is * .@@ int ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that comply with this pattern will not be indicated as a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default setting is * .@@ int ; * .@@ O . &quot;
there are ignored files that may also be ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder has to be set by C@@ VS . ( see the info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
in some file systems you can select a file name as hidden . this option allows you to decide whether these files can be indicated in the element sheet or not . this option is activated in the default setting .
&quot; with links on files : if the option is switched off , the files are compared to the links . this is indicated in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is activated , the links are treated and re@@ arranged . &quot;
&quot; it provides a full analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ conditional , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is more s@@ lower than a simple binding analysis , and substantially s@@ lower when it is applied to files that does not contain text . ( enter a appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re large folders via a slow@@ ing network , it may be faster , only the share of share and the file size . &quot;
&quot; similar to the terms of terms . it is no real comparison instead of . the files are considered as identical if they are equal . this can be useful if you are equal . this option is useful in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared , and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are identical to which both folders are identical . this option is stored in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there is differences , the copy of newer file is proposed as action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because it will be the knowledge that the other file doesn &apos;t change . ) This option is not changed in any case . ) This option is available in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced with the .@@ original file extension , the original version is ren@@ amed and receives the original backup file with the .@@ original file extension . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folders can be visible in the window . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window frames with the mouse button . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window windows in the window menu and using the change between directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; if you want to save a file with double @-@ click it , you can also use a corresponding menu item . &quot;
&quot; this status is lost , if you read the directory again : directory menu : new , read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparent by K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read from files and folders .
the second command line is a local file with a FTP server . the second command line is similar to a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folder .
&quot; a path can be relatively free . or .. , this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolutely absolutely . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system at the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; the FTP port is normally located on port 21 thus this has been pre@@ filled for you already . if you want to send us a question about this product , simply complete all the fields marked * and click &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit content or change This document , so soft the user or change of change from the original . ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; at K@@ Devel@@ op , K@@ Devel@@ op start the right mouse button at K@@ Devel@@ op . K@@ Devel@@ op start the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part can be found out of the context menu . &quot;

&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and from the context menu preview , please note that this does not work if the original file exists . it is un@@ reliable , if the original file has been changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part is executed , it supports only the number of two files , a very small tool @-@ tool and menu . the connection or the Compare of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now known comm@@ p@@ are ) , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 has already heard that it can lead to diff@@ use such as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
this is my thank you to the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers that have gone out or go to it .
&quot; you have the program of the sources and the FTP script is probably not the correct Pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting , K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. for diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines should be treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor can only be saved for any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . this is necessary to create a conflict in the source code and direction of the Kn@@ op@@ ard A / B / C / C / C / C / C / C / C / C . &quot;
the effort was to be too large . you can use a certain version of a source A / B / C file . in order to edit larger quantities of text should be used to a different editor .

&quot; to help people to help people to help people to help people to help people with the RS@@ I Syn@@ drome ( re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ point syndrome ) , and those of each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this is a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people to help people to help people with the re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome . moreover , it can also be a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can create the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse , and helps to use pain without pain . unfortunately , you can find a doctor that is not yet done with the use of your computer if it is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; in order to turn it once again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to prevent the mouse with the mouse , it is used against pain which is caused by the mouse over the mouse , the result can be avoided for each other . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click , as soon as you can break the movement in short . &quot;
&quot; this way you can run the mouse , waiting it up to the end of the movement , so you can move the mouse at the end of the movement . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the mouse moves to the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; with the mouse button on the mouse button , the rotary field camera is set up ( 1 / 10 s ) . here is the time set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button takes place , when the mouse takes place on the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to install web site jquery slider using jQuery Slider in any test folder on a local drive . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; you can move the response time to short@@ ening the response time . open to the sound and multimedia , choose the sound system and here the tab . there is a sliding sound buffer that you can set up to a lower value to save the response times . &quot;
&quot; this function is marked , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; it is available only under &amp; k@@ de ; it is available for the respective documentation to find out how to start there a program . &quot;
&quot; the settings are pressed onto the settings when opening the dialog box , you will set the button to reset the settings on the last load of users . &quot;
&quot; first use you &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the settings . in particular , the intelligent use should be used to be used later . if you click on the automatic mouse click it , you can later be able to push the smart for@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; if you use the plug @-@ in @-@ click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at intervals . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click on the neutral content of windows or in the browser window , you cannot edit the mouse to such places , until you want to use them . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is clean , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you are not only the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to take the mouse ball . as this happens , the mouse is different from the mouse . it should be clear if you want to view the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have the ball , you have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the locom@@ otive , into the ball and the dirt can easily be easily with a flat blade or the nails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system is started by &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you do not use this smart way , means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot end up with the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under another window manager and window manager .
the solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can work as usual .
&quot; to select a html page , just click the Open HTML page button and choose page where you want to add image slider . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the mouse button at a neutral area , if you want to use it . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent push , but I don &apos;t want to edit it so that text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent push is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time to copy it , to copy it into the clipboard and to add any other action at which you want to copy it into the clipboard . &quot;
use the smart gri@@ pper if you just start to start &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . select text you can move on the other end of the text and keep the mouse position on the other end of the text and keep the mouse button again .
&quot; use the mouse click . thus , the mouse click on the mouse button . then you can use the mouse button as a mouse click . so , you can use the smart version even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be the case in most cases , it should be the case . &quot;
the functionality of the mouse clicks is only available when the system features a sound card and loudspeaker .
&quot; this program was developed for people , who suffer from the mouse po@@ inter . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can be installed so that there is a certain time to be waiting for a time of time , before the mouse button will be executed before the mouse can also be executed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ s will be the last sign of the text , so that a common character must be inserted . the complete command is therefore more complex than in other examples : &quot;

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , which enables the management of network interface , routine and DNS settings . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ fz @-@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and Des@@ kt@@ op@@ center via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ fz @-@ center ; can be accessed by selecting the K menu k@@ fz @-@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf package has been developed to make the use of the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings of the TCP / IP network settings for the user a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installing a new module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ s.php ; ) , the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting by k@@ fz @-@ Center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network Hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have already been able to install and configur@@ able to configure &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is needed and set the setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers are used for network hardware and other equipment when installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . &quot; network devices later , the driver must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings is loaded when the option settings is loaded in &amp; k@@ fz @-@ center ; -@@ Index selected , when the module &apos;s network settings is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform is not recognized , the suspension layout is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the Rel@@ eas@@ ant . &quot;
the change in network settings is possible only in the system management mode .
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three steps : &quot;
the rider network interface serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed in the following tasks :
the settings of the network interface can be configured by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialogue device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button to select the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings will be carried out with the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings is required for the system at any system . the TCP / IP settings is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system , the TCP / IP settings can be selected according to DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manuals without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , the TCP / IP address will be specified . in the input field mas@@ ke is the sub@@ network mas@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization is not enabled , this option should not be activated . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog , values are displayed as features of the device in the device . &quot;
it should be ensured that the IP address should not already be used in the network . the input of an existing IP address would be asked to enable a TCP / IP conflict .
&quot; if you want to use network devices can be activated or switched off , on a sign@@ post @-@ related network device is activated by selecting from the list and click the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can also be activated or switched off . switching off a activated network device is done by selecting from the list and click the interface , ... &quot;
&quot; the IP address of the computer is firmly firmly established , the physical connection to distant networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface is available to the network which is located in the gat@@ eway computer . &quot;
this is necessary because computers can be replaced with DNS server . this is necessary because computers only can understand the IP address as a IP address as about 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the calculator to name this list has been added to a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button to add a DNS server , a DNS server can add a DNS server . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group computer , select a entry and click the button .... It is displayed in the Edit menu . &quot;
&quot; in small , closed networks can be used in the first line if there is no DNS server . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;

&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then click the list of the static Ho@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in the module network settings , settings are not immediately available in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly used machines ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of finished version is recommended for less experienced users .
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool is used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development of libraries are needed . &quot;
this is recommended only experienced users . it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ to compile . the following commands should contribute to this .

&quot; one of the most important information is aware of the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is accessible . in a foreign networks , the network administrator , the response is not just sent to DH@@ CP . &quot;
&quot; when recording a own little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially designed area for this purpose , to avoid IP address of the global ( Internet ) network . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be used by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , generally speaking addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 , the area is large enough . &quot;

&quot; before a band can be used , it must be deleted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen on three types : &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt

&quot; before the end of the banana , the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&amp; gt ; there is a change of the icon for the band that the integration of the band was solved and shows in status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat , it must be used by &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp;
&quot; a tape must be form@@ atted , before you are used to save data . this process will not be form@@ atted , before you do not need to be form@@ atted , before you do not have to be form@@ atted . flo@@ ppy disk@@ s are usually used in form@@ atting of the banana holes , DA@@ T drives . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band named and the capacity is lost , with the form@@ atting of the banana . all data on the volume is lost ! after completion of the volume , the volume is automatically generated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you can follow the backup process , you must choose the saf@@ est files that can happen at three types : &quot;
select a file or folder in local file tree .
select a profile profile in the tree .
select files in local file tree with one ports . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click on the right mouse to select the local file tree and select in the menu ...
&quot; once the backup process was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings the dialog , the dialogue indicates the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or a folder in one of the link to the drive .
select the files in one of the products in the list for the band with a hem@@ isph@@ ere . it will only be checked the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click on the right mouse button in one of the Archive and select the menu entry .
&quot; as soon as the test procedure has been started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can select one of your choice and change the working folders for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog is the dialog . this dialog shows the progress of the examination and data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can recover the files , the files must be restored , marked on two types : &quot;
select a file or a folder in one of the products that belong to the tape . it is only the selected file or the sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the Archive with a ports .
click on the right mouse button or select a folder in one of the Archive and select it in the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process is started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check out your selection and working folders for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; to create paragra@@ phs , you simply leave blank lines . ) &quot;
&quot; this allows a backup profile with the straight files and default settings . you can make a backup profile of the following settings : &quot;
the current job folders in which the backup should be done . the list of the saf@@ est files will be updated according to the selected working folders .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , you can also use the same file system as the folder . &quot;
perform a ink@@ re@@ mental backup . to determine which files are changed since the last ink@@ mental backup file is used for the files that have changed since then changed since .
the name of the file that is used for determination of modifications since the last ink@@ ment is used .
this means that all files will be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup file .
&quot; the functionality of buttons &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented in the time of creating this documentation . &quot;
the settings can be done via the menu item at K@@ D@@ at ... in menu settings . the following settings can be used :
the complete path to the device ( normally / dev / day ) .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the volume is the command to the drive . at some drives , this is required to be carried out before reading or writing operations . &quot;
&quot; this option is activated , trying to switch &amp; k@@ dat ; the switch is switched off at the band . possibly this setting does not work with all band networks . &quot;
this option is activated at the soldering of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically do not use this option for flo@@ ppy disk@@ s .
&quot; the option enabled , trying to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the log @-@ size of the output file is not working properly . no all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to set up &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ age is set . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; gt ; a band @-@ form@@ atted , writes a file at the beginning of the banana . this file should only be a disk block on the band . the content of the file is as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n byte ) The volume of this string is the name : seconds , whereby the name of the full name of the system is to be passed onto the band . seconds , the number of seconds , which was passed since the time was passed since the time . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
other files on the band are pure tar -@@ Archive which is directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar should work directly with &amp; GNU .
check the content of a backup line . this symbol is only active when a band is applied .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ s@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; or viewer for system Log@@ s . the program is suitable for unwanted users , where you can get information about your system or where the system is the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ s@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is an easy @-@ to @-@ use of the protocol files of your own system . the program is for unwanted users , which can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system is the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users the fast access to information on problems that appear on their servers . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; try some advanced functions that can be switched on their server , using the protocol file specific programs and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include : &quot;
support for many different types of protocol files for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and the Samba
many other functions are also included in the other chapters .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with their help , the individual protocol line of a protocol file is easy to filter and can be displayed in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open it , and it opens up a small news window , so you can &apos;t have a small news window , so you can &apos;t find a small news window , so you can &apos;t find a small news window in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually do not have any use for reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar to filter the filter bar . the list of protocols will be displayed in the filter bar , so that only a protocol line is displayed in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; you can select a different entry in the protocol , then select the name of the filter folder , then select the name of a process that shows you in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines have been sent to this process automatically . &quot;
&quot; this option is activated in the default setting , and helps you to detect the important protocol lines with a distinctive colour as the protocol lines of the protocol line can be switched off . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you may want to investigate the process identification ( O ) in the column process . this can be useful for example , if you want to investigate the output of a specific command as for example to the start of the Samba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can select the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new posts of protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows for example of several minutes files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu to open additional lower window . once you selected a sub@@ window , choose the menu . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops the standard for controlling the program starts at high speeds of the system in the &amp; Linux , world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about yourself : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on system V In@@ it , without a new installation and new form@@ atting . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it distingu@@ ishes itself from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc . you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following other folders :
&quot; basically , you need a script for any system service , you want to start using a script for any system service which you want to start at high level of the system or when using a other Run@@ time@@ . , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Setup .NET ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; if you need to run a r@@ c.@@ zip on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ zip into / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run away with the serial connection . &quot;

&quot; if you want to change a look at the second column , you can edit the first column 3 . if you want to change , then you can repair it / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab from hand . if you want to change it , then you can repair the system to run the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; you can enter the right script by clicking &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; to the right of the &quot; &quot; Publish to FTP server &quot; &quot; drop down list . FTP Location Manager window will appear . &quot;
you will be able to notice that in this folder have no right files on this folder . instead of any entry here here is a link to one of the script in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
&quot; how do and stop@@ pt in@@ it actually , system services ? very simple : each of the script is so written , that it is a argument like start and stop . you can start by hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would be called the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains the script with the argument limit . if he is a S , the script is called with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people would like a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have a server -@@ Run@@ level , the only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; mail mail ; , network &amp; quot ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be difficult , because the program is so user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time device is easy to tell us tri@@ vi@@ al : take a entry in the range of the system services to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move up between Run@@ nin n and position the position within a Lev@@ els , by making it very different from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved , if you choose to copy it into a new area . in order to copy the Edit menu or select from the menu menu and in the target area -- even if the same entry is already in the target area of action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry may not be charged . in such a case , you do not need to add the Sor@@ cer@@ al numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore the condition that were thrown in the paper roll . be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the Tab@@ .pdf button to activate the different working areas ( max. system services , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor buttons to meet a selection or below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in order to move one entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the clipboard ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the user number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries are provided in the menu file . &quot;
default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard lap times and now starts the machine resistant . what can I do ? what can I do ?
enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in individual users mode . then select the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard cross level at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for version of Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you have to use additional files in / etc . &quot;
&quot; the type of how system services in these distri@@ butions , it makes it possible to provide the configuration for proprietary entry programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; planning a expansion of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check whether all configuration files are needed ( and also whether they are not present in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) can be just without message if your configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; if you use a different distribution , please send us more information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .

&quot; after your changes , you have to save it . either you use the corresponding symbol of the factory settings or the entry in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards cards , the user and the user group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog box or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some card cards will be displayed only if you need to be implemented in different settings . if you have enabled the limitations , a card card will appear on which you can easily change individual settings . &quot;
&quot; the card card is published , if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd file like in BSD router . &quot;
&quot; this card card appears only , if necessary for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ates and spec@@ ulation ( recogni@@ zable on the file rates a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can be modified for each user as the respective restrictions are in KB are : &quot;
this parameter can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by the field of the file system .
the card card will be informed about the group &apos;s groups of selected user . the default group that belongs to the user can be found in the primary field .
the dialog of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group select this user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or a group , select a user or group or click the appropriate add button of the factory settings . the Edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works . &quot;
&quot; using this module you can add the li@@ lo boat manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to the way of the standard operating system , remove , remove operating system , remove , change and more . &quot;
