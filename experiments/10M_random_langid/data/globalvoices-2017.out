&quot; although I had visited the US for 2012 at least once a year , I would like to live now for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally large .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors read from American authors and its sport . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this land had a der@@ ive effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as 14 years old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ let of a oil @-@ Mag@@ nat@@ al . &quot;
I was tra@@ pped .

&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA only . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I lived in which I lived in which I lived in which I have lived , and it &apos;s easy to work in a community of uniform people . &quot;
I even had a very beautiful love story about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and the rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the extraordinary aspect of his Ascension is for me , as he goes with his Eng@@ age . &quot;
Originaltitel : the X Files ( TV )
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colle@@ ague , and explains publicly of his condem@@ nation for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have re@@ acts on his statements and re@@ acts upon him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won at the national elections , was the highest number that had been made by the party of the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are Americans , who are the Americans , asked me ? &quot;
I was Tr@@ ump and his son not with the people in accordance with the people I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist Christoph , the people from all over the world , a deeply shaped man , with whom I could enter@@ tain me about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; , &quot; the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; , &quot; entered into the &quot; C@@ inc@@ in@@ nati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also a contrast to the gener@@ osity of gener@@ osity , which I am with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , which I am with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , which I am with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , my host family , who had been treated with her son . &quot;
&quot; it is also suitable for the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , which is always with a lot of patience and sharing my colleagues to know us to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Andrew Di@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , who helped me a lot of my career . &quot;
these people and the em@@ bark@@ ing of my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump was his way to meet the Day of the Year &apos;s Day , they gave me a stop and the counter@@ part to his own vision for his own vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8th of November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidential election of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its distribution towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; of course , the idea that people for Tr@@ ump have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were ready to over@@ throw his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ sm or because they were ready to over@@ throw them to me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is un@@ fair for Tr@@ ump &apos;s Tr@@ ump .
&quot; one of my friends , said one of my friends , is exactly what we have led to this situation . &quot;
this is upper@@ most and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and act .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be aware that this is a matter of which most white are looking for Tr@@ ump , because they want to win the control over a country that they dis@@ appointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in this America . &quot;

&quot; however , one can &apos;t forget the words of David Rem@@ i@@ vely forgotten that the cru@@ el decision was able to lay a man to lay a man who look down to those who look like . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. , D . : as much as &quot; according to all other eth@@ ni@@ es , the play of white in An@@ spiel@@ haus , which is as much means as Sch@@ loss@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it is a great Van Jones called exactly what America was so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people in the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may also like , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , how he says , nowhere else in the world is possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white American America &apos;s love and says : to hell with versatility , religious freedom and the whole term of the Pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man was once again on Ru@@ der , say . &quot;
&quot; with all that I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the Father of a soldiers who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the evening of the election . &quot;
&quot; on the left side of Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a voice change with the Son of Man . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , the son of Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd responded with a strong &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Muslims had a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; there was a lot of fun . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos one place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they said . &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices . &quot;
&quot; if somebody who don &apos;t know how you are , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a registered and strong &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; in the words of the words : &quot; &quot; God be thank@@ ful , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later , he was reported . &quot;
&quot; the land , for his son , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that is my heart .

the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the congregation , which is located in one of the most beautiful provinces in Mex@@ ik@@ os , is known for their drugs and the Ban@@ den @-@ violence . &quot;

&quot; so far as F@@ avi@@ o has shown something that he had never seen before , one made from waste . &quot;
today there is a whole orchestra that is based on instruments from re@@ trac@@ ing material and which is the Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .

these East African countries show how technology and team work for illegal fish@@ eries .

&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce was released at En@@ si@@ a.com , published in En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ published in the framework of a agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , this ship had already known that this ship has already started in li@@ ve@@ dic waters , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were therefore inc@@ ap@@ able , and a little bit inc@@ ap@@ ing to the law of these kind to their co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ment@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ sed against the ship . they refused to share one of their heads . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Prime Minister is surrounded by countries that you simply had everything required , &quot; rec@@ laim@@ s Ki@@ il@@ u , a conduc@@ tivity of the ken@@ i@@ ian fisher@@ men . it is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s boat , and pursued . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship then was distributed from the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch up there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to Pl@@ eit@@ ing the fish stock of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of these initiative , the criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale Travel Guide ) . &quot;
the members of this network is next to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had been exp@@ elled from their waters .
&quot; for this reason we have eight countries , who are uniform and work together . &quot; &quot; Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ acter Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is not regulated by definition : what is bound , is covered , because it is extremely difficult to do so because it is extremely difficult to do so , that &apos;s the illegal fish@@ eries is a main cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the estimated delivery of existing laws , through which certain living rooms and types are protected by the illegal fish@@ eries ecos@@ ystems , which have a del@@ ici@@ ally equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; however , during actions against the illegal fish@@ eries once by bureau@@ cratic ri@@ pen@@ ing , the information between individual countries in real @-@ time , the actions nowadays in real @-@ time , the actions nowadays in real @-@ time , with trace@@ able to the F@@ ISH &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the individual countries can be ex@@ ported from each other to the existing lic@@ ences or details that can be found during a harbour spectrum or experience . &quot;

&quot; this allows the authorities to mark the ships to mark the ships in different areas , such as such as such as a ship will take its frozen fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; in the ide@@ al@@ fall , such investigations can show whether the same ships have a fish fan@@ ati@@ ence , where they were on their way and possibly , whether they were a Stra@@ p . &quot;
&quot; what means that the ships can do not sell their cargo on the basis of such ships in their heads . what means that the ships can do not sell their charge , and that they can even be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced in the case of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , what means that the illegal fish@@ ness is not worth more . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; said Per Erik Ber@@ gh , conduc@@ tive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . &quot;

&quot; the so @-@ called platform was created to gain an increase of 20 million USD at lost sales , who lose eight members of the network on H@@ ire @-@ i each year , because of the illegal fisher@@ man , the eight members of the network in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; Ost@@ afrika has one of the most productive world fish@@ eries , on the region of commercial fish@@ eries from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; among these practices such as the sailing under the wrong flag , fake licensing rules , statement of fantasy , the fish of protected species and fishing in nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you use the missing international co @-@ operation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ secure control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; You will not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale gor@@ der is trying to close F@@ ISH . &quot;

&quot; the ships that covers all of the licenses in Tanzania . there have been covered ships that are not persec@@ uted , and found the ships and found the ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight terrorism , F@@ ISH can share information on illegal fish@@ eries over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far in the networks of organizational crimes &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ men use very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eive their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Dr. Cop@@ eland , Head analy@@ st in Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , a N@@ RO , who is also offering fishing data and F@@ ISH technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships do not turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be found from satell@@ ites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels .
a model program
&quot; so , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ war@@ k , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ war@@ ns has opened its platform with Google and the sea protection organization Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform Global Land Watch : a platform , which offers satellite data , and by which the position of each individual offer can be displayed in the world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance to get a better picture of it , who does it - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for the countries to unite and develop their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , it is necessary to use this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ach@@ Char@@ le@@ aks has a similar project to run by a glob@@ ales System , the persecution of ships and ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not just cri@@ tici@@ zed , but they also ab@@ stain it . &quot;
ships that formerly used without license recur@@ ves and hardly have consequences with consequences they know that they may be observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the members of F@@ ISH @-@ i participating countries have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since the fishing boats has more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after the first time , Gre@@ ko 1 were helped to play Gre@@ ko 1 up , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tractor , whose application is prohibited . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study of this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have been closed , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; With security is the goal , nor more such initiatives and structures even in other regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; first of all , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s younger member states agreed on his first major triumph : in October it is Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on wrong flag . &quot;
&quot; the boat was still in vain waters , which are for fisher@@ men from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the rest of the measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , the strong sign that they go against illegal fish@@ ness . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;

&quot; that means that the prisoners must be aboli@@ shed , &quot;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la in 1976 .
the first and last time he served me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to rise to me . he led me to a bar@@ rage , in the cars , furniture , television , cool@@ ness - just all possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little into a blanket in a ceiling , and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there is a large bowl of silver . &quot;
&quot; at that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ rage , where the stolen objects were taken , and stood up me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he prayed to an open space and said :
&quot; as a result , the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; I wires , and saw a light , on the man . &quot;
&quot; it looked like a field , and metal springs . &quot;
&quot; later , I found out that she was fast@@ ened to the end of an cab@@ le@@ way . the other end was fast@@ ened on the body of the person who went straight there . &quot;

&quot; years later , when my father was under house@@ wife , the same smell from his room . &quot;
I realized the odor immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible to do a man of another so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried out and ey@@ ed . &quot;
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses where naked people with the face to the bottom - all were on their hands and feet .
near the entrance door was silent on the mattress .
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said : &quot; &quot; what gu@@ do you like it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you tell me anything else ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were killed in a pit , and buried by soldiers . &quot;
I know that I told my father at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some spaces that were referred to as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know that &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man , and sle@@ pt . &quot;

&quot; if they were transferred to torture , the prisoners were thrown into the Cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the above came , that they should be moved . &quot;

&quot; in the Japanese city Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can rely on its leaders in the last month witnesses of a very special treat . &quot;

the incorrect translation was from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
the original photos of U2 Lev@@ ine was divided into social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian , a inhabitants of Ky@@ iv . it was also that the local company was atten@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; in Ky@@ oto , Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n wrote : &quot;
how could it come to this English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
&quot; this is a letter for older people , and in an international city such as Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable &quot; , &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; the order &quot; &quot; Sound Recorder &quot; &quot; was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; Sound Recorder &quot; &quot; was replaced by the reasonable , if it &apos;s not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Ky@@ oto turned to the translation errors . furthermore , she said that the error occurred in the text that they had been identified by the translator , and that the translation was not published before she was released . &quot;
a blogger was reported as follows :
&quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the word &quot; &quot; fear@@ less &quot; &quot; was used as un@@ reasonable description . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , the official version of the article has been published in the version of the article comments on the light that show the pre@@ aching parts of some Japanese songs for older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors will include the following comments :
&quot; - &quot; Is the &quot; &quot; fear@@ less drivers &quot; &quot; ? not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be reminded by SMS , if Pret@@ ty@@ Caroline is on @-@ line . &quot;

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are varied .
you need two important skills : passive language knowledge in order to understand the ext@@ inc@@ tion and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is in case of native language - it is generally valid for transl@@ ators in the target language - not in the starting language - native language .
&quot; the German language is English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , Italian , French

&quot; many Japanese companies have no staff members with English as a native language , translations in English as a native language . &quot;
&quot; a few companies that have no foreign employees do not have foreign employees . then the Japanese staff , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge as the best option will be made to transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are . &quot;

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; this applies to a few languages , which can be used for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange parts of English forms in Japan , including the Hebrew language , which often uses T @-@ shirts and pockets , are used only from styli@@ stic reasons - not to read or even understood . &quot;

&quot; translation errors may be un@@ acceptable or at least harm@@ less . however , by major corporations or from the government that have to guarantee higher standards , you can expect careful translations . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ o , who is known in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ an , is known as el Central - to Spanish sugar mill . &quot;
&quot; it is two years ago , as the activities in the sugar production plant was placed . &quot;
&quot; according to the proceeds the sugar producers in the region is silent , and the factory was lost after and after its plants , until only the weight of steel and concrete was left . &quot;
&quot; for about 272 workers had to be new . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he heard that it was in the east of the region of sugar production after long in@@ active time in operation because they have been preserved .
that was something which he was not expected .
&quot; N@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ o I would receive the sugar tubes , but the promises was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar@@ cane industry resistance , which is the case of socialism , the low market prices , the world &apos;s low management , the bad management team , and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production of 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 production quantity . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the land , but the bad Er@@ asmus are no re@@ warding . &quot;
why the Cub@@ an sugar@@ cane industry is switched off ?
the old railway station of the municipality saw better times .

&quot; the poll@@ ut@@ ants of sugar be@@ et industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar be@@ ks were technically , and hardly more competitive for the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production targets was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only produce the factories necessary to produce the sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
matching Problems in the Labour Market : between Skills Short@@ age and Over@@ education
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar levels and the condition of the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rises above about a decade . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production of the level of 2001 would continue ( 3,6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export of approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
everything went well

&quot; since then , the process of re@@ structured in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar production plants , more than 65 million people were received their full earnings for training . &quot;

&quot; from there on was the responsibility , and the letters came to be more often more common . &quot;

the most important industrial field of Cuba and the most important workplace was removed .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work and services that were found in the communities in which they found themselves . &quot;
&quot; we never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of the 21st of October 2002 , the dam@@ ning president in the eyes of the present persons , when he was guaranteed that for the areas of the factories , whose factories has been no more in operation , everything would run smoothly . &quot;

&quot; no , it is not normal to hear my 10 years of C@@ ous@@ in , that he wants to hear Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) . &quot;
&quot; for me it is that they would be lost and those who have lost someone , and those who have fear to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories about mere figures in a statistics .
&quot; the Tat@@ ars of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbour , that they were justified . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk about this tragedy , when they remain silent and silent . &quot;

&quot; there are two strong topics or frame pages ( ir@@ radiation ) that go to this title . the first frame focusing on religion . &quot;
the picture has been used in relation to bigger discussions about the silence of Christians through Muslims or - for defense of Muslims - the revival of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fra@@ ming to discuss the picture to discuss such an African life compared to a European or French life .
religion is to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth@@ while to investigate how to use it in connection with these efforts .
but what happens when reading this pictures do not last longer in faith .
&quot; with social media , there are people who are un@@ inten@@ tional to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the spread of the pure image has been published in detail ( here ) .
&quot; a argument is that the ref@@ usal of images of a woman comes to recognize the tragedy , to recognize these images even by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern that the violent image of readers and spect@@ ro@@ sc@@ opy and viewers the ability to take care of Emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which sought to work as violent media on the other ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are a lot of translations available in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news . &quot;
&quot; they are thoroughly investigated by algorithms to support the struggle against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will be thoroughly investigated in the situation in which an image has to be used , but can also be used by the context or to completely abuse of context . &quot;
&quot; however , there is no evidence that it does not exist . &quot;

&quot; since it is another group , the expon@@ ential growth is grown by making the &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet been given , but now the great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am wor@@ ried about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware that I was so old as I was my daughter , but who is now my daughter today . &quot;
things that I have here like a bread rolls on my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps memories of memories , because in all the inter@@ iors , our mankind will make a story of a history where someone is going to a &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; more than a hundred students talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American Mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
these are not the terms associated with which we usually read in our schools in order to read our newspapers .
- How is the market predicted to develop in the future ? - How is the market predicted to develop in the future ?
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I explain here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where did Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars , and people by the sound of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation . &quot;
&quot; we must tell us even un@@ comfortable questions in the role of its , consciously and un@@ aware that the &quot; other &quot; means that we have no president in which we could not have a new future , in which we could not have a new future in which we could not have a new future in which we could not have a new future , in which we could not have a new future in which we could not have a new future in which we could not have a new future in which we have already had a new future in which we have already had a new future in which we have already had a new future in which we had already had the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Ann , founder of the initiative Treasure Center ( T@@ LS ) is the creation of stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the year , Global Vo@@ ices told short about another initiative by Steven Bird , the in@@ numer@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not based on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is a attempt to get rid of the wide variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; actually in urban areas such as Melbourne , Dar@@ win in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS already has been done for 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages did not have to be considered for children . &quot;
project of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the world can be avoided if we will create cities , the di@@ ges@@ tive and secure spaces where inhabitants are not forget , who are not logged in to view it . &quot;
&quot; in order to listen to this events , you have to listen to these events , to feel at home to feel at home . &quot;
&quot; in this format you can imagine their history first in their own language , and explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants does not have professional power failure , their H@@ ing@@ ress , and their representation , that the audience will be able to enter it . &quot;
&quot; you call the mind and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language of Burkina Faso . during this lap , you will also explain the opportunity to explain the history of the history of the story . &quot;
&quot; in a different event , John Ny@@ mp@@ ara is the F@@ ont from the H@@ ases and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Sim@@ ons : &quot;
&quot; when he asked the meaning of his F@@ act , John Ny@@ mp@@ ara asked : &quot; how is it to speak to a audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he tells his feeling of inc@@ lined : &quot;
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were very close to me !

&quot; the book , which was published in the last year , and it is not available in the last year . it contains a number of resol@@ utions that are working with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it &apos;s a hom@@ mage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is : &quot;
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of free knowledge , have been involved in the movement for free knowledge . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and meadows of the internet , who has been killed in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was made from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
we have no information about his current state or stay .
&quot; the part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family , who want to know him with his free life , and who want to know him in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; how Bass@@ el has a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to think about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions . &quot;

&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military service , an un@@ familiar place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the scri@@ bed and anim@@ e@@ tin N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police chief on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly forbidden &quot; &quot; command command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;

&quot; his stay in the place , but still remain unknown . &quot;
a pre @-@ moder@@ ation of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , played Bass@@ el a decisive role in order to expand the access to the internet and knowledge about the society in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Lyn@@ n , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently over@@ ride the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , the Bass@@ el writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was none of Bash@@ ar cultural prot@@ otypes as the work , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 around the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , the immobili@@ ser of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and the Greek architectural types of surrounding traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started with this work , the IS was able to put this architecture that not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world of the world . &quot;
this string is created in the digital archae@@ ology and the preservation of the time for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ adequate value .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el was unable to close this project so far . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also has contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;

&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country &apos;s country have decided that this practice is to offer this practice , so that the question is now in 18 . &quot;

&quot; since more than one month , Turkey &apos;s popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based En@@ zyk@@ lop@@ ädie on Wikipedia . &quot;
the day for the day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .

&quot; although many laboratories have been used , forming tools for non @-@ related websites ( a current article published by New York Times reported that Turkey is the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia @-@ users cannot be found in this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been moved from Wikipedia , as recently in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University in 2007 , regular block@@ ades of the Intern@@ als since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country of the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to continue , there are several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform of all Turkish Wikipedia pages on whose de@@ centr@@ alised , Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( so computer @-@ computer connections ) , which is not difficult for the system of domain names and thus is a complete cens@@ orship . &quot;

in a Blog@@ post &gt; IP@@ FS about his efforts :
&quot; once we have heard the news ( about the loading of Wikipedia ) , we put all that sn@@ ap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . this is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help the users to see at least all the Wikipedia content , even if they can not reach the website www.@@ google@@ .com. &quot;
IP@@ FS also announced that this step is done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it &apos;s only for screen@@ shots or dynamic versions of the website .

&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photograph@@ ers ! ! &quot;

the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist destination of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; a few minutes later , I saw my camera with my camera and was just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; my father had observed him , and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leop@@ ard was broken . &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar develops a collaboration with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ li@@ as Nature and wants to improve the understanding of wild animals , as they look like . &quot;
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood at the face of face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t break away from the opinion of the sheep not to sleep in sleep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; and I was because of the darkness on the path , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ster &apos;s house . he sets himself immediately , and let us see him by the S@@ al @-@ tree ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , placed Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
his passion for promoting Nept@@ une in nature and wild is not always easy .
&quot; he wa@@ ited for 22 days , and lived in a tent to make up in the Bar@@ dia National Park , until he took a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist attractions . &quot;

&quot; instead , they don &apos;t use a Pr@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women say that they should be respect to the social pressure the husband , as well as fear of the consequences . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ oo@@ a by a head@@ band condem@@ ns and from her family and the village community , after they had a close relationship with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives did not call to name , is also common among men , even among men . however , they have far less fear@@ ful , if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and H@@ ats , a unique part of the city and were so fast to the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss the enemies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , which is operated by the community of the Patri@@ arch@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; raw materials has been working for seven years with help of their video camera on the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s home , as children from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS , and led this Klu@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; they reported how these clubs have a safe place for these women , and they have been created at the same time at the time of the wall of the wall . &quot;
&quot; the first video that showed the cru@@ el@@ ty in their discussion , was the name of women who do not call their hus@@ bands . &quot;
it has decided for this issue because they wanted to identify the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify women .
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands are not according to the interests of their hus@@ bands , and they never have to be taken into question . &quot;

the tradition is so deep rooted in this discussion we have never thought about this discussion .

&quot; many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it is a good thing , because it meant that the recent members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the lap , cru@@ ini was a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video project , the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; cru@@ el@@ ers asked each participant in the name of their husband with different feelings , happy , angry , lov@@ ingly , and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal to ?
&quot; some of these women have been married and this was the first day that they brought the name of their hus@@ bands in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra by the Bre@@ wery in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra . &quot;

&quot; the husband of a woman called cru@@ el@@ ty and asked what ideas they sat in the head , and his wife could not stop his name to say his name . &quot;
another Klu@@ b@@ age decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .

why not only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the cin@@ em@@ ary red point , if he would also do it . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and heard him to wear him .
&quot; the other women have not completely changed , but my , they were now in a better position , even to choose it in some days . &quot;

in a discussion we have to enter@@ tain us about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have been carried out in the group since their marriage only Sar@@ is .
&quot; for most of it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to have a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a trousers , wear them . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of war and discussion about the benefits of your own clos@@ et , mor@@ als with the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery made with the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery made her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ trau@@ n ) in a discussion round , so the women were able to carry them . &quot;

&quot; in the five months since their first discussion club , you have changed into the five months since the first discussion club has confirmed how the things come slowly into rolls : &quot;
&quot; so far , only little steps are made . &quot;
&quot; some women tried a few times , but they heard again to say the names of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; some , me , make it still , but only if they are alone , and no other family members are . &quot;
only one or two women continue to the names of their hus@@ bands . only one or two women carry now at any time of Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on her foreh@@ ead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want in their lives - like the fo@@ aming up more freedom of movement or the own form of movement - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
&quot; by using another self confidence , they will be aware that they sit in the same boat . &quot;
how raw is explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .

is Singapore a city or land ?
&quot; the question may not appear in the international level as an independent state , as independent state . &quot;
&quot; however , when there is no reason for this reason , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; this note , in the Blog@@ osphere . &quot;
&quot; during the meeting on a meeting of the International Monetary Union of the State of New York , the Minister said that many people the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore knows , because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;

... no one has to question whether New York has a democracy ...
that &apos;s why most people have a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we could be different .
we are a city .
we are not the country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused itself to defend the logic of the logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and assi@@ stants to create this valuable country , you have to say that we will not be in the country . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , volcanic erup@@ ted , there had been the face of a escape before the rebel@@ lion . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my land , eat , it is then ? &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he lived up an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore is unable to measure the political system from Singapore . &quot;
&quot; he has to def@@ ended the idea that Singapore with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities which are permanently led to a party . &quot;
these cities are very different .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the theme , the good old per@@ er of the author@@ itarian rulers have to be asked to leave the same logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;

&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , he said , why the elections in Singapore are important for us , even if we are free and fair elections . &quot;
he spent in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is no land , he has obviously not obvious in this sense ! &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ mug@@ gling is a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when Singapore is no land , we will only viewed as an independent and sovereign State ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go to the sovereign , the sovereign rights of the city Singapore back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and town . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mug@@ gling is a serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why the people are more expensive to their military service , but not their city , but not their country ? &quot;

nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often do often statements like &quot; the defence of the country , above all , but this is not entirely correct . &quot;
we should speak of the defence of the city .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it hasn &apos;t done something with pil@@ low . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly work and everyone was right . &quot;
&quot; I remember every day , like the city and the war . &quot;
&quot; when our conversation at the end , a small boy is over us . &quot;
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another young dog .

&quot; on the way of mig@@ rant workers , Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very easy hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - and a small woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als with a cor@@ als and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in ro@@ dy@@ bear shape . &quot;
&quot; they called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians have become a goal for Afri@@ cans .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 Dollar the night sleep rooms sleep in simple rooms , with k@@ etch@@ up , walls , walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no way to hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ ves Mig@@ rants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez has come to call the people in full @-@ bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; where are you M@@ om ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there is only 24 rooms in some rooms .
&quot; I would like to be reminded by SMS , if Pret@@ ty@@ Caroline is on @-@ line
&quot; they also helps them , and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they make them medicines that they do not pay them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally composed of Angola , is before a short time . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ UST Africa is a reasonable Spitz@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ger ) posing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; yes , yes , he replied with a smile . &quot; I feel that it fits well as African women are very nice women . &quot;
lov@@ ingly lov@@ ingly .
she has the heart of a mother ...
we feel very happy .
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister to get back to Boston to get their husband and the three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , however , it is a few Afri@@ cans that are on the way into the United States , normal to take a first stop in South America and then towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had a known name on the track , &quot; &quot; Paul Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often find the route , and that the Afri@@ cans can speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of its immobili@@ ser , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and has worked as a construction workers at the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has begun his journey into the United States . &quot;

Ram@@ ad@@ rez told that their guests are often to send text messages when they went to gr@@ ind or to report them over the course of their journey .
they explained that their Christian faith of the drive of their work is .
&quot; she knows not much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken , as in Ghana . &quot;
Ram@@ ad@@ rez is perhaps very well known but it is not the only radio &apos;s hope for Mig@@ rants that travels through Tap@@ estry .
&quot; on the other end of the city , a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ci@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ ci@@ ela and his family mig@@ rant were recorded in their little house . &quot;
he is Political and has found that the bus tickets to a lot of African mig@@ rant workers are sold .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , and he has offered them his house for a dollar . &quot;
&quot; in the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ ci@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , he told him . &quot; I &apos;ve experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there is places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the majority of the mig@@ rant who travels through Tap@@ estry , from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ respon@@ der Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who fled from him to have a plan without a plan .
&quot; in tap@@ ach@@ ites , he has been asked to a group of ac@@ comodation , and a well @-@ known , a well @-@ known , has her roof for him . &quot;
&quot; some months later , the family lives still , and she tries to decide where the next steps go . &quot;
back in the House of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
enter multiple addresses separated by comm@@ as and / or different lines .
a small bus now arrived and has brought 20 new guests to the majority of Somalia .
Ram@@ ad@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full but it is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
&quot; like a proud grand@@ mother , she put her in her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair , who made her a Kun@@ din , some pictures of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , young and old . &quot;

&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but not that I &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; how the boss of the Security Council is form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time will be a pleasure . &quot;
he set his power over us by making even the simpl@@ est concepts destroyed .
five teen@@ agers were torn during a peaceful prot@@ ector like in@@ k@@ eling from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; so far away from that the city is the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know what to do with it , but I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , reg@@ ain , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands on a city that is in the arter@@ ies with state security and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a calm situation after having heard the power supply in the quarter . &quot;
&quot; I removed the silence , by doing several times &quot; &quot; hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice through silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends have mu@@ dd@@ led enough to leave together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends , and gave me to a pra@@ ying image that my expectations are full and completely filled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you are the spirit from the lamp , but it is not just not in the smell . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet us with the military security buildings . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you hin@@ der - nothing can give your voice , after you have the whole way to the office of the safety service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood with several of his men , my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak , &quot; &quot; let me hear how you are &apos; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only to cry enough if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ edge filled eyes open me .
&quot; and you don &apos;t know what to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
&quot; what I did , did nothing to do with courage . &quot;
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my tor@@ ment , E@@ it@@ el@@ ess , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , as I answered , &quot; I would not know that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never heard you in the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; it was the short@@ est conversation that had such fat@@ ale consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I said . &quot;

the following article is the published version of the contribution &quot; Love &apos;s Message to Guer@@ il@@ la@@ ghan &quot; which has published the international online magazine tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; it is not much more important , people who feel right to bring upon the land ? &quot;
&quot; this question went on to the two young kol@@ um@@ bi@@ ans , Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga by the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation . &quot;
&quot; after short , their land began in a historic event and wanted to contribute to their part , after years of long negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had a peace agreement with the Guer@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ ood FAR@@ C ( German : revolutionary forces of Kolum@@ ba ) , which forms the first point of the longest @-@ armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
International was the signat@@ ory of the peace of peace as an important that the kol@@ um@@ bi@@ ographical President José Manuel San@@ tos for his services to the Peace Prize .
&quot; however , there is a long way to talk about reconciliation and peace . &quot;
guer@@ illa Growing 2007
&quot; the kol@@ um@@ bi@@ blical society will turn to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards the Guer@@ il@@ la@@ sie , it has to support them in their ranks and it has to support the building of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young men have to close together and help the integration process .
&quot; and exactly the did they say : until now , thousands of young people are written in a former guer@@ ri@@ lla town in order to welcome them again in society . &quot;
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation were created on the World Cup of Peace in Bog@@ ot@@ á , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á , which was awarded with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ ch@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the Peace Prize for Peace . &quot;
&quot; this said , that we love the people that we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day of love letters , but those who forget that they need lots of luck . &quot;
he told him to share his love with man who created his love with man who could be the most urgent need .
&quot; as a result , the plan , letters of hope and support for former fighters from the FAR@@ C to write their place in society and to make a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the Dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the campaign more than 2000 letters , the campaign has been collected more than 2000 letters . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all larger cities like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I would never thought that someone would be for@@ given me .
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN stock in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art in the camp to bring the letters to the letters . &quot;
members of the FAR@@ C took place as they had done before they had done the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time , they received no orders , but letters of sub@@ contracting of people from the whole country . &quot;
&quot; a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it &apos;s incredible , how many different feelings are in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between - from fear to happiness and everything in between . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a team of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighters brought me through the camp of guer@@ illa @-@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; as I was in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind hut in which the Guer@@ il@@ la@@ sie live ) , I saw a Guer@@ il@@ la@@ under@@ er who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , for next to the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ oid , a deadly weapon in the quar@@ ter@@ med . &quot;
&quot; I answered him , and asked : &quot; &quot; what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t answer any letter to me somebody else . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
&quot; I &apos;ve never been in my life , I had something so nice to me . and then I saw the tears of tears on the w@@ angen . &quot;
&quot; I saw him very strong , and put me out beside the gran@@ at@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; maybe he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to write all the years of tre@@ ach@@ ment , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he had never been able to preserve him and his six brothers before the fam@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I would never thought that someone would be for@@ given me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a society that is waiting for us to be waiting for us .
&quot; by the way , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Members
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C went to a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were raised up as already war , and the FAR@@ C already had already seen in the bor@@ row . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the FAR@@ C the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als and gave their insight into their views over the peace of peace . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this order , it is worth@@ while to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people have heard that they had never been found and no electoral law , and to recognize that people who are often seen as Monster , and even learned that people are turned by their lives and their environment , were very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the land lives lives . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and put a lot of damage to you , and a smile and a smile . &quot;
many former fighters tried to reply to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z , the command of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the articles of this article will be published in English , French , German , English , French , German , English , French , Italian , French , Italian and French . &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , it will always give people who are ready to interv@@ ene and to cover their rights , and that &apos;s also justified ( ... ) . &quot;
we from the FAR@@ C put up on the peace of peace without weapons .
&quot; therefore , we call all defence of peace on - no matter what is breed , religion or ideology they belong to all those who dream of a land within the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , contribute our contribution , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . &quot;
&quot; on our way we will give many obstacles , but we will overcome them . &quot;

I spoke with someone who has a half @-@ half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an had taken no man and tor@@ tured , but that all the end of the Ram@@ ad@@ an is hardly ab@@ sent , and he concluded a new wave not . &quot;
&quot; most probably , they will concentrate on family and relatives . &quot;
&quot; so my mind , it was probably the transformation of the family , and that the problem with the affected person and at the end have a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; by blood . &quot;

&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or relatives have been left to set the Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , you will be able to see them so that they will be able to present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : they should be brought to their bodies in the television , and claim their bodies in the television and claim they would have been attacked by a military base . &quot;
understand that ?
&quot; in fact , these people do not simply disappeared but rather than the radical movement . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ing or have a source for this information ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : I don &apos;t think about someone who had a half months in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; he says that many people in this prison was gone , after their B@@ art was grown . &quot;
there was nothing new from them .
they have just taken them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was to be taken as this man . &quot;
&quot; however , they were not presented as Ban@@ di@@ als , there were not yet reports . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
what else would you have to do that people do not allowed to use it ?
&quot; do you know whether these persec@@ utions and performances of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already mentioned in the past ? &quot;

&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest companies in Iran on Iran and gas fields , as well as some of the most most important areas for ir@@ onic agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resource , the regional economy remains only slowly and the local population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and emp@@ tying . &quot;

&quot; why I do not speak with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ rup@@ tion@@ als . &quot;

&quot; the following article is a published version of the statement , which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ani@@ las@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was a subject of several discussions where many different positions came to expression . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; if I say that I am not femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who itself itself as inter@@ rup@@ tive femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they did not know why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; you will even become a scientific and social arguments against me , why I should be femin@@ ist , and why we are all femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , women today may still earn money more money than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to their bodies .
violence against women have a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards still make sure that women are earlier or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling and that discrimination due to the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is consciously aware and known .
I am convinced and I will be able to double and triple triple among them .
I &apos;m a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I have to talk to the skin color on the black C@@ is @-@ women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q city or on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q city or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a . &quot;
&quot; however , however , all that women - all women and women should come to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexual violence , an institutional form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which are exposed to black women on two times . &quot;
&quot; or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ic and Her@@ bal leaders less than white men and women . &quot;
that black girl and girls with Mig@@ ration@@ sh@@ ment more often to the school than white girls .
&quot; women in black sp@@ ells and women with a higher risk are exposed to poor violence and violence in partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men and all men , neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can take the same rights as a black woman , in whose center the white woman is to take into account both on the gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am not overwhel@@ med , and I will not get my refuge in a white femin@@ ist @-@ oriented Sp@@ h@@ ous , who always has always been working for me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in their speech , &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; I am not afraid to receive a ideology , in which the black woman in the historical context is an un@@ acceptable and mar@@ vell@@ ous nature . &quot;
&quot; I wei@@ gh me to close me , which also absor@@ b me through cultural attraction of our sitting and gro@@ ves to drive her ego@@ istic program . &quot;
&quot; for some of them , the importance of black women are trying to get the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to break up one thing . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ ruption of femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different flock of women , and the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I know it before me , and all of the femin@@ ism , the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as wife &apos;s life , rather than me for a white femin@@ ist paradig@@ m , which is so hard to do for a white femin@@ ist as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas , and let us go into the sp@@ ears , which will be created for us . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana Grande : how we can define ourselves in which they are completely safe , and not only the - black women can be able to define ourselves in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be made so that the black woman is so successful . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ ruption of femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ ati@@ sm and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please send them about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement . &quot;
&quot; in an Indian environment , I can sit black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m as part of this paradig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment , in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored . &quot;

&quot; to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women , is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if women need to display at once , they will have no support in general . &quot;
&quot; in many cases the women also depends on the women that they do not have to admit that it is not only 20 % of all women who need to be victims of violence against the prosecution . &quot;

&quot; it is hard to determine how many women really is growing , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ le@@ z , research scientist for Gen@@ der@@ ask in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , however , the numbers are based on the following figures . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Attor@@ ney General of the Federal Republic of Justice ( 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . at 70 % of it went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to the domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of the ads of women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women , that they were physically present , 55 % of women said of psychological distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
this statistics will not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the information of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ale Women &apos;s Cancer and Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these events , in Paraguay , in Paraguay because of psychological distur@@ ban@@ ces in Paraguay , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman who do not need to be ref@@ und@@ able because of the physical failure , two women who do not do this , she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of women in Paraguay , women &apos;s suicide is not adequate , as many women are murdered , as many women are murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , journalists arrived at least 12 cases of women in the country . &quot;
&quot; the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay , at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;

invisible creation and a legal system that is nothing ;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he was aware that they called him the name of all of their former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she wanted to do that , then , but after this , it should be for ever . &quot;
&quot; it is Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but two years later , she was the psych@@ ic violence against women and at the same time the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time . &quot;
I would never thought that I would be to be victims of mis@@ understanding .
&quot; if I have read about it , I thought that the only women happened to under@@ mine , because they have been made of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana has used social media to report about the mission by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , I wrote on Facebook , on Facebook , where they received his reward and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how it was isolated . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked , he asked whether he had ever made the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behaviour is also a form of failure . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why it had been so long by Carlos , and he had not made him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mis@@ ses at least a certain party .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not made in Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has been murdered . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network with cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women , that are all in any way victims of mission@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences and listen each other to each other . &quot;
they do that what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .

how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
&quot; RW , there are no basic research . &quot;
&quot; this must be change , otherwise we will remain unchanged instead of ourselves instead of themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;

is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are different .
&quot; it is difficult to find people that come back or go ahead , because the financing and the development potential are better than in other countries . &quot;

what are the obstacles you have in your routine research work which you did not had before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure corresponds to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply with electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .

&quot; RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how large is your opinion to the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is astonishing .
I have seen great students of all age .
&quot; there are demand for special scientific training , starting from every age . &quot;

&quot; for almost 20 years old , Mort@@ ons work is only through its own uniqu@@ eness , and the question how many sal@@ at@@ eth can get borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000@@ er , he saw that more sal@@ ate has been patented and that he could not be able to use it . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years , patents are becoming more and more plants , such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trends , environmental tests , environmental tests and materials for food safety around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ ennium of thousands of old tradition , however , he needs to be more restrictions since his work is still more restrictions . &quot;
it is that I would have to go in a river in a river in a river around which I have to do .
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents on sal@@ ate is too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they hold before judgment , no one can read more a new Sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te , because all features have been patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to use very careful and endeav@@ our to use material as well as intellectual property . &quot;

&quot; this means that it is not possible that they can buy seeds with their seed , and we can buy seeds at once . &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; will only allow you to buy seeds at their own varieties , and it is not immediately sufficient - two aspects that are forbidden through many plants . &quot;

&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has been busy with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such items are still not yet yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that m@@ illed plants such as wheat as wheat or car@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
a question of visibility
&quot; plants are so best suited to their taste or to improve their taste or to such , due to their taste or their colour to such , because they flour@@ ish in certain environments , and threats like p@@ ests and diseases such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of Pat@@ ras on plant properties indicate that the available crop material is currently more than ever before , since the changing conditions are much worse than ever before the changing conditions through climate change are much worse . &quot;
&quot; in a E @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aks Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto , that genetic diversity is important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ ity activities . &quot;
&quot; it is the view that it is the property of other bre@@ eders , since the patents and the protection of crop variations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can follow each one once the patent had expi@@ red . &quot;
often you can help these instructions with another method for the same result .
&quot; such innovations are not protected against innovations , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; but that doesn &apos;t work anymore , but they don &apos;t know what they are doing . &quot;
&quot; as long as long as long as long as long as long as , plants can be adapted to plants that would have lost the struggle for the struggle . &quot;
&quot; but it is not difficult to understand that genetic resources should always have been a general condition , and it also remains : &quot; independent plant species have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ous incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
&quot; we want to facilitate farmers , their work easier . &quot;
&quot; that is what we ant@@ ee , and it will be impossible to use us if we do not continue the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; together , the purpose of which mut@@ ation is not yet available , which can be used to produce molecules : &quot; we are creating the features not really themselves . &quot;
the plants they form themselves and as a bre@@ eder we have no idea how the plants are doing .
a mystery of nature .
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant enz@@ aids in the United States of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i Board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who have a sor@@ row@@ er ? &quot;
&quot; who are interested in industrial agriculture with great courtesy and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , who are required for their cultivation of her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , who lives in its varieties of agriculture in its varieties . &quot;

&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move to international markets , but smaller than a Mon@@ san@@ to are patents , even without patents - either rests or they hold it for expensive and therefore not lo@@ op@@ ed or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; yet it is also the view that bre@@ eders are innovative , &quot; &quot; it looks like , as I will produce my efforts to produce new , more effective than companies , the patented . &quot;
&quot; I need a lot of new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent it is 20 years ago , so that it is not so easy for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the US has to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; concept . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , itself as professional organisation in the area of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program , which works in the area of farmers and helps them to produce new varieties that meet specific needs . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them , &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own own own . &quot;

such practice indicates the intention of the government to block the content and filters to the Egyptian users may have access to the Egyptian user .
&quot; in addition , the situation becomes even worse , that the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ gency is made behind closed doors , allowing the Egyptian people have no legal basis , which can be considered against them against these actions . &quot;
now the question : how far is the Egyptian government prepared with cens@@ orship ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in the war ?
