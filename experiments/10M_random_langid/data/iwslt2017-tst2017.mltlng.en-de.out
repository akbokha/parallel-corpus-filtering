but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this context , he describes a dis@@ astro@@ phic U.S. intelligence agency , in which the CIA is literally resur@@ rec@@ ted for a nuclear weapon . &quot;
&quot; if it sounds simple , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible history .
but do you know that the chapter does not mean ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been able to call against Ris@@ en and asked him to call its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became the symbol for the pattern of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , condemned and journalists . &quot;
constitutional Complaints Against Re@@ ti@@ rement Income Act Un@@ successful
but it is impossible to use this right if the media does not get this information and if they don &apos;t protect them if they don &apos;t protect them .
&quot; so when the government with Ris@@ en ank@@ ed , he did something that he did , and he said , &quot; he refused , &quot; he said that he would prefer to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en comes with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; it is suddenly , although they would be un@@ successful for their case , the demands of the government were left to Ris@@ en . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the Reporter and sources are still less enthusiastic . &quot;
&quot; instead of to fail and Ris@@ en to bring it to the statements , that will also be able to do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , the investig@@ ator , without his agreement , his teleph@@ ony are concerned , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even Rei@@ mbur@@ sement with the list of its flights . &quot;

&quot; now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government can be too much of their work as a consultant . &quot;
&quot; since 11 September , almost every article about national security , the result that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalists . &quot;
we put the press work on the game that will be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has ever more possibilities to exp@@ ose all the problems .
&quot; however , as technology of the government allows the rights of rep@@ lication , the press can use technologies to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and at the moment , they can record them from the moment , in which they were contact , instead of moving . &quot;
&quot; there are communication software , which still have not been written as a Ris@@ en &apos;s book , and it &apos;s much safer than normal E @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , a open @-@ source transition system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by us and Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been developed . &quot;
&quot; instead of using a e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
you can download documents or send information in any case as in any case of any case .
&quot; this will be encryp@@ ted and on a server , which has access to the respective news agency . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the government cannot change more information , and many of the information that it would not be available from pre@@ order . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , to protect the press freedom of the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments are always looking forward to the whole world still new sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ et@@ technologies , which are all endanger@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is an opportunity to ensure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to protect the day . it is as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , one of those who want to be able to take care of the people who want to be able to take care of them . or the next environmental education , the alarm to dis@@ solve the water from F@@ lin@@ t . or the next environmental impact on the next financial crisis has been war@@ med up in the next crisis . &quot;
&quot; at least , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;

she was late . I was tired .

&quot; then there was Friday in the week of the day , to be gathered through the Muslims . &quot;
&quot; and again , the warnings of warnings are not at this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I saw the extensive reporting . &quot;
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ able , and I heard of the print on Muslims , or by people who made it for Muslims . &quot;
there was really fire an@@ uts on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .

it is not easy to explain itself to itself .
&quot; I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the bonds that are hard .
&quot; today we can say people say : &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims . &quot;
when will we do it ?
some people want to speak Muslims and mos@@ ques .
speak of my congregation as by a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is just the question : are we b@@ Ã¶s@@ se or ben@@ evol@@ ent ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our .
the alternatives are essential because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a lifel@@ ong organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are the invent@@ or and teacher , Er@@ asmus und Olympic Games . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques of America safe ?
&quot; it will perhaps stop some parking lots , but not the terror . &quot;
&quot; regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to be toler@@ ated to people other belief , and to show larger organizations . &quot;
&quot; he told me one of the police in the area of Washington , DC , told : people are actually not in mos@@ een . &quot;
they will be in their cellar or in bed before a computer radical .
&quot; when the radi@@ al process has been discovered , he has been discovered that he is a member of her community , even by her family , that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the person believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who understand their behaviour and their ideology , is a proph@@ ecy or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radi@@ otherapy , we must keep the people to go to mos@@ que . &quot;
some will always claim that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group as the IS has its gross power with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as the Muslims min , as a mother , I think that we must do everything to stop one group such as the IS . &quot;
but we would recognize us in their presence when you acknow@@ ledge it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !

both groups claim their ideology to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if you are a look at them , they don &apos;t know what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their lives that they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
&quot; a great Imam was told me recently , an amazing story : &quot;
&quot; a girl came to him , because they would have been to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him whether she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every means that they had spoken by them , she brought them to silence , and said to her that ye may bring her sense to the un@@ righteousness in the world , but only in trouble . &quot;
&quot; from nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization through Extre@@ mi@@ sts that you have a solution . &quot;
&quot; this Imam gave the connection to God , and their church again . &quot;
&quot; instead of them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real time in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the Mos@@ que , she asked them to join the IS . &quot;
&quot; this was a glimp@@ se , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia I and my family . &quot;
but how does it work on normal American ?
what does it mean to each other from any other ?
how does the 24 hours daily consumption of fear every day on our democracy , on our thought @-@ freedom ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually , several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , happen at least three things . &quot;
we do not accept a authorized government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you have reported test results in which neg@@ atives have reported to be military aid to Muslim countries , as well as the circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an acute problem .
&quot; when you look , when the mood against Muslims , between 2001 and 2013 -- this three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Ira@@ k@@ ete@@ enth and during two political periods .
&quot; on the contrary , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it may actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to expand the foundations of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the word of Muslims is an early warning signs . &quot;
&quot; we are perhaps more than the first , but the toxic air of fear is acc@@ ustom@@ ed to us . &quot;
&quot; in the condition of the collection of collective , it is not only about that even to explain itself . &quot;

&quot; during our research , we often ask the basic abstract issues that penet@@ rate to the core of the matter . &quot;
such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to do the answer to such question .
helic@@ opter are known about the machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts which is in order to harm you .
&quot; prior to decades ago the drivers were remote controlled air equipment , which had only two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern view . &quot;

what do you do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that it is only balanced .
&quot; for this reason , it is more ambitious in its orientation . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he receives the annual capability , &quot;

&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propylene . &quot;

the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time field itself and the universe explosion in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; at the time of the time , we were first at first time . &quot;
&quot; before 1.3 billion years ago , the life of the earth was born on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has a lot around : coral , fish , plants , Saul , people and -- God of us at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , I decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from C@@ alt@@ ech , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot;
Quelle : the Hollywood Reporter
&quot; however , enough people consider her as dis@@ appo@@ inting gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation created their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of decades development , construction , conception and extremely much har@@ dening work done the detector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational waves @-@ Ob@@ serv@@ atorium . &quot;
&quot; in the following days , the precision of LI@@ GO could significantly reduce the precision performance . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it is called advanced LI@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started for a last test run around some smaller , hard @-@ ready problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only some days after commission@@ ing of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of both col@@ li@@ di@@ ke black holes through the Earth . &quot;
they went through and me

&quot; the problem is that the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even anno@@ ying . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us is exposed to the waves of the waves and the stretching of a average man was 10 high @-@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means that 20 energy saved after comm@@ ma , followed by a 1st , the LI@@ GO staff was crazy . &quot;

I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us around : facial cover , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy . for so you can produce a picture or a map of things , by using multiple point of the light around you . &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you have to be registered and logged in to view the full @-@ length program .
&quot; therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things , which are particularly useful to you : &quot;

&quot; instead , we went to certain characteristics like sound and sound , rhythm and volume to close to the history . &quot;

the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t give you any simple pictures of objects at all .
but by using the changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves we can listen to us .
at least for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ tory area .
&quot; if we convert wav@@ el@@ ength in Sch@@ all , we can speak the All bookings . &quot;

it is a kind of motion det@@ erg@@ ent in the wave shape .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date which knows at least I will never forget to hear this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black smoke with each 30 @-@ f@@ ps solar mass which is about as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : don &apos;t think what &apos;s means .
&quot; two black holes , the di@@ ous body in all , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , four hundred times per second , before it kol@@ li@@ mus . &quot;

fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard .
the remaining meaning of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO has a completely new way to study the Al@@ ls , as they never before . &quot;
&quot; on this way , we can listen to all those who listen to the invisible and invisible . &quot;
much in all we can see -- practical or basically -- not .
&quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explosive . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about that .
&quot; the exciting physical processes , however , in the core that is behind bars of iron , carbon and Sili@@ zi@@ um is hidden behind . &quot;
we never go to see since these op@@ a@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of iron , as it would be clear glass . &quot;
&quot; by gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back up until the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic about all things that we have never seen , that we never see and of which we have never seen . things that we can only see by doing . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO is equal to the first intake of things which we were not expected . &quot;
&quot; my colleagues at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : Me : the Art of stars , the black holes , the Din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from pre@@ historic times . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO allows us a completely different view to the events in all , on the origins of the stars and ultimately , how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be so mu@@ ddy as only possible .
&quot; thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to create a great detector , and the space of the universe . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ edness -- a completely new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ology on Earth and all .

&quot; I made the same things like : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , through pre@@ aching , no Reu@@ ben , not a titanium , there is not a titanium , clear eyes , what also always . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
I was silence .

&quot; what makes you doing , what is doing what is doing , who loves what one loves , suddenly ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; heu@@ l thee out of the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , one works , one loves what you do , a mother to be a mother , a painter , a painter , a painter , a painter , a mother to be a painter , and knows how to stop the Sum@@ men I know , who is it ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
threads of the last 24 hours
&quot; when the song is my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then me , my &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; was a question . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m on the way to outside , late and she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I want to say that two things are aware of this :
&quot; first , I must say Yes to say and secondly , they called me not . &quot;
&quot; they called &quot; &quot; estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happens ?
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I am Titan , and my sum@@ mer@@ cies , and it changes everything before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters , we laugh@@ ed a lot and I read more dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it &apos;s outstanding , because my pain and my pan@@ ics , in the end , and in the lack of a sum@@ mer@@ ry , I can &apos;t make anything except to stop . &quot;
I am focused on .

I can &apos;t believe that I can &apos;t believe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
to have something in me .
a mental door goes on and a energy source comes to .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens , it happens . &quot;

&quot; no full volume , hardly because it is quiet , hardly visible , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
not the sum@@ s but a total .
&quot; and now I feel , as I would know a magical mystery . &quot;
but let us stay at the matter .
it &apos;s love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something that we have forgotten .

it &apos;s just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child will play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;

&quot; for this reason , you must be removed a part of the brain mixture . &quot;
&quot; instead of the free brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist who analyse the brain mass . &quot;
February 2013 7@@ 08 January 2013 846
we wanted cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
cells from a tissue curve is comparable to the small children who are taken out of your families .
&quot; you must find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to flour@@ ish . &quot;
exactly that we had to make these cells with these cells .
&quot; after many facets , Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois . &quot;
he saw under his micro@@ sk@@ op .
that was for us a great surprise .
why ?
&quot; it saw exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you may also know from the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ classes that stem cells are un@@ mature cells which can turn into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has a stem cells , but very few . they are in deep , small kid@@ neys of the brain are hidden from the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface fabric of brain mass in the surgery .
we made a more fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share them very quickly .
they die never before they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were maintained differently differently .
&quot; they were riding slowly and after a few weeks , she even died . &quot;
&quot; we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell death , which looked like stem cells . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand how they came .
they were of these cells .
this blue and red cells from Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you do not have 4 % of our grand@@ child cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage the fo@@ un@@ ites make it for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get to us ?
that is why we do not know .
we believe that they will participate in the healing of the brain as we found them in higher concentrations of brain damage .
that &apos;s not so safe .
&quot; but one thing is clear -- of these cells , we received our master cells . &quot;
we stand before a potential cell source that allows cer@@ eals .
we have to prove that we have to prove .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then the cells are exactly as cultivated as Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois as Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois .

&quot; in the last step , we went to the point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ov transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions answered : what happens when we happen these cells in normal brain tissue p@@ ments ? and what will happen if we do the same cells in damaged cells ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we could work with mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we drove the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they would go back home in a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear there . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we put an injury to and rei@@ mbur@@ sed the same cells , and now the cells of the cells are preserved . &quot;
here you see what we could see among the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been planned .
&quot; the evidence that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that made in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; here , we couldn &apos;t stop here . &quot;
&quot; these cells are also a mon@@ keys to recover from a brain damage ? &quot;
so exactly the mon@@ keys we do with a manual inf@@ ect@@ ations task .
they have to take feed p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable speed level , we had reached in the motor@@ ised Cort@@ ex the hand @-@ driven field . &quot;

&quot; exactly as it would happen , relaxing it spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are yellow and then try to recover them with the help of plas@@ tici@@ zing mechanisms . you can relax with a certain degree , as well as the mon@@ keys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the A@@ um has reached the degree of spontaneous recovery , im@@ plan@@ ing we had its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , they see the mon@@ keys that spont@@ ane@@ ously spont@@ ane@@ ously . &quot;
it can take about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from before injury .
it is not so precise and not so quickly .
&quot; now , as we see the cells of the cells : the same monkey , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ pl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting .
since this time we have found a lot more about this cells .
we can freeze them and later use them .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , e.g. in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream has still always been able to im@@ itate them with people .
I hope that I can show you soon as the human brain is the means to heal yourself .

&quot; in fact , the democracy in us is in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I met Greece , the newly selected Greek government was made to me as a financial crisis in the Euro@@ group . &quot;

&quot; at this point , I want to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy . &quot;
&quot; with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party &apos;s Communist Party , and even the Euro@@ group Group , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a true and democracy democracy . &quot;

that is my hate with the capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be employed to improve our lives , human talents and particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue to continue , what we understand among democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ es is defined as the corporate form of society in the outdoor and the poor as the majority of the government .
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
&quot; women , foreig@@ ners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to take the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to this exclusion . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was , and it is not only the right to re@@ lie@@ ve the poor , but important and critical of them that they have the right to political participation with the same voice in questions of coup . &quot;
the ath@@ etic democracy has not kept for long time .
&quot; like a candle , which is very light , it is also hidden quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democra@@ cies did not have its roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the gl@@ amor@@ ous revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ etic democracy focused on the free citizens and the employees of the poor , is based on our liberal democracy in the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately proce@@ eding for the ruling class . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy , the liberal democracy came to a complete separation of politics and economy , and the democratic process of politics . &quot;
&quot; in our current democra@@ cies since the time , at which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ subject struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually fell into the policy of the economy and they de@@ pressed . &quot;
do you know why the politicians do not have more than earlier ?
it is not located in a Deg@@ ener@@ ation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because that one may be in the government , and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics in the economy , and the areas are separated . &quot;
I did my hair with the capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about as a flock of des@@ per@@ ation that are so sustainable animals , of which they have nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ed them at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy , which is so far @-@ reaching economic crisis . the power of law is growing , political goods will continue to invest in ine@@ quality , and the managing director of corporations can invest in their companies to invest in cash . &quot;
&quot; according to the successful completion of capitalism &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from the democracy , the higher , the twin cycle , and the more bigger the separation of human labour force and the welfare of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if it is obvious , it is obvious that we need the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control reserves the control of &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; control reserves the control of &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; for women , women and foreig@@ ners . &quot;
that is not a new idea .
&quot; the Marxist left , this idea was already a 100 years ago and it was not very good . &quot;
the teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the workers will only be a position as in the ancient Athens without new species of gross and waste .
but there is one solution : the workers will create it !
&quot; capitalism does it , by reducing the low voltage , through automation and robots . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that long economy and politics separate areas can be higher , the automation is higher , and the social conflicts of deep , like it -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; we must unite the economy , and to unite the areas of economy and politics . &quot;
&quot; the question is not whether the capitalism makes the technical accompli@@ sh@@ ments that he has brought , it will survive . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether the capitalism is caused by a d@@ yst@@ one , similar to the man , or by something that the society in &quot; &quot; Star &quot; , &quot; in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ os &quot; ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life . &quot;
&quot; I believe , we must be optim@@ istic . &quot;

&quot; in practical implementation , I want to call you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : imagine a capital market , in which you work in money , and the company -- no matter how to work in the next , and the company -- regardless of which you are working in the company -- it is owned by the company currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and multip@@ lication , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but do not work in it , and the employees who work there are not . no do@@ cking more between capital and work , there are no major gaps between investment and sp@@ ies , and ultimately doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy : make sure that our national cur@@ ren@@ cies have seen a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be presented by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest foreign countries &#93; , in interest of the whole of humanity . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the fact that the whole pupp@@ ies in this currency , we call it &quot; &quot; Kosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos no . &quot; &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;
that is not new idea .
it is basically the reason that John May@@ n@@ ard key@@ nes is proposed in the board of 1944 Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that this was not the technical means .
&quot; today we have them , especially before the background of a re@@ arranged policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I gather you , is at the same place where they privileged persons , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the rest of the history , and key@@ nes@@ i@@ tis , global key@@ nes@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
to wake up in such a world
or are we in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ one .
the answer depends on how we decide to make us together .
&quot; it lies in our hands , and we do do it better . &quot;
thank you .

in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the idea of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy on politics , while the field of economy -- a totally democratic bourgeois zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I should say that it should not say , similar to China today the England of the 19th century . &quot;

&quot; what you can see in China , similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;

how do you have six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new account with the Eurozone . &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; therefore , the development of the European Union is a massive decline in the development of the European Union , and continues to be threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to sign on the basis of the Greek pre@@ ten@@ ant -- of the way , the first proposal was the first proposal for this condem@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the EU group , continue to deny the condem@@ nation . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union .
&quot; if you try to get a economic system that is not excessive , through political will and authori@@ zation . &quot;

&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any ministers , after 6 months in the ministry , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I have made mistakes .
the largest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program .
I believed that there were a honest interest on the pages of the monetary system .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to do our government , just because they wanted to deal with the en@@ dow@@ ment through the Eurozone . &quot;
they wanted to admit that she had a dis@@ astro@@ phic programme in Greece .
we lost one third of our speech B@@ IP .
&quot; since it is worse than the &quot; &quot; big depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one from the Tro@@ ika of the monetary policy , which has given us this policy , &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ cop@@ al error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all the , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the conversations , appear to be quite right per person . &quot;
it is not posi@@ ble to insert more than one slider on the same page .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone against someone who lives in Europe and love .
the euro@@ zone has not survived the euro@@ zone .
&quot; for if they do not survived , the free radic@@ als are free and the European Union shall destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be alone for Europe , but for the whole economy . &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy of the world .
&quot; if we move to the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , will it be possible for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;

&quot; probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
&quot; this goes back to the decision , the Roy was met before three years . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is conduc@@ tive in Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company of Amazon .
America &apos;s strongest allies expect a clear commitment to the trans @-@ Atlantic security partnership

&quot; it makes more idea about the medium out@@ break , the average television -- the shows that does not have good or bad , they just don &apos;t need . &quot;
so he must ensure that it is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course , it is also the first time that Amazon is so something to do with Roy &apos;s demand . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
he requires guaranteed success but he holds a competition .

does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK . that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one has ever ever been in touch with this software .
&quot; if someone wants to be found in the US in prison and in order to declare , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a situation is done or not . &quot;
&quot; but instead of Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of to decide whether a show is good or bad , if a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that cannot be bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this is not that a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems don &apos;t know how to use data .

&quot; despite all of these errors in decisions of life , a -- at workplace , at the workplace , in medicine . &quot;
so we should prefer that data are helpful .
&quot; also I have a lot of difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- a field , in which some very clever people don &apos;t use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy . &quot;
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be widespread . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complex problem , do you do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first you put this problem in its categories , so you can easily analyze the details as two or two to put the details in order to capture a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but it &apos;s always two things : apart and again . &quot;
&quot; data coverage : market sizes ( historic and forecasts ) , company shares , brand shares and distribution data . why buy this report ? &quot;

they are not suitable for use the parts again and then move to a connection .
there is another tool and we own all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good when the brain is good , it &apos;s a piece of parts and pieces , even if the information is un@@ fully available , it is particularly useful when it is the brain of a experts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think that Net@@ fli@@ x was successful because they have used data and understanding , where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience better . but the decision how to take all these parts , put together a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that they went a big personal risk with this decision .
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; they used data to control all its decisions , first as they chose to create TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as an show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things could run out when the data is going to control our decisions . &quot;

&quot; I have had some choices in my life , where I should hear on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , you want to know that if you have the data available , you would like to replace this by something much higher than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic setup .
&quot; it is perhaps the ball multip@@ ly and delicate . however , it is to be able to meet decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right . &quot;
&quot; and I don &apos;t find this as very encouraging news , that despite the large amount of data still will be charged to make decisions , an expert in which you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because of the end , it is not the data but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
