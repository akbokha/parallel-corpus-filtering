<seg id="829">Perhaps you may also know from the biologieclasses that stem cells are unmature cells which can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has a stem cells, but very few. they are in deep, small kidneys of the brain are hidden from the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface fabric of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a more fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share them very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="834">But these cells were maintained differently differently.</seg>
