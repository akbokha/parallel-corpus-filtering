now the White House of Tr@@ ump on the statue of the statue of Tr@@ ump
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is to start when they start the stat@@ ues .
the Americans appreciate this as any other - therefore the sor@@ cer@@ ess of Sad@@ dam H@@ uss@@ one on the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did , as he did a symbolic A@@ sher with Jim A@@ co@@ sta . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
&quot; after all , there was a lot of boat of boat and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators who would have done it . &quot;
&quot; but he handle their meaning , and in particular the meaning that ye have been written as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the thinking , its basis was added . &quot;
&quot; it is a symbol of American freedom , but the freedom of statue is a symbol of American freedom . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to the later , was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is right , but as it itself is form@@ ulated , it is not really the history of history . &quot;
&quot; it goes around the contemporary words of Laz@@ arus , who is not just any old one , but the anger of the poor , but the anger of the poor : &quot; &quot; your fatigue , your arms ; &quot;
there was never a time to see in the &quot; el@@ ent waste &quot; on our screens .
4 . - Relevanz : 100 % 1 BvR 939 / 13 Abstract of the Order of 25 June 2015
this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America .
&quot; Laz@@ arus - and her friends who want to place their words after her death at the base - I knew very well , that she was a highly political act . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American politi@@ ci@@ ism .
&quot; Laz@@ arus changed these meaning : in their poem , the female character is not abstract - she has received a voice . &quot;
Quelle : the Hollywood Reporter
the connection of the image with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a tremendous attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus is the significance of the statue , they wanted to change people from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the large collection of the statue of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tist for the Com@@ ms of Tr@@ ump , and was rather a early warning , the American flame into the surrounding world , &quot; Lady Liberty . &quot;
they shall carry the F@@ ack@@ el of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the F@@ ack@@ el should not give the way into the United States .
next@@ last first previous Photo Properties
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the perception of perception .
&quot; the big dictatorship of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they see from the in@@ exhaus@@ tible , but hop@@ eless people after long and often horri@@ ble jour@@ neys to the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
it continues to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the Will@@ ingness to hear them .
&quot; and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to recognise . &quot;
&quot; her F@@ ack@@ el shall not give the way light , but the hatred , which is their only source of power . &quot;
the World Cup 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ af members of the teams of the Great Britain
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds at a time , than two bul@@ let@@ ins for the team of Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; the performance of the light athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece sh@@ aded cont@@ actor is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of sch@@ ot@@ tic athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand and we will continue it until we &apos;ll find out until we &apos;ll find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
&quot; I speak with people in Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has done something with that , what they did . &quot;
&quot; the athletes think that it has to do something with that , what they did . &quot;

&quot; as always the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;

&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were s@@ ot@@ or or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very proud . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling of course , the E@@ ili@@ d@@ h was all of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth solid silver med@@ alli@@ ons , which is in the fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m system , says that it is &quot; incredibly brilliant , &quot; that 16 pins are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world was seven , the 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Mu@@ ir leads to this way and has been set up in the past year five British and two European records . &quot;
&quot; it will be held at 1,500 m and 5,000 m away . &quot;

&quot; it is a great honour to know that they have chosen from the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour , but to know that my team went to me , makes it very special for me . &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ r@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;

the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans said George Washington , but it took a long time until the newspapers still sw@@ allowed him because of the inner policy until his political principles . &quot;
January February March April May June
but he has not brought his cri@@ tic to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech may be taken away and , &quot; &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; we will be like the sheep for sleep . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mar@@ yland , H@@ ogan , who has to work on to work more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans have the contributions to at least 450 people and have deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the German Civil Liber@@ ties Union is at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the court of the Gover@@ nor had brought the rest as a fri@@ ghtened , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ act with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a bourgeois dictatorship in a overwhel@@ ming democratic country that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the two th@@ wart@@ ed approval of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a reac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very pleased to use Facebook as a pri@@ c@@ res means to connect with his ex@@ ams and play his mature head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the site of the Gover@@ nor - the public forum is referred to as officially , and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars . &quot;
&quot; in a interview with The Washington Post Director H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Spe@@ aks , the actions of the Gover@@ nor and trans@@ former that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a Moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ wel@@ s or sp@@ ikes or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which do not use the p@@ eit@@ ing swing . &quot;
&quot; the post said , with some of the real people that have been blocked by H@@ ogan . &quot;
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their selected leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no Tro@@ ll . &quot;
they all told that their comments are resp@@ ect@@ ful and not professionals .
the past@@ ors show the Bible into his post and app@@ el@@ ent of H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyers , Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ w , MD . &quot;
&quot; I think that I was dis@@ appointed , that there was no reaction on Hass@@ le@@ vers and other current news , &quot; wrote in the comment section of the news &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this idea is not to be recognized as a number of people on the same topic , they will not be recognized by some more than a so @-@ called collective strategy and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor as &quot; concentrated anti @-@ spam &quot; would probably call others &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , a new method for medical assessment of their algae , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people older than 18 years are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of this results . &quot;
the Swedish authority of For@@ ens@@ ary medicine ( R@@ saturated fatty acid ) has begun with the implementation of the tests in the past year .

&quot; in 432 cases the conclusion was the conclusion that the person &quot; possibly at 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is given in question .
&quot; on the way to Joh@@ an Gö@@ ran@@ sson , the forum of sic Medicine Agency , are the results for the last months . &quot;
&quot; we see no major difference in the statistics of the past months , numbers are quite constant &quot; , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was assessed as more than 18 years , does not necessarily imply that the asylum seek@@ er has made about his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency reported the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 442 cases , that the under@@ graduate person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ sts the 5@@ 81 published results , they found that in 243 of these cases the person had been said that they were in this year 18 years old . &quot;

I had the reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that kind of measurement should be used .
the biological age on this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; if we cannot say , we should not do so as if we could do it , &quot; he said the newspaper web . &quot;

&quot; at the first glance it looks like a statue , if there is a fri@@ ghtful place . &quot;
we have found researchers found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian rock strike was well received so that experts as a &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; was described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his natural skin of r@@ asp@@ ed brown was - and they said , they would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Issues &quot; has been published as &quot; &quot; the be@@ wit@@ ched Din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l is a newly designed type of No@@ zzles that lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well preserved condition , researchers used to describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the cru@@ el plant species is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of his kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that was missing from the rocks , on the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
the Royal House of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology was sent to the Royal Detective Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
you spent the next six years to cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy soil ero@@ sion .
&quot; after all of this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a little bit with the eyes , you might think that it has said , &quot; &quot; said the main objective of Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to see . &quot;
&quot; it is in the Science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved , Din@@ osau@@ rs &apos;s copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant @-@ gl@@ ut@@ amine , although it is covered with a harness , and a trans@@ genic tank , probably of meat @-@ breeding Din@@ osau@@ rs has been threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strong and white din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white Tar@@ gets to hide from the rap@@ ture , and used a comp@@ action technology that is known as a counter@@ part , which is also known by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to mix better in its environment , and to help his enemies , say , what it means that there was a bigger Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old Kre@@ ator from the family of No@@ stal@@ ker has been made up in May for the first time and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have created wild beast and es Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli by the Museum@@ st@@ acker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours . &quot;
&quot; the amazing preservation of the copy , it allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of Schu@@ ppen and le@@ aks over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the con@@ ter@@ ated , a most widespread method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark than their under@@ side . &quot;
the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta could be seen as far as the size of the living animals .
&quot; it indicates that the Din@@ osau@@ rs has enough pressure by meat of the din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the wear used as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; most of the contemporary animals that use the con@@ ter@@ at@@ ability - think of them , z@@ eb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and injuries than prey , what sign@@ aling these no@@ ises will be exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dator behavior on a massive , severely silent din@@ osau@@ rs , like dangerous the Din@@ osau@@ rs @-@ animals of the Krei@@ de@@ time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skel@@ etal shows that the skin of the Din@@ osau@@ rs red brown was red .
&quot; scientists examine the animal on information about his life , including its con@@ ser@@ ed Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to find what it has eaten it than his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the Din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , and he died in a river and in the sea , where he was laid on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time , Alber@@ ta so warm like south @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and ocean probably much further land as they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ stal@@ k is really remarkable , because it remains complete with con@@ ser@@ ed skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of the animal reserves , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the beast is almost as well as in the early circle .
you don &apos;t need much fantasy to do it . if you are only a bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the Krei@@ d time was a time , as a huge ther@@ op@@ ium of the din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the Earth &apos;s ground . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was lived in the din@@ osau@@ rs of some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; it is the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ep@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings in the trade journal published , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta after death in the sea . &quot;
&quot; the Kre@@ ator was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he found on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the be@@ sto@@ cking , din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is entirely of the car@@ avan to the head . &quot;
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have been washed up to 3.000 pound ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it took two 20 inches long points , which are made by his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that in the Western Canada is sh@@ aded through the Western Canada , until an floo@@ ded flow it was floo@@ ded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater equipment of the Din@@ osau@@ rs and his Arm@@ oured in exquisite item detail .
&quot; the remn@@ ant remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so good , that the Hau@@ tre@@ m@@ ets are still ste@@ amed along the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , a level of conservation , is such a level of conservation , such as a profit . &quot;
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
the remn@@ ant remn@@ ants of the skin do still cover the hol@@ d@@ guard plates that carry the skull of the animal .
it is not the for@@ giveness of for@@ giveness .

&quot; what in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in the cinema from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of the survival and the Protest@@ ant , the strength and the loss of the strength of the strength and the resistance , which is made from the view of the people who lives in the community , and the streets are filled in order to ask answers . &quot;
&quot; as a fer@@ rell with her daughter , a cau@@ li@@ am dress and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on : &quot; &quot; the two a conversation , which she had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;

&quot; I could not take you with you , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
&quot; what is happening now , is a highlight of which ... what is happening in the past . &quot;
you must know and see it and it will be deduc@@ ted .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activity and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck you have an experience , where they personally don &apos;t know how to make it personally as the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would be able to hold a poor man to keep it far away . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Road , a place opposite the police authorities , which was to be a camp behind the police . &quot;
Fer@@ rell and her daughter was connected with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves them to disman@@ tling them .
slowly began a new kind of activity for fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activity has been modified according to the 9th August at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis on the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , and at the essence of justice and health ine@@ quality in black communities . &quot;
I had no experience in organizing organisation .
&quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later met Fer@@ rell during a evening ceremony Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her Camer@@ oon Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question of Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; you will be document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this Sk@@ ep@@ sis has been submitted by many cases of people , often from white - in a community that removes their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who have born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up their voices , and we wanted to make it differently differently . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose is the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsers . &quot;
&quot; this documentary film is not someone who speaks for us , or with us . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be displayed , as so I will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a Messi@@ ah leader but in order to show a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life , how she married and her wife married . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell and la@@ stly , when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that it must be possible at this work and at the human &apos;s position of black people . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Fer@@ ry &apos;s role is the role of black pregnant women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Matter &quot; in social media are identified as pregnant . &quot;
&quot; black , pregnant women in driving positions have been carried out in the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we fight constantly on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; red , pregnant women must have to carry out the main load of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an idea , to note that &quot; the movement is truly of black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it is highly recommended that &quot; &quot; this is not the vi@@ mati@@ cally type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell , due to their identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; it was the person who set up this energy , &quot; said she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no chance , although she was in front front , because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , pregnant woman so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen .
&quot; however , the problem is that the problem is that there is no need to change the problem . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is a demonstration for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a demonstration .
they describes the social atmosphere of the area that they called her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;

&quot; while the fears may be able to build a gallery more customers in the city , which will also benefit from the other shops , fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the gallery will be able to offer exactly on the grounds of the farm , on the farm @-@ market hall , in the 13 Gover@@ nor of their products . &quot;

there is enough enough in our city .
you can see how many shop shops are empty - some since months and years .
&quot; as there is no longer a weekly market , it is the more important that we will get at least the marking of the market . &quot;
&quot; ( users Viewing this Forum : 2 ) 2,@@ 08@@ 4 173 Foto@@ schule in tauchen ! &quot;
&quot; if you see , shop shops are available in a shopping basket only by larger firms , for the dor@@ sal rental are often not portable . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a p@@ ity , special shops , there is almost no more and that which is still left , will probably be disappear . &quot;

&quot; above all , where the peas@@ antry , during the construction time ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on the duration , when the bit gallery is actually worked . &quot;
or do you want to drive a bit bit or try to drive all the shops out of Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is just not work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which is empty , needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a right peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are no translations available . &quot;

&quot; and they were simply pressed her , they are great people . &quot;

&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people can rent a room for rent and then set up an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot . &quot;

&quot; there is a recording of a rebel@@ lion , the 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ fe family of Kent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;

&quot; other stories are firmly established in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit folk , who tells the story of the Jes@@ uit seven years in the English Reformation . &quot;

they want to feel human beings that they feel the movement of a real body .
&quot; however , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , the robot is no real women . &quot;
they cannot go away from their companion or simply leave .

&quot; at the same time , there is a binding of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political gap , which have created the US dollar , also families in the small @-@ format . &quot;

&quot; we are str@@ anded together all the suppos@@ edly , to let our filter blad@@ der . &quot;
the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps has been prepared to bring families .
&quot; I mention this , because my C@@ ous@@ ine , a lin@@ ks@@ bury poet , who lives in Chicago lives and has been busy with the Republi@@ can in our family who has visited this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unit may have a powerful enemy .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows she knows , including the people &apos;s relatives , with which they had fought for decades , suddenly , and completely independent on the same page . &quot;
&quot; in order to create the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it falls in another way that this is also considerable risks with themselves . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the un@@ mistak@@ able effect of his Presi@@ dency has the strength to push us all after the right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ass@@ roots possibility that we will no longer get out of one day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a lack of long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Charter of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; , which appear on once in comparison to his standards and suddenly appear in comparison to his standards . &quot;
&quot; I am happy today from a active No@@ stal@@ gie for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ani for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ani , and the dog on the car &apos;s roof , which was 14 % of income ( but at least that , as his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact , indeed a very mild stra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump is , the next candidate has to quali@@ fy the next candidate in the world , to quali@@ fy as a vital enhancement to quali@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; as my C@@ ous@@ ine in the city was , we spent our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in the Central Park , the biggest in the city of the New York City Department , and the best three dollars which one can spend in the city if you have no c@@ aff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are extremely large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kno@@ cked , and the animals cho@@ oses to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ es and the cli@@ ff of music creates this on a noticeable way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide plenty of excitement , and the reality of the city will not be righteous . &quot;
&quot; thirty years later , and I am still not over the day when I found the Swiss Cot@@ tage in fact no Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the subject @-@ pub Y@@ E Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a large round@@ trip in the north of Lon@@ d@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as here two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ star and two women in the 40 @-@ years , and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I would have seen the car@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him the full score score , but for luck , nobody was asked for happiness . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I could handle my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to buy up with a 15 % drinking water - this to buy something about the load . &quot;
&quot; this does not only mean to fall am@@ bition of what actually is a neutral , but also pressure on the server , in order to create personality in a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the purchase haus was sorry , but I tired the experience that you made my credit card with five stars . &quot;

&quot; cells which can be able to prevent inflammation , and protect the tolerance , and protect the tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissue . &quot;

and the bacter@@ ium needed tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of Prot@@ eins - around the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial and Lac@@ tob@@ ac@@ illu@@ s reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;

&quot; she loved that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ds of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ine life . &quot;
the D@@ ji@@ bs were found in the mice were found in the mice they were found in the mice with the immune cells but without they were missing when they were missing .
mice were removed in a ster@@ ile environment so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was not developed and they received these kind of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria of the immune system , the researchers investigated the researchers into a fluid and over@@ led the small amounts of liquid , without the bacteria - on un@@ mature immune cells . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ances of toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component from the fluid was cleaned , it was known as a secondary product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ aboli@@ sm , which is known as In@@ fer@@ rous @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers show the quantity of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values were semi @-@ treated , the number of cells around half is half . &quot;

the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was covered by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hat@@ ch Act .

H@@ MX @-@ 1 maintains no Bud@@ get@@ ary names for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost for the event .
&quot; according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ sts of the US Defence Ministry for the household year 2017 is the Do@@ D @-@ Er@@ rors for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
&quot; for the flight time , flight time of flight is 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Cor@@ ps Air Facility in quantity . &quot;
the White House has adopted the actual costs for the operation of the helic@@ op@@ ters far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for the tax burden on the estim@@ ation of estim@@ ation , is highly misleading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; estimates include personal , maintenance , and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;

&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state Connec@@ tic@@ ut very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I am sure that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on our national security . &quot;
&quot; and I think how most Americans are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked . &quot;
&quot; of course , of course , of course , of course , of course . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helic@@ opter flight , when he came to his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down into the driver &apos;s seat . &quot;

not once the parents were born .
&quot; I never told me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a call for others , &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the real problem at the education of sexual abuse was , and it is that most victims died out of shame . &quot;

&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : an experienced student form@@ ulated it as : &quot; &quot; in the case of sexual abuse ... I see no case , in which he would have had been exp@@ elled and the respective member states . &quot;

&quot; the former Dom@@ aine Master of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look at the report of &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Quelle : the Hollywood Reporter
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : that &apos;s a great issue that in the reporting everything was mixed and ver@@ ted to a huge Mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is an issue of the report .
&quot; there is clean separated , between the pre@@ school and the hotel of the Cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , and say , we say , rest . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report of the report from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Cathedral . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , all of the horri@@ fic terrorist organizations , the cases , in which boy of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ ckers were killed and mal@@ ign@@ ant , all of them were killed at school school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ inn@@ y states . &quot;
&quot; but with which had Dom@@ aine Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do , for he got to face the boys as they were already on the Dom@@ ination River . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , like the most witnesses , the theme &quot; Summer School &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to be happy and the so much better treatment and so much better treatment and for many of them .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ asi@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was no discipline , but not no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report said to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of general humanity was estimated , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence and even positive memories of violence . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it remains at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported on the pre @-@ school education . &quot;
&quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , as he began to establish itself and from the predec@@ essor to a school , at which he did not hear and responsible , ( so the witness ) did nothing to hear and then again in 1993 . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will consistently systematically become the ears of the ears . &quot;
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , as in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ weiler deport@@ ation , which is even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this context , it is in fact that in the pre @-@ school will continue to be practic@@ ed in the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of the danger of the negative press release , he has urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time , as a legal basis , as a testing stra@@ ction is also forbidden in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they stayed in a legal grey zone , like everyone of us . &quot;

&quot; but also this must be said : without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , it would probably be possible to form a institution of pupp@@ y of Europe and its musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;

&quot; those who are not for@@ given him up to today , so that he was strictly enforced in the minority . &quot;
most of them are grateful for him that he has brought her life and gave them the world of the music .

we can be glad that we have long been over .
