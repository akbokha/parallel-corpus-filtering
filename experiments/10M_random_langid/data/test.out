&quot; even here , there would be no lack of women in refugees . &quot;
&quot; this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the Munich north , trau@@ mati@@ sed them . &quot;
some of the children are certainly not involved .
many women are as usual that they are nothing to say .
or they dare not speak openly about the experience because the threshold is too large .
&quot; since they often don &apos;t help to help , it would be more accommodations for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;

but the visit had a additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is on the west of the west , since it is considered to be a weak response as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continuing commitment to the EU acc@@ ession to the EU acc@@ ession negotiations and Putin - which is to reduce it from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west . &quot;
the Russian president won in Ankara with the security of a bonus that he tried to get the coup leader for the selected state organs .
&quot; this is for Moscow with a self @-@ conscious , which has a profound fear before reg@@ im@@ e@@ . &quot;

&quot; however , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently been a part of peace in Moscow but where Russia and Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it could be that after almost three hours of first interview , both president on the press conference said that they would not have been stolen . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Turkey enters into a question about her differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size them . &quot;
it is not clear that it is not clear that where to be found in Syria can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months , fine d@@ sel@@ ectively - and in view of the pot@@ ency as a perfect disper@@ sion , as the NATO member of Turkey &apos;s Russian fighter - is certainly better that the two state leaders are at least once again . &quot;

&quot; why we are Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . &quot;
that is what I am under the Women &apos;s Olympic Games in the tower and that of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have since 1984 at every summer Olympic Games and the US were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three tur@@ tles , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lauren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which was inspired by many young girls with other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the jew@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ ke , the Cath@@ kin , makes it very proud . &quot;
this team reflects the USA .
it has led the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sports art .
&quot; in the last four years the number one was one among the female Tur@@ ns , an Af@@ ro @-@ American soldiers . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
that shows strength .
&quot; in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas is a surprising event of the Olympics and America . &quot;

&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie . all the same way like A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad of the team is only four turbin@@ es in the team . furthermore , the last year with Mart@@ a kar@@ oly@@ i was the first year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns will be more expensive sports , and they are in the first line in private sports , which can be used by parents and their cam@@ pers , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their supp@@ orter and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these athletes have to support the business in prosper@@ ous subur@@ bs that can support the business .
&quot; in these Ver@@ sions , their entire workout and this is the most expensive and long @-@ term engagement . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ees by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both their athletes have begun with the turbine . &quot;
&quot; we must be inspired to the congreg@@ ations , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie inspired to allow much more accessible sports training . &quot;
I was founded in the foundation of 20 years .
&quot; in my events we have a free and affordable turbin@@ es in Harlem for more 15,000 @-@ year @-@ old people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ i ) , and national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will be able to earn Detroit ( my home town ) expanded to learn from the youth high @-@ quality turbin@@ es , which have the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and nature for the spirit . &quot;
this combination provides food for health and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , for thousands young girls to bring about the Tur@@ ns , and it &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
that &apos;s a so exciting time .
&quot; thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for these real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team , and thank you to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;

&quot; for att@@ acker , the technique is similar - move your body from the shr@@ ine line , take the weapon and rotate them , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn off the weapon out of his grip before they move backward and the weapon on him . &quot;

&quot; from public funds to the rail@@ ways to sink of toilets , the task builds his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;

in the film he was able to meet his call upon any case .
the only thing that he was ab@@ sent was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ er@@ ical number of over 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the lung cancer is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there were a Russian toilet , which he refused to recover its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands a less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Mountains , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ fication of various places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; this is the worst thing that I have in a toilet . &quot;

French court re@@ jects engagement on A@@ br@@ iss from shops on the jungle of Refu@@ gee Camp
&quot; a French court , an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais was rejected , dozens of provis@@ ional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a judicial system , the authorities in Cal@@ ais is that the state was to have been established in Cal@@ ais , including cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser , or tea for 50 cent ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in the provis@@ ional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais was born that these places should be torn apart , because they would be a parallel economy , who would have no taxes , and a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; the court ruled that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that supported by the state of government and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they are placed in addition that the provis@@ ional shops and restaurants often have private accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille , that there is no legal basis for the review of people who would have no legal basis for the execution of people who are based on 72 provis@@ ional shops , but also spati@@ ally to be able to be aware that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais is absolutely impossible . &quot;
&quot; the judges Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants will play a much larger role as merely a people who live in extremely pre@@ dominant conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet location points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places , which was threatened from the lower level was the back book for kids &apos; café at the camp , English and French classes , and 200 meals on the day , English and French classes as well as an advice to asylum seek@@ ers , non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;

&quot; for singing is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard Hack@@ ler from the German award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; most people sing in the choir and share with equality , the joy of music , describes hack@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; through regular assembly , sen@@ sing social contacts may also take care of social contacts . &quot;
&quot; for frequently , social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;

&quot; at the same time , they need to concentrate on their own voice and to concentrate on the other singers - that &apos;s a great potential challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people who live alone , do not want to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; one of the most positive aspect is the recognition that man receives through the singing in the choir , tells hack@@ ers . &quot;
a enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .

&quot; however , if I don &apos;t want to take arguments for my particular wish , let me let me take the attention to the dis@@ counted charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ tin has already been perceived as it was in Sydney , it was the last 16 years in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so that many times I had had , did not know that it is at all around a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
&quot; although the US athletes join the competition , it has never been a med@@ al in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines from which it has been made up to the end of 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share their prizes for women and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for women .

details about use or usage possibilities are also interesting .
at this point I should admit that I was not an expert but only a well @-@ bound enthusiasm .
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ ised potential - the cardboard box of his never s@@ wollen up - but also the gra@@ z@@ ie of the gym and diving , the two sports that were essentially essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means much means as &quot; jump &quot; . &quot; &quot;
jump to navigation . jump to content .
&quot; according to official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ gram after execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for athletes from 17 countries , 16 males and 16 women , will take place in Rio . &quot;
the state of the Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ ons have to continue in their aspi@@ ration to gold , faster , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes , and back , after the top and down below the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie , or the output wall , but in the television transfer , also another pol@@ arity goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the target aspi@@ ration is no@@ bel , admi@@ red , admi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it &apos;s also that I find myself at the look of this game as something terrible .
of which the trampoline provides a breath@@ ability .
the V@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
it is not that the movement of the movement is not the goal .

there are numerous problems that cover everything from the bottom @-@ up to the dice in relation to power of the reg@@ ression coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the reg@@ atta Party and its allies will control the last seat of the opposition and control over 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ten@@ sions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight against this z@@ ack@@ able , controversial line required in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analysis of analysis is that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ liberation front or the National Socialism , the front @-@ front or the nation@@ alist front @-@ front , which could have more or less per@@ ished , the turbin@@ es were able to rise up with armed forces . &quot;
&quot; several factors seem to explain why the feelings of the bit@@ es after years ago , was explosive under the surface now . &quot;

&quot; in the past few years , many of Ethiopia were in the position to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones have been more often more common , and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in prot@@ agon@@ ists , many people still do not communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , where they can hold . &quot;
multiple young people gave them that they gathered together to the prot@@ ons .
&quot; the second factor is that it has more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ anol in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since the nin@@ ete@@ enth century the Am@@ har@@ as the Am@@ har@@ as , which are predomin@@ antly predomin@@ antly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they live in the O@@ ro@@ mos , where many Muslims are living in flat land . &quot;

the biggest protests were found in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tiger group , which are reduced by 6 percent of the population , and in the military , in the secret services , in trade and politics . &quot;

&quot; he was seen as a tactical Genie , a man who could think of the corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that it was especially economical in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special attention to use opponents and to make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the present regime is missing to this fundamental theory , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia of New Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to make the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; differently than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Nord@@ hagen , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , we say that it is not the confidence of the tiger controlled security services . &quot;

&quot; however , this is not the intensity of the internal imp@@ air@@ ment of the Ethi@@ op@@ ian government . &quot;
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month the Protest@@ ant in G@@ ond@@ ar , a am@@ har@@ an city , by Tig@@ ray , shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray will always be taught in the social media . &quot;
analy@@ tiker say that the protests against the USA and other Western allies will bring together to a independent position .
the U.S. government used the Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights to the neighbouring Arab countries even if it has recently announced that they have been closed this basis .
&quot; while the west is clearly the democracy wants to support democracy , he does not want to develop its allies . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ antly . &quot;

Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton interven@@ ed to economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump again had to return back to this topic . &quot;
Originaltitel : law &amp; Order : special Vic@@ tims Unit ( TV )
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought his defence against his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he was strong criticism to himself as he thought , the Russians should take care of Mrs. Li@@ sts E@@ mails , but he was later on . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump the linguistic limits in politics and then back to the requirement .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how specific messages from his fans , how it falls , and then &quot; &quot; how to &quot; &quot; in the reaction to the reaction . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert in which the language of both candidates are observed . &quot;
&quot; I believe that it is clear enough to keep his statements , so that they may be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump had accepted a number of figures for the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published in the Federal States North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;

&quot; but while he is more active in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps has brought his attention to the un@@ comfortable situation to him , independent of which , like prov@@ ok@@ eth his statements . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps celeb@@ ri@@ ties , gave a great effort to defend the candidates today in an CNN @-@ interview . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he was the author of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton was founded in the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama I@@ SIS had an almost unknown , little organization , he called them back , completely false , and so it happened , because he took the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most ma@@ instream classes are trying to declare that the government was under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a foreign ministers , it served as a foreign policy , the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump his attacks on the media , and cast his attacks on the media and cast them on each of his words , and put them against him . &quot;
&quot; he ver@@ ted the &quot; poor , j@@ ose &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t understand it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it was a act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Smith brick . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ E added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food types .
&quot; the first book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was born from the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick in its book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; over the life of the Lower East Side . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; a permanent meal that will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of the American cuisine during the big depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ ron in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in the store in 1929 in the business . &quot;

&quot; when the repor@@ ters arrived , this the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the big depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said brick . &quot;
&quot; it gave bread bread , liver saus@@ age and B@@ ohn@@ ing bread . &quot;
&quot; they were made from an en@@ du@@ ed and have a little space , which has access to the access . &quot;
&quot; make sure that they serve them as dinner , as they serve them as dinner . &quot;
Co@@ E grin@@ ning .
&quot; it must be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the big depression was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
teams of women are served for male field @-@ workers and it was served fresh@@ ly decorated past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner served . &quot;
&quot; they were the Americans , during the first World War II &apos;s food to hungry Europeans . &quot; &quot; a Square of meal &quot; is the way to make the land so that the land did not to be the Sch@@ lar@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the new Bud@@ get@@ ary &apos;s new Bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious foods such as Br@@ ote and K@@ asser@@ ole were taken up to basic food , the K@@ asser@@ y as &quot; wonderful way , the K@@ asser@@ ole has been recovered as &quot; wonderful way of vin@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate ingredients . &quot;
&quot; fresh fruit has been replaced by thousands , too . &quot;
&quot; meat , for years of the heart of the American cuisine , was a rare luxury luxury . &quot;
&quot; some of these items are linked to their companies , and can be added and edited on @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; while her report for the book , that also includes recipes , prepared a court from this time , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition on the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ E . &quot;
&quot; next : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions are not to each other .
it was typical for many of the guests .
&quot; as never before or since , during the last few years , they were able to develop and develop appliances from the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 - 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;

he went into an almost gold @-@ cup room and took a square .
he was delightful .
the President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would have been committed to the same mistakes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ ute him with his stomach .

&quot; many of the species from the era of the big depression , with food , was rejected as soon as the land came again on the legs . &quot;
&quot; on our continuing focus on calories and food , said brick , as well as science on food is applied . &quot;

&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope has helped to collect the most advanced catalog on Rot@@ ating rates among the stars of the star@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why the stars in the star , as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods can be integrated with the plant@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we can also experience our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a mountain , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a research fellow at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared , and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;

&quot; there are a number of houses in the former G@@ DR : 1990 , numerous homes in the former G@@ DR , including nearly all houses in the former G@@ DR near Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ board had been preserved , many of the projects in Riga was leg@@ alized , many of the projects in Riga was inhabited by the people who had lived before 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district is becoming increasingly becoming increasingly important for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world , with them to share their leadership from the G@@ DR in the past few years . &quot;

many of the new buildings in Riga will be attacked by symbols for this development .
no other street was mentioned in this year so often together with the words &quot; lin@@ ks@@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this is not all the neigh@@ bours that it could not be affected by the crimes that they are not necessarily affected by the crime .
&quot; as a result , the biggest part of the Stra@@ ft@@ ans make it possible to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
