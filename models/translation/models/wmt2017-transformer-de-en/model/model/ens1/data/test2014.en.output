Schools are getting more focused on math, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, pupils will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels starting in 1914.
The exam also includes "unhealthy texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils will have to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department for Education will publish the new curriculum for English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the auditor general, will announce a reorganisation of GCSE structures, including a new Benotation System and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous."
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on maths - 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement for more time for mathematics in the hourly schedule, coalitions say that the comprehensive maths test - combined with a greater weighting of the specialist in league tables - is likely to encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum places more emphasis on "problems from the right life," including financial mathematics.
Rapist in South Africa: Twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life terms on Friday.
This was reported by broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died from the aftermath of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act had sparked horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp, near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, doctors struggled to survive the victim, but to no avail.
The sight of the youngsters was so horrific that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar on Tatnight with Booysen.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he confessed to being responsible for the girl's death.
Police had initially run out of several perpetrators but dismissed two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
Prosecutors also stressed during the trial that she was convinced Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is already part of everyday life in South Africa: There are about 64 000 advertisements every year for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times more than in Germany, but with 82 million inhabitants than in South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a loving Kauz because he has decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart failure, Burt cannot get away from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations, and a mortgage on his old working statutes, he moves to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film, there's coffee, tea and cake.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to hold its customers in breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger misses among the stock exchange operator.
As recently as Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transportation.
In August this year, there had been two misses in a week alone.
First, because of technical problems, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent large-scale defective purchase orders to the option markets.
As a result, exchange operators needed almost a full day to look through and cancel orders.
Two days later, half of total stock trading in the US came to a halt because of a computer panic on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, Facebook's stock market went up last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been up to the flood of purchase and sales orders, later set the SEC's stock market watchdog record and donated the company to a record $10 million fine.
Intelligence reveler Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants his situation clarified.
That was made clear by the US-seeking former NSA employee in an unaddressed letter issued to Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the federal government, federal parliament and general state attorney general.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To the dependents
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was subjected to a serious and persistent hiding that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations prompted many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken into account have been visibly diminished.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a fiduciary and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this unacceptable position.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate properly and legally in the responsible investigation of the facts of the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Driver who was toddled with 210km / h and hot drink between legs gets £1,000 fine
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He was given seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs of £90 as well as a victim allowance of £100.
Uruguay drama: Young kill playmate with machetes
Two children have admitted murdering an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
With machetes and knives armed, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, the El País newspaper reported on Thursday.
They would then have played football in a working-class neighborhood in front of their apartments.
The corpse was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old boy's half-sister said she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the tathering without mentioning an attack against her before police, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, among other things, the elder called a rivalry in the football game.
He was provisionally transferred to a psychiatric youth ward.
Government in Jerusalem confirms attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, told the American news channel CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria's Latakia a day earlier.
The target had been "missiles and associated equipment," which the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Al-Arabiya Arab broadcaster, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been seized on Wednesday night on Thursday, blaming Israelis for doing so.
Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Newa missiles as well as a SA-3 missile battery that, according to Channel 2, has a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
Unsafe The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes a also anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
An Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman said anyway: "We are not commenting on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" would follow a military response.
Travel through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There aren't many doctors in the West African country, just one for 5,000 people
Tune in here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 in "CNN Heroes of 2013."
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to elect him to the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and travelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but then formed an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there that was supposed to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father into crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," Bwelle commented.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and isn't the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most campers could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped close to 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and ride with the crammed medical equipment on the roof over unleashed terrain to the villages in need of help.
Everything does not always go smoothly.
More than once, they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are received like heroes: A feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and boundless energy - is happy to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins investigating hundreds of patients.
"Per ride, we treat 500 people," Bwelle said.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village - and that's on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for school but many poor families simply can't afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the operation, patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
Lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
It's an exhausting penny, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're drumming up all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team then travels back to town, tired but proud of the work done.
The group - a mix of Camerunic doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that, with its work, it makes a huge difference to the people to whom it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a corpse he had received now allowed him to return to work.
"This is changing the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable work, Bwelle said; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who spent the second year studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteered to work in Bwelles Group.
He's always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we help to clamp down on blood or keep the instruments in place for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitation material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's quite undoubtedly a hero," O'Malley says.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, thereby fulfilling a promise he gave to his father, gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I make it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will convene new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually be involved in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
However, a cardinal who reaches an age of 80 can no longer take part in the pope's election - that falls to a group of 120 "eligible cardinals."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistorium.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene consistency in February in advance so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible Cardinals voters was likely to have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually harbours as many cardinals as he needs to, so that the number of eligible cardinals back 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistency next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, yet they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He declared it was "well possible" that Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice.
So far, however, we have not been in this situation - it is all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called to cardinals from large places, but stealing Francis "full of surprises - so we don't know who he is appointing."
Worker crashed from ladder: Seriously injured
When exchanging a defective outside sensation, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater at the outside facade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder attached to the rooftop, this one slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who care about prosperity and work in Britain want to change our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders, asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, representing roughly the UK's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the poll will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while EU states stagnate.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil to be favored by governments, rather than sticking with the long and strenuous process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
Asked about their view on certain regulatory issues - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe control of these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market because, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone - even 40% of large companies agreed with those that are traditionally most pro-European.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found at companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the heft of action back to Britain.
It's about a lot - a change in the deal and better terms for Britain would lead to a change of opinion at 16 per cent in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: This poll shows the UK economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the UK's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain from renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means greater attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hamburg will give a place concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock stock at 7.30pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners rejoice at the sounds of the Hammricher musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to successfully manage the first musical hock.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg lake board.
Under the guidance of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unqualified workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits would be varied: Participants would not be unemployed, firms would have trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to fund unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
Dog Friends Success
For the repeated time being, the sportsmen of dog lovers Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he put it up for 12th with 87 points.
With her woody in class 1, Susi Höpp faced the critical looks of the performance judge.
GM calls back new pickup truck in U.S. to repair seat rest
General Motors is calling back just under 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, according to a notice issued by the U.S. regulator for vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in head restraints.
"When driving up from the rear of the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM truck delivery began in June and represents the most important model launch by the leading U.S. automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car purchases in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, were up 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mother in forest disguised and pensions capped
When his beaten mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He begrudged the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
To continue to collect pension and foster benefits, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest, according to police investigations.
At first, he concealed the death of the 89-year-old, then took the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be held responsible for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: It was revealed at the time that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because the officials found this strange, they continued to investigate.
In doing so, it emerged that the two had lived in a shared flat for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old eventually admitted the death of his mother.
An obstruction did not yield evidence of a capital crime, according to police.

Highlander Games at Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking car with tractors, there is also a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
The Highlander Games start at 1.30pm on Saturday, September 7.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are weak on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of throwing trees, throwing huts and wearing water ice.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't come down to the far right," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The trunk must be discarded vertically, let itself be overturned once and then come straight for sunbathing.
That is assessed by most points.
In the case of stroke throwing, the target precision is important.
Thrown on a pedestal from an eight-metre distance.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by participants who wear water ice over 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a Bottich are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can be done as early as 10 o'clock.
A suitable dress is desired, for example the competitors can compete in the skirt of the Schottenrock.
However, Swabian costumes are also permitted.
For the "outfit," the jury still awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and tractor-pulling starting half an hour earlier, there has been plenty of action at the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass music lovers will get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the Biraböhmic brass music from Schömberg will create the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays fleet polkas and marches.
However, their repertoire also includes emotional walkers and a rich big band sound.
With this, Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be among the performers.
In Dornhan, he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten will entertain you in the early hours, the Böffingen farmhouse chapel will be open from 2 p.m. and the "Oldies" will finish the festival.
The Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf is already open on Friday.
Other programme points include the classic car and trawler meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the Maislabyrinth, the craftsman market and sheep scissors.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hill castle, tractor ride (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the tractor friends "ignition boxes."
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation, and one may wonder: What is preventing Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" Was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be non-constitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended arm of government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government, through the new law, "effectively takes the media into a stranglehold." By contrast, The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered "a serious blow," and called the draft "draconian."
The passage of the law is among a series of measures designed to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
Kenyan media attracted the wrath of authorities because they released footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping centre.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media official to interrogate, even if the preload was withdrawn following an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to a million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being barred from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "already a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere" in its description.
If they were to silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"None will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a crucial controlling factor in public life.
"Leave politicians to fend for themselves, run the country into bankruptcy and take us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
Kenyan lawmakers have faced public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to undo the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their defective salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month - they are among the world's highest.
2014 is Geisinger's festive year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Recurrence of the first primordial mention is getting ever closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and Kirche-Hausen were first mentioned together for the first time in 794.
A certificate has been produced in churches where both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this opening event will take place in the place where, 1250 years ago, both were first mentioned, in Churches-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in Churches-Hausen.
Churches-Hausen turns 1250 in July on a festive weekend from July 18-20.
Resurrection celebrate.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the church hall.
On this festive weekend there is also the Churches-Hausener Church Festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract position for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be published on the occasion of the "Geisinger Stadtjubiläum."
"However, it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's hostage ring, which consists precisely of Geisingen, Churches-Hausen, Leipzig, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And even today's Geisingen celebrates its 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present-day spaceship was performed with the congregations.
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014, though, is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festive banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipzig is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Polyhymnia Leipzig Music Association is 150 years old and celebrates this at the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in written documents in 764, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The certificate was produced in churches (Hausen), which was then court place.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years ago.
Also this year a Hubertusmesse will be celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St Hubertus was the saint after a rather ruthless hunter who converted through a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting hornblowing group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musically performed on Parforcehörner (Naturhörner in der Stimmung Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The leaves wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog dogs on trawl hunts musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It's a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces U.S. citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts struck down the side of the chamber's four more liberal members, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also upheld the view that the health law requiring states to either expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly opposed by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
The happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreamy camels
With this wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association as "helping hands."
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which has already had considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott for the first time in Mauritania in 2004.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the stakes were shown on a large canvas, allowing guests to take a picture of the anniversary event from the actions mentioned above.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work at the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn, in the record time of just over a week, created the hospital in Socogim, an elder district on the outskirts of the capital - volunteer.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be weaned in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner, Henne said, for example, deprivation against burn-out.
Due to political turmoil in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many medical professionals came to Germany to host here in various areas.
In addition, containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, composite materials, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colorite by telling of Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to mobile goat stall and describing the experiences of the regular musicians who traditionally support the club during their journey to Mauritania.
As his personal motivations, he called his work on auditing as a young MP.
When he realised how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also emphasized that global economies demand global human love, too.
Nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, as the front demarcation of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstraße before the renovation, is to be reinstated with the remediation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the Kilbig, during the first works of the reconstruction of the front school courtyard, a small angle wall was built to stabilize and static relief of the over a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next course of action, Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Municipal Building Office, plans to include the National Monument Office in the planning and to create a reconstruction plan for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the local council to decide and determine the further course of action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future, as a follow-up measure, the renovation of the confinement wall, which needs to be renovated from scratch, must be placed on new construction.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old school courtyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as no drainage is present, is in need of remediation and has a bogus tendency to move forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard to be used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
It was originally planned to restructure the school board even in 2008 / 2009, but high unscheduled spending led to a shift.
An important word in the historic school renovation, which has even been used for film recordings, will be the National Heritage Office.
If requirements come from this site, the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument protectors.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger elementary school, who are now again being taught in a well-renovated old school building with new apula, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport line told Twitter via the short news service that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
Media also reported several injured.
Us President Barack Obama will be constantly briefed on the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. eyewitnesses said to have seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as multiple media reported.
One traveller told CNN's broadcaster that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travellers would have cried and cared for children.
Among those waiting, panic erupted, many would have hid behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, a traveller tells the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security agency had suffered a gunshot injury on the foot.
The scene had been "like in a movie."
After that, he had himself been taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
Airport buildings evacuated
Television footage showed numerous hospitals and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken to safety from the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special operations commander and a gun lying on the floor.
As the airport line communicated via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30am in the morning (local time).
Access roads were blocked, forming a long backlog, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily halted, it said.
However, several fliers were also watching on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the US.
Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: The new B 33 pedestrian light at Dorfparkplatz was put into operation in Gutach on Tuesday - within sight of the older town hall lights.
Two plants so close to each other: Intent or thyroid strain?
That question clearly answered Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The small traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The facility officially opened yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossroads.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area - Grub ‹.
"At the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come to their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg District Council.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten percent are heavy road traffic," Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is simply happening here," Arnold said.
A total of four traffic views were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but again discarded because of the gap in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing area.
According to Arnold, everything was tested at the location of the traffic light masts: "By means of an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks, we have tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without trimming the traffic light masts."
The approximately 15 000 euro traffic light system itself is the "most modern thing that currently exists on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights of motorists, for example, can be easily detected even in the case of low-lying sun.
It is also economical: The older light systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This one is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"Should a group or handicapped people go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely across the carriageway," Arnold explained.
Of course, the car driver has to think of this as a partner and watch the carriageway.
This wasn't the case yesterday: Barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, screaming an upper-class vehicle through - with bright red.
Long breath makes you pay
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the stamina from Team Maier / Bronner decided the final match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went to the crucial stage.
The favourites Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner were equal with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to bring the decision.
In the victory ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking pot to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target straight.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze relay reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team asphalt drives.
In late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes, the tournament's successful sounding took place.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island re-released
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service that had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island has been released back into nature.
The water rush was flown last month by a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was snapped up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rush was probably a wintry train bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could no longer fly on, which is why we have been contacted for help."
On her release, the water rush was fit and healthy again.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between US and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-centimetre-measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they'd ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unseemly warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, authorities said.
Eight-and-a-half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured during the discovery of the tunnel, the court's records show.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to authorities, were charged with possession and intentional sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face a prison sentence of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, putting the drug cartels ahead of the challenge of how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a barely 640-foot-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "real-time test"
The government is considering a "real-time test" for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion designed to prevent the 457 being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was published today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments regarding foreign workers because these could be perceived as insulting by Australia's neighbours.
"Vociferous statements like, foreigners are supposed to turn up at the back" and, "recruiting Australians first," are a very unpleasant relapse at times when unions were calling for a protected labour market, "she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region wore an echo of this historical artifact, it wouldn't surprise me.
The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who yesterday joined talks on people smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "real-time criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker presumably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him since his father's death on Wednesday is being cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian place turns up with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the residents of a Norwegian village have brought light to their bleak valley.
Due to the low incidence of the sun, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 metres, a century-old dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!," swarmed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony at broadcaster TV2.
Some valley dwellers used sun chairs, others used sunglasses for safety.
So far, sun-hungry people have had to ride a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to channel the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea, though, has existed in the place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million kronor (around 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin on the morning.
Among other things, we are talking about direct democracy, parliamentary representation and the federal police.
In the morning, the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be the subject of conflicting ideas on both sides.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD backed its vote against a toll on cars claimed by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for multiple driving and therefore ecologically counterproductive," stated the SPD negotiator on the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasive traffic on country roads, which are already priority areas for accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll on all cars would be only a first step from Pronolds' point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Screaming Piepsen disrupts residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They are distributing the coal coming from the ships on the shelf.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind plant logistics.
Black skimmed the coal at the warehouse in front of the Deich.
Two massive blue shelf and rechargeable chargers distribute or recharge the coal here as needed.
Every time the transmitter moves, a screaming warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavourable winds, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city centre.
He takes the lawsuits very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, the 40-year-old says.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signs quieter with technical measures.
In the future, it will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has some things in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the coal mine port for power stations and is one of the big players in Europe in this sector.
Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be finished here for a long time now thanks to the sunbathing service in front of the terminal, which has been deepened to 18.5 meters.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-tonne mark in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, import coal goes to power stations in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power station goes on the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship trucks on the bridge, as well as the second conveyor belt, could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former nursery in Gartenstraße has sold the commune to a private person.
The sale agreed with the local council in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The congregation is satisfied," Maier stresses.
EUR 100 000 was set aside in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former nursery.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier joked.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more of a Halloween muffel.
Over the last two years, I have declared myself unwilling to distribute sweets from my flat, and will probably not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the United States Association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, soothing inanimate items are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect plenty of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk space dancers will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone in doing so to my amazement.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs."
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not timid.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate balls, slippers, bonbons and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who move through the neighborhoods with the splurge of "sweetness or saures," according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - make no mistake - eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is sugar-sweetened candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spuds.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
There are actually 1,200 officially recognised Spukhäuser in the United States, earning $500 million in proceeds, America Haunts said, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pinkle into the pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and one then the type you're headed for leaves a comment like "nice facial expression."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a pumpkin lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we made from small on.
Fortunately, the "baby in pumpkin" trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lateral, which slowly rotates in the front garden, presumably originates from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut something hard out of their 921 kilogram of heavy pumpkin.
Pimp must be jailed
The District Court sentenced Konstanz to three-and-a-half years in prison for exploitative trafficking, pimping, threatening, insulting and dangerous bodily harm, and sentenced a 33-year-old man from St Georgen to three-and-a-half years in prison.
The former federal military soldier, who worked as a doorsteer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
Consequently, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, whom he sent off against their will after a few weeks.
Resistance he used to break with violence and threats.
He retained the revenue of the women who, in part for years, made up for him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he interrupted contacts between women and the outside world.
Along with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he left them partly to monitor their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested major doubts about mental restraint and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old laid out a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, after an initial notice, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified through phone surveillance.
The abovementioned talks had been marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women discovered blue spots throughout the body, did not make a statement to this day.
It is "an utterly broken personality" who sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He had settled out of these circles and wanted to live a very normal life after being detained," he said.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
An investigation is being launched against former Labor minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales by the state corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denied having changed the rules on maritime detention at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings of three plots of land on government-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC ­ Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe without tender after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now being investigated over the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the plots, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The plaintiffs opposed it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought in $2.5 million a year to the Obeids, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally come out in favour of public tenders.
But he declined to make the changes to requests from Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government's poaching arrangements.
One of the phone records submitted to ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had switched to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drafting of commercial detention arrangements?" Asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia because of government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US did not use opportunities for foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his plethora of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders have become unsure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spiked Brazilian oil company Petrobas and seized data from American cloud suppliers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new high because of government surveillance.
The tide to overrun brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had waned, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Green, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT firms in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed an almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the company secrets of foreign companies to its own firms.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
It was suggested in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Yet reach and technical sophistication of the US spy authorities exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading body, following revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-US members dropped plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP's deputy managing director, says: "We are seeing a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago - it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these will remain physically in that legal space?"
Many German company leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That has always been the case.
"It has been an issue for many years and hasn't changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we are doing, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance does not normally boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that provides benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at car manufacturer Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
Germany's BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they go on foreign trips because smartphones may be compromised.
Prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
There is, however, concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect company secrets against unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own firms against economic espionage by other countries.
According to The Washington Post, in February, France, Russia, and Israel were ranked second behind China in the US National Intelligence Estimates, which used hacked economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The intelligence agencies know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies."
When horse chau experts took to Cardiff in droves to pick up the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was imminent.
But none was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only made his first moves a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trailed loosely through the three rounds and picked up the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally great, have been praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
In his appearance competing against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate skirts at a cheeky angle and carried the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which would be well above his age.
And Toffee received cutouts for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and has since practiced with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great mum."
They have had to compete against the entire field of participants and have gone off the pitch with gold posters and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over a decade.
Howells told reporters: "The whole audience was like electrified and everyone mocked him and clutched him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
Just as he's started, it won't be long before he's on the "horse of the year" show - and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse chau said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
Jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide - and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes did their part to make the fit really perfect to the occasion.
Foster Day at the small England hut
On the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project on upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley should be cut in the area of the cottage on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the glow of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care day was an appropriate tool for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time the tourist aspect can also be taken into account ecologically.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Natural Protection Department of the Federal Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by the Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be successful.
According to the Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view coincides with the aim of maintaining the now highly grown old Allawnfield with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to maintain your arteries.
Tribukait said she didn't want to miss out on breaking a lanze for the planned biosphere area at this point.
Not only is the current measure seamlessly integrated into this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved for the future with the Life project as well as the previous care days.
After these various presentations, Revierleiter Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten beforehand, the forest trailer may be ready to be retrieved.
A group of helpers should take care of the removal of wax bushes and the maintenance of a drone lock.
The goal was the free view at the vantage point.
Experiencing an entertaining afternoon with music
The Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors for coffee, cake and a Vesper for 15 years.
In the past, the elderly were cultivated in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon is taking place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The home residents joked about the delicious cakes and torches.
Later there was sausage salad.
With common melodies, Silvia entertained kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl kimmich.
Königsfeld: Small team beats wacker
The volunteer fire brigade handled its Herbsthauptprobe despite staff shortages with bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Departmental commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
There is supposed to have been a short circuit when sawing.
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and smoke development, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer first checked the situation, two responders of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building.
After a short period of time, the first person was able to find and live in the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It lasted a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another guided tour took place over a flood hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise in order to show what can be done with little available personnel.
In a serious case, support is provided via the daily operations group Königsfeld.
The commander showed satisfaction with the course of the exercise.
Iran pleased with process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is showing up a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vets and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dashawad Sarif wrote on his facebooks page.
There is still a long way to go, but the nuclear arms negotiator is happy with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution.
Rescue package over $325 million Australian $325 million for tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists the tough conditions associated with the $325 million rescue package for the tasmanian health service to ensure the state government can't waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease and system restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government deliberations with independent tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek explained today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million of emergency funding for election services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and gray star treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after hospital stays, specialist doctor education, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected me clinicians who said they were the best way to improve the tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian government.
The state would have to maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the extra money was spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I'm confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state's public health system off the sore list," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely offset recent cuts.
But the opposition's health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is just a "pavement solution."
"We are in today's position because the Labor state government has deducted $430 million from the health system," he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a state government to take nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and put 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend to be good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on extra red tape.
In protest at the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through its first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting is coming to an end without any results.
In the conflict over wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received association and association representatives at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than €1 million a year, which all the country's firms are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also stayed tough.
The strike, which was announced at the end of November, will now be carried out, said the head of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The playing days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, scheduled between November 29 and December 2, therefore fall out.
Sayings come from the Bible
Well over 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house were "saying words from the Bible" and "phrases from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the parish council, went on the biblical sayings after breakfast in a lecture.
"Saying words contain lifesaving notices, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several saying words with the corresponding Bible posts and explained the meaning.
She called saying like: Wooden eye is watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, an eye cast on someone who gives His Lord in sleep, his hands wash in innocence.
Several times, the speaker also advised her listeners about what the saying was.
The saint Christel Dehner took the speech from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, make blue, do something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called "bridges to the past."
Finally, a raffle was lost.
The prizes were conceded on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
One could call him the Dostoyevsky of the US.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serious.
Amazingly the kinship in the exterior: The standing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fjodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founding and apologetic of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is certainly something in his own country.
Some titles are published in Heyne Verlag, which distributes Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives.
Thick declares America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, a sense of security, and a belief in being selected.
Thick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mix of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs attached to his brain.
He has captioned, early on, that the calculators are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human from a machine, the creator of his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956; it exudes the smell of the Cold War and McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of "prä crime" is being developed here, "pre-Crime," which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like our terrifying, mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking.
"We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law at all," the authority's chief executive says.
'We snap them at us even before they can commit a violent crime '.
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, we have a criminal offender full of pesudocrime." They read time streams.
They assume that worst is happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts as the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terrorism laws and interception.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drones philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchdog itself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is turning through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only does it accept errors and victims, but it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick is, over and over again, getting closer to the truth.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A federal appeals court in the US on Thursday blocked the injunction of a judge who had called for changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program ("stop and search"), and dissuaded the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended pending an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program would be implemented for stopping and questioning individuals.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday for the required suspension.
The appeal report said the judge must be stripped of the case because it violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms to directives, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with body-worn cameras in neighbourhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were fired again after being checked by police.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded checks rose during the tenure of partisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed lawsuits that evolved into a class-action lawsuit.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police presidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe the changes would dampen police morale, but not crime; also, money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police force facing pressure after the removal of thousands of posts over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the nature of the NYPD's implementation of the controls.
Anger over verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be tried, as Umar Patek felt they should have been shot on a stand-by basis.
Patek, who was on the run for just under ten years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted people, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With penalty suspension, he could be sacked after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta's popular tourist district, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many more injured.
A guilty verdict also took place on a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as the "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a mastermind bomb maker.
The decision has raised painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation directed by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the other guy's footsteps.
"You should put him in front of a shooting squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I won't get another grandson and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was brought to the ground when, on 12 October 2002, a massive bomb exploded shortly after 11pm in a small lawn parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber caused an explosive-filled backpack to explode.
He fell into the coma after the attack for a month and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
Leaving him alive - no, there's no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually picked up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand up," Corteen said.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being commemorated in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his ruling.
Late-night plebiscite around Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US late-night meeting around Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives from the German federal attorney's office could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, Interfax reported.
Previously, Greens federal MP Hans-Christian Ströbele had yesterday been the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
Leg almost chopped off: Re-enactment of rocker trial
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is being rekindled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent about the takeoff.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and were among the bandidos at the time.
Prosecutors accuse them of stabbing and beating three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man would almost have lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was apparently preceded by a pursuit hunt involving several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about Revierkämpfe and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in an initial trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time it had not been proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had been wearing masks and had not been spotted.
The Federal Court upheld the ruling after reviewing the prosecutor's office and referred it to the District Court for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
To kick off, it was mainly a matter of reconstructing the processes on Tatnacht.
As a witness, the commissioner at the time was charged.
At the centre were mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who the police had intercepted.
What is difficult is that rockers in court almost always abide by a law they marry - and do not rule out.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had packed out.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand there had been new footage emerging since the latest trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
Pamela Anderson separates herself from her legendary blonde locks and emerges with new bubihead for the first time.
Pamela's blonde locks have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated herself from her long blonde locks in favour of a platinum blonde shorthair cut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look in Los Angeles on Wednesday and also posted a snapshot to her Twitter page right now.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the sittsame change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

The number of people without a job dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the 3.1% quota is better than last year and better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy managing director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have few skilled workers in craft, healthcare and care for the elderly."
Since September, due to the period of the year, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector have been launched again.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt from 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Traffic light on permanent red: On wait eighth
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loophole in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What to do then - driving at red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue, stated Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the journal "Motorrad."
However, the waiting time must be "reasonable," which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to stay out for at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the traffic lights.
Those who continue the journey despite red lights, however, must be aware that they are fully to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns, pointing to a decision by the Upper Country Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light breach.
After all, the traffic lights were not defective, but they jumped onto green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Profit losses at Bombardier after fall in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after it was pressured by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the rail division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also released no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information on whether the plane could go into commercial use under the ambitious schedule next September.
Only three more launches followed on the test aircraft's maiden flight a month and a half ago, which makes it doubtful whether the test phase will proceed as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a price crash of more than eight per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its valuation from "outperform" to "sector perform" with a view to allowing the share to have limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery numbers were widely expected on aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
If, however, no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as prospective buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet are accurate.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground for longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's standoff.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a reworking period, as we did.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft are expected to launch in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, company sources said.
Still, analysts remain skeptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can board a CSeries plane.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it over the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test - even if they obviously correspond to BOMBARDIERS internal planning - reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, BOMBARDIERS net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million and 9 cents per share a year earlier.
Adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales gave up slightly and fell from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decline from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Aerospace sales fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, announced that sales in that division rose by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport division was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by handling problems with some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares surged 8.5 percent and were down 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google finance chief Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and BOMBARDIERS closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers must also continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations on such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement which US airlines have to do vast amounts of work, but are not pursuing any immediate plans to amend their regulations.
Aviation regulator CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it was reported.
The issue is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying it is open to change, but these would have to be initiated by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesman said.
Qantas said that the current rules will remain in place until further notice.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices may not be used during launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and I am sure that we will take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs, and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases at poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be dumped safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats at launch and landing.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga's outward game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is calling for a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old is hoping to have his best goalkeeper with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to dispense with the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Nice animals and delicious cakes loving
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour beats will present the district association performance show at the Bürgerhaus this weekend.
The reviews were made as early as Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the county of Soest show their best animals as well as young breeders hobby-keepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges carried out the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to draw outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show will be well informed as the assessment of all animals is appropriate on the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition takes Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The canine show is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. on Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. on Sunday.
Guests are also invited to a raffle filled with stately material prizes and to a delicious cafeteria.
Serious injuries after collision
On state Road 44 near Revensdorf early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a frontal collision.
Police immediately shut down the road completely but were able to say little about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf approached her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles jumped together, with the woman so heavy-handed that the fire department needed just under half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wrack.
The actual cause of the accident remained unresolved at first.
Both of those injured came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully locked for about two hours.
British police issue an extradition notice to Assange
British police today handed over an extradition decree to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a "call to stand up," urging him to appear in a police station, and added he should not comply with that, threatening him arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on charges in a sex offence after his options were exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "sent a call to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we chose," a spokesman explained.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy gave no comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and indicted there on possible spying charges after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the revelation website WikiLeaks.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will provide two religious services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life," which impressed viewers this spring, the Liederkranz will enrich two religious services with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Fair at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be held from 19: 00 onwards during the evening fair in St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October, from 10.15: 00 at the church service in St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heil Opfer der Messe," D 872, is a spiritual piece of music by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its emergence.
The exhibition will be performed within the framework of the services of God, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's swing is linked to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail wept more to the right (from the dog's point of view) while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain halves respond differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swing of their species, researchers monitored the animals while watching other dogs "films.
They measured the heart rate of the quadriceps and analyzed the behaviour.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise pressure-free dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the weeping dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tense was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that wedded), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in which movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and that Wedeln is linked to the tail in one direction rather with friendly behaviour and the right side produces more of a less friendly behaviour, then you react on the basis of those experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, vets and trainers to better understand their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behaviour and guest stipendiate at the Faculty of Animal Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important to dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: "Dogs tend to go to a robot dog when his, tail" left wedded and not right, rather than becoming restless - exactly the other way around than in the Italian study. "
According to his statement, the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
Since their behaviour is easy to record, it probably won't be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his leaving office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking out on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East.
Asked whether he would like to return to the prime minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that that will happen, so..."
Housing fire in Helmbrecht: Rescue workers hide charred corpse
The fire department had to pull out in Helmbrecht late Thursday night.
A DREIFAMILIENHAUS in the district of Hof catches fire at night to Friday.
Rescue workers hide a charred corpse from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred corpse in a DREIFAMILIENHAUS during a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether it would handle a resident was still unclear, a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
By late Thursday evening, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already running out of a window.
The deployments went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room.
This and another room burst out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the Brands, the police spokesman explained.
The building was no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Constance: Cyclist drives 63-year-old around
The accident had happened, according to police, when a 26-year-old man was riding irregular on the left sidewalk from Bahnhofplatz towards the market site at about 10pm on Thursday evening.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped onto the sidewalk from a local, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went further to the ground and moved to the head for a 15 centimetre long space lap.
A rescue crew brought the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.

UN announces new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations is now embarking on a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty, which were announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals expiring in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals. "
Özdemir wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the Music High Schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir told the "Stuttgart News."
Jazz and classical are just together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
In doing so, Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered the favourite for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is pushing for a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, among other things, the study course Jazz and Pop will be moved from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
Pfandhäuser booming in Singapore as middle-class crisis arrives
At a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanged a golden arm rifle, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters "school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also worked, monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, in parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is growing - demand is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third Pfandhaus listed on the Singapursian Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money - $1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäuser in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, Pfandhäuser offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than for banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhäuser after families feel the pressure from rising costs of living, as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, lower and middle-income families are looking to deposit houses to make up the difference in stotting economies.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, called it a risk factor for the credit rating of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product, according to the agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, with 80% of GDP, a 60% increase in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued export weakness and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"In effect, in the face of rising costs, this means that people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge personal items as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city's 200 Pfandhäuser are gold.
People say to themselves: "The price of gold looks good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, easymoney, has seen 20 percent customer growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four homes - but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of ValueMax.
The company is funding that with 60 per cent of Singapore's $66 million, which it took up this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders were caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser not only offered more favorable interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise debt.
"Customers insult items they already own, and the constitutional personal value item does not increase household debt," she explains.
The bond business is increasingly accepted as short-term, hedged financing.
Also, not all people who use Pfandleihe are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 per cent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," Yeah says.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick shacks for patrons: Mane no swallow
However satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" showed disappointment from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the swallow royal category," he took the two offensive wirbler into protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese became an alleged acting offender - which, of course, was none, as the TV images showed.
"A stark misjudgement," said Rangnick, who referee Harkam described as "utterly overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Val Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot: "There I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended," the 46-year-old stressed.
Given the course of success, though, Rangnick matched a lobe anthem.
"There are only two words for that: Right good," he noted.
There's not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
This is to continue in a calm manner.
There will hardly be any change in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player stepping in with the desire that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
A study has been announced by the UK government aimed at increasing the benefits of the hs2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of hs2 Ltd proposes to implement high-speed rail links between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the UK government on the plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Nordengland from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed hs2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Nordengland and Scotland.
These include the possibility of a travel period of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our target for hs2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We go ahead with hs2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improving thanks to hs2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to be "unequivocal" in campaigning for Scottish involvement in the hs2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic strength is also delivering an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the UK government and explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with UK ministers next year and jointly deciding the next steps.
Live with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, old trees, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spiders?" Asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider at the door frame.
I have been searching for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, though, is not spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many staircases to the house and apartment at the age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to experience on their own what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
Only recently has a book been published by her on the subject of 'Happy living in old age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our flat is the best example of what doesn't go on in old age, 'she begins to tell.
When she moved into the maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful flat in the middle of the greenery.
Today with mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people to deal with the issue of 'living in old age' in the first place.
Most squeeze it out as long as it goes.
Old are always just the others', she says schmunzelnd.
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really great that one thinks.
'so it may be too late, 'says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer introduces 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
'whichever form of living you choose is always an individual choice, 'she explains.
D i e solution do not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the age ruhesitz in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also become ill.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, you also unite in the Dolce Vita,' gives the author of the book to consider settlers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
In old age, everyone so has their ticks and macs
'for me, such a housing community would be nothing ', she reckons with an eye-popping twist.
Certainly not like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'in old age you just need your retreat rooms too, 'says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior residential community can still function.
But that would have to be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace of mind, 'she believes.
With this view, at least in the national capital, it is not alone.
'most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Civil Service life at the age of the state capital.
Her department advises people around the topic of 'becoming elderly'.
That is why older people would often accept inconvenience and restrictions only to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone who deals with the age-appropriate reconstruction of their home or home should first get in-depth information and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, one thing or another can be realized, and if it's just the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
However, it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment in accordance with age and therefore without barriers, even if it is still so beautiful.
That experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the road paved with stairs up to the door of the apartment would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it grinned her more than before the spider at her apartment door.
NSA sues data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants help
The secret service reveler Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany to clear up the increasingly brisk NSA spawn.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Greens-German parliament, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence staff would testify at a German prosecutor's office or in front of a committee of inquiry.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine, "Panorama."
Motorists seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old man was driving out of rubbish about 9.15pm with her car on the Kempener outside ring towards Grefrath.
When they wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, they oversaw the 37-year-old's oncoming car.
The driving fences collided.
The axe suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
After six days of playing, TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league.
Right now it's coming for the Ingo Ehlers team tomorrow to the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first win last weekend.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," admits Ehlers behaving optimistically.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete cadre at his disposal.
Daverden, too, relies like we do on tempo play.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has, at the end of the day, left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after his first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're far from the favourite, because anything can always happen in the Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to indulge in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this reason, the A-Youth youngster Joost Windßuss, who is active in the A-Youth Bundesligisten HC Bremen with double-play rights, is celebrating his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough further
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpooler Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation for fear his secret drug addiction could be revealed has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his activities in the drug trade after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, hailed by criminalists as "first-class," nicknamed "Bash" was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched as Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while this one was with colleagues at a meal held by the attorney general.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine as well as £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today Ditta, who works for law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpooler Crown Court following a three-week trial on two charges of obstruction of justice.
He admitted cocaine possession during an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and watched him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf handgun under the lawyer's garbage bin.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then exchanged nine communications between the two.
In court it became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests found Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but declined to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because that was his client, claiming their discussion was subject to "attorney secrecy."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, yet they were secured and he was taken off a hair sample.
At police interrogation, he indicated that he was running an office under his private address as well as in the workplace, and clients would call him home because of legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal justice lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender as he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but of a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of those individuals.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities.
In doing so, Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing by himself, claiming: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I wouldn't wait 15 hours but do that immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment he began acquiring drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise, making him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to squeeze behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also resulted in a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial impairment, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabishantrade.
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, stating that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and that inequality was the motivation for his work.
Until now, the police inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to raise children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and removed the egg residue at the same time, no material damage is likely to have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were probably lit in the city area, but there was no material damage here either.
A local resident in the Bishop's Friendship Path reported that his car was wrapped with closet paper and his wheelchair faded.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man found out all his flashes of cyclists in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to act.
A day of gratitude at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV had invited "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
At the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate strength to make honours.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted to receive the special award "singer of the year."
"Not only have you written a lot for us, but you have also made many rounds for us, for which our sincere thanks," says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals were awarded to Dieter Schulze, the choral director, with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman, Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler, with 42 participants each.
Artur Brückner ranked fifth.
A special thanks were given by the Board to the team of Vereinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again conjured up an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the club's local restaurant.
"New symphonic voices are always welcome to us," says Schlotmann.
Council takes down rail facilities
Is the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" to be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach will have to put EUR 220 000 in charge of this.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to contribute a third to the cost, and the rest will share the railways and covenants.
Schiltach's mayor Roland Grießhaber explained to the local council the peculiarities of the Bahübergang "Am Hirschen."
There, the city plans to build a funicular at the height of the tunnel to the west of the railway tracks.
There, larger vehicles, such as those transporting langholz, could also be on counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greeks therefore proposed constructing a required support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the local council as some councils cast doubt on the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, brought the mood of critics to the point: "Do we have to put so much money into it because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas refuted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is regularly used for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" will be transported in part via this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route served as a redirection for those vehicles not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
As we can see, Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am" Hirschen "could also have important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
Councils agreed to investigate what costs the planned widening of the road would incur.
Despite this, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the provision that the necessary support wall would be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to around 5.5 metres.
Converting the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a very different problem, which affects access to the soaring "Geroltzhäuser Weg."
The administration had let the railway's conversion plans be examined by the Breinlinger engineering office as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus route would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out that the road's inclination could cause longer vehicles to sit up.
In turn, responsibility for this lies with the city as a road-building truck carrier.
The conversion can therefore lead to disputes of liability.
Since both the wood extraction and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway transition, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because it is directly adjacent to the centre, to which there is a good visibility connection.
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be slowed down to the point where there was no threat of a collision.
A majority were refused consent to the conversion of this railway crossing, as the town of Schiltach would have to "bathe out" the problem with residing vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The Board considers the reconstructions at the railway crossings "vor Heubach" and "vor Kuhbach," for which cross-border agreements with the railway have already been reached, to be unproblematic.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new gas artery
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Executive Board said.
"Today's event is a milestone: Construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller, said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is supposed to provide greater diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is stored for Europe, poses an increased risk of conventional routes, as officials say.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" ripped off.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other secondary countries is due to begin on the planned route towards the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Vienna Airport kicks off passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Breakthroughs like these will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
As a result, a large proportion of the loudspeaker passes away - the noise level is thus to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of breakthroughs affecting individuals.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning the noisy calls.
Due to the removal of these announcements - on average around 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers in one day - the airport is expected to be calmer in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual breakthroughs were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed airfares or departure times here a little undergo a bit," Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Barely a hundred years ago, varieteartist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd straight jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays's innovation has been expanded, as it was most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year's festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and major theaters.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became increasingly successful until they were eventually too known to perform at a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy benchmark event for army evaders at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians attending the festival this year have become aware of more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was announced with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically conclusive fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian but has become a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me if he's here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
On the last weekend of August the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous co-actions and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release states.
Whether it's making soap, turning candles, filtering or making ropes, for any age the passage is included.
The children are supported by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
There is also a museum workshop.
During the construction of cuckoo furnaces, waterbikes or circulars, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun is promised by the many old games, such as thrust-carts races or stallions running.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the small detectives, the open-air museum offers a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, each at 12 and 2 p.m.
On a change of course, children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are lying.
In addition, visitors have a special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage trip with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be seen and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children on Sunday can look forward to the clown Otsch pushing his shabernack at 11am with museum guests.
Hermann Büttner, meanwhile, is cosy and fairy-tale.
The storyteller takes the small guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's training group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both events from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the näherin, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are waiting for a varied holiday programme.
Networking of colleges and firms important
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, the country's president, Guido Wolf, was also able to explain in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow are coming from.
At the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the chairman of the parent advisory board, he looked into this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, which presented the interconnected High Black Forest school project.
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Support Centre, Kreisgymnasium and Vocational Training Centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
"It's important not only to have the family phase in view, but because of demographic change also the phase around caring for loved ones," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled labour, he said further.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, are often preserved to the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the country's president was convinced.
After all, it is only by providing sufficient training places that the need for skilled workers can be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in south-west Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
"Stay persistent and make sure that public transport gets better," he explained to local leaders present.
Australian lays appeal against jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the ruling and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men tied her up.
Later, however, footage from a video footage showed she had entered her hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having thought out the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rubgy league player who has reached out to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted to have her back in Australia.
"We are obviously very worried, but we hope she is back at home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is at large against a £50,000 Baht bail.
Australian reports have read that she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand in the meantime.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, following the recent assassination of Michelle Smith, in Phuket, may be seeking to improve its battered tourist image, which is why it is acquitting itself.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has decorated the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleansed and spread the footage, it says in a news release.
The planned cover of the collapsed house in the rear of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the site is in danger of being demolished.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had canceled the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the BI's action, a banner with the message "We are for this" had been attached.
However, this did little to disrupt the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins."
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "construction site," it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will improve for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying those answers, the BI says.
As was heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the local council meeting that he feared the demise of the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow when the citizens vote.
Some therefore seem downright frightened, others perceive it as a "crude attempt at blackmail" on the population, according to the press release from the BI.
The BI thanked donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria had destroyed key facilities for producing chemical weapons and grid gas munitions, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began soon three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline on
November 1, which the Hague-based organization had set up Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all facilities for producing chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying its existing weapons and stockpiles.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts say is where there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as storage facilities, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the number of dead across a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army figures and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in the conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
That number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide details.
The fighting underscores the danger that chemical weapons inspectors face, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time amid a towering civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction."
That is why 'no further inspection activities are currently planned'.
Earlier in the week, inspectors had said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, the visit of two facilities would not have been possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned, according to Syrian testimony... and that the chemical weapons program's objects there had been relocated to other named facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by OPWC's executive committee next month.
"I pull the hat off the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," Ahmed Uzumcu, the monitoring organization's director general, explained in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a secession from Shia Islam in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites.
Regarding further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
RBS suspends two currency traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rising rapidly.
Some of the world's biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with authorities on investigations into the world's largest financial market, on which 5.3 billiards of U.S. dollars switch the owner daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the widening investigation, which follows the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which gave no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation into this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation announced that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
That retailer, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been retired from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was retired this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency retailer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator FINMA said it was seeking alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority WeKo, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are alleged to have agreed to transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are cracking instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been among the most profitable of investment banks "trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading retailer noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to "you being able to influence the market even with very low ticket prices."
The news came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had cancelled a retailer of its London Exchange traded funds office this week after causing a loss of just under $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are sure the retailer acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse explained.
Coulson set phone hacking for checking a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and pursued them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
"According to the prosecutor's office, Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of the flat of people and hoping to tap into them for fresh action, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW use three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: Phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say: "And whether he knew about it."
Rumours of a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial board when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles together."
A band with voicemails from their phone on at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister had been stored as "projects."
By the time the searches were going on, Pawlby's grandparents were receiving anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk about with Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities on this story followed the same pattern as on other major figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he himself had been likened to fellow accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having swore with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted phone hacking.
Early puberty: Getting grown faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age genosines, research shows.
Physical changes don't mean puberty right now
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter is already growing breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the Children's Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - normally that's not an indication that puberty is now fast entering," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, shaming and artery hair as well as body smell, show up in girls earlier.
Yet there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first rule bleeding) over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it still takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential counselor for dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is progressing.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "early ripe" for breast enlargement to be accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests could be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and defying another consequence: Premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth impairment and therefore small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about medication, but he admits: "Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike being their age genosines."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry because of pregnancy risk or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days off with ten.
Even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Young come into puberty similar to girls earlier in the day.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, which established a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age genosines.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have been growing facial and shamelessness before, the trend towards full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shaming hair is common even among babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"That can mean having a conversation sooner than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who thrive early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires attendees
In splendid weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to handle the circular course across the hill chains around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, were numerous everyone who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two top-class junior riders from Germany were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came up with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
The two were expected to be removed from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader saved a small time ahead of goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In place of two, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning treble.
At number two and three, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years old at the youngest to over 70 at the oldest starters.
In the main standings, even more absolute top athletes were at the launch this year.
Four drivers were able to get away from the regional top drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, along with a teammate, had already twice been world champion in the 12-hour drive.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, a WimpernSchlagfinale arrived in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl raced first over the finish line.
Only a second behind, the Routinier Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came into the target as third parties to the overall valuation.
Christiane Cohsmann was in the lead in the women's standings.
Areane Blersch from Binzwgen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well organised running of the event.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter planes would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target had been, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB supporters with luminous trakeouts had made for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before Friday's match of the Football Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - at first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost spirited acoustics that offered the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesligaspiel between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
It was mostly the guest fans with their vocals that were heard.
The South Tribune, by contrast, where the fairest of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented themselves exceptionally quietly: No singing, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common moisture, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the gallery a large flag with the inscription "section of the stadium ban."
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, short-term cheers burst up.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and weeping scarves - but far from everywhere.
Nothing rained in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also, that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel recounted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbyvictory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for holiday lads.
Just five minutes before the kick-off, the Capo smashed his podium - and, until then, the one with his hands of tangible tension unraveled in a loud cry, when Dickel asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
As always, it was the turn of the South Tribune - and finally here again as usual was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when with Anpfiff from the South Tribune the loud call "Derbywinner stands up" came, everything was again as usual.
The silence before that was probably a reaction to what has happened over the past few days.
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the most enthusiastic BVB supporters had fired light trakeepers into the spectators and onto the pitch - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was belatedly whipped up because of the chaotic scenes.
BvB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had subsequently received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uneasy appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultramovement," the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday night.
As an immediate measure, Watzke understated to the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"That's what I've banned," he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
Moreover, the Ultras have been given various means of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to opt for one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
"That will be sweeping," Watzke assured.
We should be interested to see what the reaction in the South Tribune will be.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to traditional mail, has the letter secrecy been technically implemented?
In the conception of early Internet services, the emphasis was on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, no effort has been made to establish a stable foundation for a radio-safe exchange of letters.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni," are the computers of the two then directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser will send the mail to her service provider's mail server in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the track, the mail can run via a number of other servers on the internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an appendix.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have yet another task?
In systems like GMail, the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails with?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading a mail is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal options to intercept or take note of emails.
There is also the possibility of illegal postponement.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against co-reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo Mail's shares had last fallen, GMail was able to make clear from Google.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible peasant shortage: The Evangelisch-Lutheran provincial church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030, according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the course of the day itself.
With Burfien, the provincial church for the first time instructed a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for the theologian estudium.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributed this to the process of dechurch: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to humans as a sedative.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well off it.
Of course, more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a secure employer for it.
That comes against today's young people, who are not just about careers, but about a sinner-filled job.
According to the state church, which covers three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors currently retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theological profession begin their Vikariat.
In the future, in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin, Emsland or Wendland, it could be difficult to fill positions.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The Theologiestudium offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Hearing before Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of sex offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with child sex offences before charges were brought against child care provider Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission into Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
But in the opening statement before the commission, the YMCA had stated that "one in the organisation had never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse."
Managing director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with offences involving child pornography and another in which a sports instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the commission's assisting lawyers, that he had known of the first case but had not known the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the commission instead shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had "failed to step down from me" in hiring Lord and did not ensure staff had been aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sex offences against 12 boys during his two-year tenure for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented staff from reporting Lords breaches in relation to child safety.
Staff said they had observed breaches, including that Lord was alone with children, looked after them privately as babysitters, let them sit on his lap, said to one he loved, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said the child services chief Jacqui Barnat, who was the superiority Lords at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and very unassuming most of the time."
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare said he told the board of YMCA NSW his view was that the lesson the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not the meltdown" by staff, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge staff to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations appeared was made by the YMCA's managing director of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said this was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, but which had been "over-zealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a safe organisation for children in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, reviewing, engaging, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 metres in length below Cologne, a sewage channel from the Roman period has been preserved.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass the Cathedral.
About 157 metres up the two towers into the sky, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral, too.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We're catching up in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the Seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, which is why the remains of the old city wall remained just what was not too big.
Most of the users of the car park pass by the remains of the Roman Empire and leave their cars alone.
But if you look more closely, an archaeological site separated by metal grid roofs is discovered in the parking deck D2.
Some five-metre-high ruins of hand-made stones can be seen.
"These are remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," Schulze tells.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets participants take a look at a sinister 15-metre deep shaft at the upper parking level.
This is the fountain of the old Cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed either.
Next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants descend back down into the deep.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the precursor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, "which in good German means as much as" City of Roman Law and City of Agrippine, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the Imperial cult. "
And the Pretorium is the former statue palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you like," Schulze encourages guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After picking up the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels are readable by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on Town Hall Square for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
However, it will be a few years before completion.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free press system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers coming to bowlers have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an achievable path to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strains and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - that's going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February at the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story on independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland was needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
That provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along the Hadrian wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a part in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has come in such a way in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I've heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance according to the European pipe?
Why swap the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: The grand post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany - founded only this year - was able to secure nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, effectively expelling Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is turning out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket into which the national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters - and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending - boosted by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage caps do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is gathering, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, which is causing the troubled French economy to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election, putting the ruling Socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the popular vote - a timely warning for Britain's Labour Party that it cannot assume a split on the right would automatically mean benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among white working-class French?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay on all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in final consequence) Klein-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can get stuck in.
I suspect Scotland could fare very well in a looser European composite, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same for Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and pre-approved) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition had to blame.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to be forced into austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (but don't make mobile calls)
Air passengers can now, from departure to landing, use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but don't phone with the cellphone, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented hinge on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew's training manuals and the rules on stocking the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among those airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers will have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors close.
They will not be allowed to restart them until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn it off again and not restart it before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes were secured against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the devices even at launch, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other fliers that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at greater heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendants' association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is safely implemented - and we are working closely with the airline in this regard - both sides will benefit," Glading commented.
To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like passers-by on this issue.
However, internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained banned, the authority explained.
Passengers are urged to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to publicly leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be dusted, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain banned.
The regulatory competence for phone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA suspends possible ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, security expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, said cellphones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitter masts," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the device's shutdown.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communications devices by passenger-led UKW radios that represented the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that electronic interference does not make them anything.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for a number of years when flight height is reached.
The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally produce significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give out minimal radiation when you're fumbling.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Advocates of easing restrictions on device use by passengers include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not identify any.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the disruption caused by the devices was genuine, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only single reports of pilots pretending to disrupt aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA that pilots should be allowed to arrange for passengers to switch off the equipment during instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for travellers who would now be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo," the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important for the ham are the pig trays, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces to Black Forest ham
Only with hair protection and Kittel he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo, too, must first disinfect his hands before being allowed to grab the micro.
Jumbo for reinforcement at Schnellimbiss in Waldshut secured
"Here I am worked on smelly quantities," amazes the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 culls a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months to go.
Television with level?
Details such as the ph value of the flesh also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"There I am excited when you see Roberto Blanco meshing what happens then," Jumbo cynically said.
Here, the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worth watching anyway.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the culls continues to be hand-crafted.
Because Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "submarine."
The trick: Tanning branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc is disappearing in the jumbo," he announces test-speeding.
"Der ist richtig lecker," says the TV star's conclusion.
Everyone involved will be able to live with this.
Freudenstadt: Quick action overshrinks host
With a narrow cadaver, the men's I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the Freudenstädter, also due to age.
With the hard and placed upsets, the Gönninger did extremely hard.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were out of place in the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all matters.
In the face of this crushing and game-defining performance, the third set was won somewhat lightly and lustlessly to the 3: 0 final (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on 2 November with the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly prevailed in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and scores on the ball in particular; even on passes, precision was sometimes deficient, and in some critical game scenes the over-zealous prevented the glimpse of possible points gains.
In this very well-balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently matched the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment from both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The eventual decisions are made by the members of the local council."
The flooding that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, was a sweeping event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protecting as many cultivated land as possible is the goal," Häußler said.
According to the German Weather Service, the planning is based on the protection against the expected flooding every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
In specialist circles this is called "HQ 100aClimate."
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, amounted to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aClimate protection, approximately EUR 4 million will have to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect about 70 percent state aid.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the promotion only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
In order to do this, the community must rely on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
At its best, 2016 could begin implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented to the local council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm river from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to introduce their concerns.
Among other things, it questioned why more dams and restraint basins were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the contracted engineering firm Wald and Corbe aus Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is important to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Displeasure reigned among residents of the old town, who, even with normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from overcrowding on the canal network.
The problem is well known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three-year-olds could cope with regeneration events.
Expanding the sewage channels would devastate millions.
The redesigned Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the event of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure déjà vu feeling.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has precisely this goal: To make a real stay not only imaginative, but also handsome, recurring experience.
Because it's just fun and just beautiful.
A look inside at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
With the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top, the team spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually priced fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the smart cafe at the Opschlag as a gastronaut: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge."
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the sympathetic café-lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least through college.
"While we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stresses.
Rather, the two here want to address young students in the same way as seniors and all ages in between.
Apropos cafe lovers.
The sympathetic bearer couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot tanning in a variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino-Trinkerin.
"To that's a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
Two events were already taking place in the bright café.
Better said one thing.
The harbor festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not profit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Beautiful, successful and witty," found the two 33-year-olds.
But just not everyone's thing.
Perhaps this is not why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event-evenings: "You can't get it right."
And with one event I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events are more likely to be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
Let's say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomic part.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and therefore also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

Jumbo makers dispute in face of big orders over seat width
Clashes have erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those that airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch rival Boeing says that should decide the airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft makers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from November 17-21.
How the rear part of the aircraft is shaped - particularly whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is crucial to the stated economic results to deliver the new "mini jumbo" design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" façade will allow 406 people in seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and so ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share hovering over technical details via advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title: "Would you accept this?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
Given changed dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept when the average body size of the freshly baptized "jet set" was narrower.
Research has been carried out, according to Airbus, showing that additional inches (2.54 cm) per seat increase sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat sizes and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between airline fares and facilities.
The company also explains, according to research, the experience in the plane hangs from more than the seat width.
"It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders worth at least $700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper air fares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: From an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is controlled by the threat posed by the 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert in cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-beating jet sellers even carry bandmeasure to gauge the equipment at the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering a ten-seat A350 but, according to its own statement, has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to puff but could distract from the wave of 77X sales.
According to Lexika, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it is very different from that.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream varieties, ice cream or a vigorous edam, these delicacies are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan departs from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may be wondering, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local Reform House, which supplies a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealand vegan has lived in Lampertheim, where he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I switched my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal.
He realized that it's also going on in other everyday concerns without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is his one ethics.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor exclaims the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumption patterns.
Instead of mourning burgers, scramblers or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, and enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "actually represents vegan's no waiver, not Askese, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with the dietary conversion you reduce your choice of menu options, Proctor is more likely to attribute it to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditionalities that have failed some more well-intentioned attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many quickly give up, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And applies: "Certain tastes are not to be fixed on the animal."
Often it's the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
Proctor brings, for example, aubergines, champignons and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue festival.
It takes care of a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste flavorful for once.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage, right up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption he had not suffered.
For me, the conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased amount of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are excellent, I often get cheated," Proctor quipped.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warns many vegansim critics.
"As animals are fed with feed rather than grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 portion is high," Proctor finds.
For vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor would not have to go a long way in obtaining food.
After all, basic foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the ground.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what is known as" ordinary "finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than usual.
"In the home kitchen there's a lot to discover, with a few small knees you can get good if not partially better results," Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and cabbage instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cakes, Proctor could also make his son-in-law wonder.
Family feasts give the vegan a new seasoning.
This has a new meaning when you cook together.
"The situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, he has also been skeptical.
Do you no longer taste my food?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - for such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a sense of finger.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to freeze an enclave.
And, more specifically, the everyday world does not seem as vegan-alien as might have been assumed - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is allowed, too.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dönerläden offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he softens out on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are getting up to it so slowly.
"When I started feeding myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was a lot harder," the New Zealand native can find out a development: "You have to talk to people, alert them to it."
"If enough enquiries come in, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hears the desire that other restaurants, too, have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're just the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and quite literally, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also contain in peanuts as colourers, one seems to quickly abandon courage by adhering to the ethics of so many hurdles and traps.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are attached to food and cleaning products.
"Gradually one develops a scanner view and knows which signs and logos one has to pay attention to," It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stumble, "" Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger-pointing that beats to consciousness.
He may not quite succeed in dropping his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
Bavarian basketballer optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among FC Bayern Munich's basketball players.
"Nobody can forbid us from believing in winning even against Europe's best team of the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) win over title contenders Olympiakos Piräus on Thursday night.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their third appearance in the European royal class, Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not cleared enough at the decisive stages.
The guests initially managed the piece of art to convert a 15-point backhand 13 minutes before finishing in a lead before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion but then again made reckless mistakes," Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were Munich's most successful scorers, celebrating clear victories in the first two matches against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title-winner Zielona Góra.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put a stop to pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More trials are needed before testing on humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered to include genetic information to make nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infected the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, leaving a smoker unable to experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal levels of activity.
Mice without vaccination, by contrast, would have taken a "time out," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody perfabrics.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if it was quite certain, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, though, smokers would use it to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them put off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but warned at the same time that further research was needed.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary detail, but it is also heavier than necessary.
The plot, played in France in the 1760s, tells the stunning story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic Oberin and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never glides into likeness or sensationalism - and therein lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a tortuous buffoon for the audience.
Egypt sworn first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi leaves office, but his Day of Triumph is unlikely to spell the end of Egypt's political disputes.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, implying the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He placed the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is embroidered to an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremonial ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been mostly targeted as a banned organization by the respective government since it was founded 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered at the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential prunk from the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Mocked as an uncharismatic "spare wheel" by the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as an Islamist candidate but to all those who wanted to bring the 2011 uprising's aspirations against the authoritarian Mubarak to an end.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," the Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he filed the oath of office.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was due to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chaplain who played the national anthem, which he listened to in belongings.
The military leader field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest hearing room with chants of "The army and the people are a hand."
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi laid a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the head of state who had been driven out of office.
But by laying the official oaths before the court, rather than the parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing association.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the well-known choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral reference on behalf of the Caesar Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate from the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singers handed him the certificate of the German Choral Association as well as an engraved tin teller.
In addition to the honour, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in usual ways: With the MGV betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music club, the Full Maringer had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and singing styles that entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, her brothers."
Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied."
The men's singing association betra also sang classical choral songs such as "JägerWerbung" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley."
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulse chorus" - the Liederkranz Salzstetten ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folk "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulse chorus" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers "department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to the local Gefilde with" What's the Schwob? "By Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's" Bierlied, "where the Full Maringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side programme - "grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children worked well at lunchtime.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who wish to dump hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers were likely to keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it calculated $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid first at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at getting travelers to take care of the payment beforehand.
"We don't want to charge this sum," she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second items of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore plunged into hand baggage as much as possible, with the result that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way of getting passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about Frontier's most loyal customers, who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge at the entrance of Frontier, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they would get to the boarding gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage charge does not come into effect until the summer, an exact date is not yet in place.
Passengers often chime in on baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the luggage should cost money and passengers should pay for that service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far dropped fingers on hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first demanded carry-on baggage charges three years ago, and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand baggage fee would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to hold a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the boarding school if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage charge.
"The boarding process was among the most smooth I have seen in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth knighthood and handsome discussions at the boarding school.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding ran like smithy."
Frontier also follows Spirit at the $2 fee required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were likely to keep the whole can and replenish coffee for free.
Water remains free.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but reversed it seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company moved in.
Frontiers step up fees for hand luggage when passengers don't buy directly from the airline, the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agents such as orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to get passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were cut again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
For this reason, a flight with a frontier over 1000 miles booked by a third-party provider will only take customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, yet the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined 9 percent and flight capacity shrank just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get a grip on Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, students from the Black Forest gymnasium met the American big city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight off to the Brooklyn Bridge, via which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
By the time the students were on their feet for nearly 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached on the second day with a ferry and heard on foot.
It then went via the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial on September 11.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Buildings, while enjoying the view.
It then went through the hectic hustle and bustle of New York's streets over Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have now arrived in their host families and are experiencing day-to-day school life at Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors there is no way past the real estate site of Germany.
The economic framework data are right, and the funding options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the economic conditions in the country that are good in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the Börsen newspaper.
As sought-after German commercial properties show, look at the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
It surged 31% in the first three quarters of this year compared to the same period last year.
In the United Kingdom, the plus was only 6%, and in France it was 19%.
"Property investments offer an attractive rate of interest," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at historically high levels.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose corpse was found in a collapsed rifle in the gym of his high school, are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found in a sustained mat behind the grandstand in the school turnroom on January 11.
Investigators from the sheriff's office of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but questioned the family of the 17-year-old.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Cthem, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed he had died as the sheriff shouted.
"They believe that it defies any logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense," says Cthem.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is concealed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"Her son went to school for learning and came back in the lightsaber bag," he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of key issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death down to a crime?
That's what Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I take the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of "positional suffocation."
A second autopsy did, however, result in another cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will charge the FBI with conducting the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not immediately available for comment at our request Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.

John Kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has gone "inappropriately too far"
With an unexpected admission, John Kerry indicated a softening of the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had gone "inappropriately too far" in certain cases.
The foreign minister also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for having switched to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leaked information has led the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a videotaped speech at the London Open Government Conference, Kerry said: "Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some of the things that have happened, almost by autopilot, simply because there was the capacity to do so, which dates back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 11 September."
He then admitted, as the first high-ranking member of the US government, that US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases this has gone unreasonably far."
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be compromised.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world where people are prepared to blow themselves up in the air."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is reconciling on killing people, jumping into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans beforehand.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in anti-terrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, explained in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents circulated by Snowden that the NSA had monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the espionage at allies as necessary, saying this was common practice on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the trip of Congress to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MPs are due to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also spoke out that there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments would have to be honest to their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also reconcile themselves with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spiing," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry faces a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to address the grievance over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities there.
Children's dreams come true
The nursery schools and nurseries in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail in these days.
The Black Forest Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, would like to support the facilities in realising their construction and decoration wishes.
Does the nursery need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, nurseries and crèches from all over the Customs ernal circle can participate in the event.
If you have a construction or decoration request for your equipment, you can apply with this one at the Black Forest Boots.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb chooses three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction materials worth a maximum of EUR 2000 and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide a lot of hard-working builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the nursery on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit.
The mining magnate, who is in a court battle over paying $6 million in carbon tax, questioned the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table about whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important to deciding whether to scrap or cut CO2- and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission declared Palmer with a 53-vote lead after the recount officially became the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat.
Palmer called for an overhaul of the voting counting process so that it could proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where we invade, enter the data into a computer, select it immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can then radiate the results if you don't like them?
Voting with pencils nowadays is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about public service.
"We are not seeking any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve at a critical time in this community," he said.
ESA decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch over the next few years.
30 proposals were up for selection, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are, at least on some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or to search Earth-like planets and perhaps discover alien life?
These are the questions that the leaders of the European Space Agency, Esa, are asking themselves.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to significantly advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about EUR 1 billion each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now come into closer choice.
Numerous bodies review the proposals and follow up on them with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, initiated in 2007, should find answers.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets circling these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star possesses planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To address this issue, 2017 is to launch the space telescope "Cheops," which will examine 500 already well-known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": Gases that are considered indicative of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on the conditions for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and particle radiation with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system these processes can be analysed in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter," the Esa has already approved an M-class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is due to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa foresees the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is expected to examine the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moon Europa, KALLISTO and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos emerged through the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we know about, which consists of stars, planets and living beings, there is Dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and Dark Energy, which accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy were.
With "Euclid," the Esa has already approved an M mission here too, the launch of which is scheduled for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of Dunkler's matter and Dunkler's energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection process.
The best chance of a permit as an L mission, according to many experts, has "E-Lisa," a sophisticated concept for proving gravitational waves.
By this, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not yet been proven.
Elisa could manage that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector made up of two or three probes being stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: A large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is meant to explore black holes, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" designed to detect and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals on the transport of samples back from Mars, on the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids and on solar physics have already expired.
CDC releases allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines include information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
Schools are also advised to stock Epinephrine - the EpiPen brand's auto injection is most commonly used - to counter a potentially lethal oversensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the regulations so that schools can keep Epinephrine easier to stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms referred to by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children might say, "It feels as if something is pushing on my tongue," My tongue feels as if a hair is lying on it, "or" My tongue cribbed. "
Fire brigade called to rescue a bitch that sat 15 metres above ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel bitch Ruby was off after minor road accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her dislocated condition
Firefighters seized on rock wall and rescued dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to bring a bitch to safety, which stuck on a 15-metre-high lead in a rock wall.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel bitch Ruby had gone off after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, arrived at the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to retrieve Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped after the minor road accident in the quarry.
About 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15-metre-high sale in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the site and seized to rescue Rubio, who was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 metres from the top and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff frozen.
But now it is doing well.
She subsequently eaten a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual bet.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a giant accident."
There was the possibility that she was very badly hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination but found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't even believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would presumably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: 'We were afraid she would fall down but she stayed up.'
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
U.S. border: 'Super tunnel' to drug smuggling discovered
On the Mexico-U.S. border, investigators have discovered and decommissioned a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities advised, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was fitted with electricity, railway tracks and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," U.S. District Attorney General Southern California Laura Duffy said at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a prolonged battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the building took around a year to complete.
The railway system was equipped in such a way that electric-powered cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimetres in width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was caught on camera because of the seized marijuana.
All three face life imprisonment as a maximum sentence, officials said.
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006, the news conference in San Diego continued.
However, it is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building.
Typically, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities rather than through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug-dealing DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything they could to get into the US.
No details were announced on the arrests, at least one being Mexicans, it said.
They have to face prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama Returns on Health Policy
After heavy criticism, President Obama pulled back yesterday on his frequently repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a notice of termination, Republicans warned the president in recent days that he had misled the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relented on his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies, Obama urged Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government described it as little surprise that the five per cent of the population who themselves have completed insurance would have to look for a different tariff because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans quite directly: They deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else as well," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement from a raised Sebelius to an adviser behind her at yesterday's House of Representatives hearing was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius on why the Affordable Care Act's "architect" had not voluntarily waived state-sponsored insurance to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Parents of intersex children can choose 'gender undetermined'
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but may specify "unspecified" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so they don't have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said, according to the BBC, years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sex differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that you should use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding - if at all - to have an operation.
The New York-based psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "blazes after a good thing."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, yet for most children that doesn't apply," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity in the first place is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret to why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but is due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both at the same time or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair loss, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not conform to the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australians recognised Norrie May-Welby (52) as the world's first "sexless" person after a court granted lifetime retaining an "unspecified" gender status.
German cards in addition to M and W will in future have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, on the grounds that: "If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a Maryland newborn explained to Baby Zone that she would do better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
"Parenting is already stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned to them.
"In the mid-20th century, you called that one, psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, one called not the psychiatrist but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitalia dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was formable.
He coined the term "gender identity," arguing that social and environmental impulses - like parents educating a child - interacted with a child's genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considers themselves male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John / Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during a padded circumcision, to completely castrate the child and also remove his testicles and then bring him up as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, but he wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, though, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the internet, survivors of these sex operations have gone public, who are "not happy with the outcome."
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but two-pronged genitalia.
Doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were removed from surgery shortly after the birth in 1976 and he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something wasn't right, he demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth - and none ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitalia.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and removed his breasts.
He has become infertile as a result of the operation.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign one to the child, not specified," she explained.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not yet know how the law will have an impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised as third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
German law is about assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this point in time.
When they have grown up, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a brustradiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law "empowers" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete Androgen resistance.
Because of the prescription defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff member in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and thus gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way, everything is fine - you pull the child big and love it.
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys parenting pleasure.
And you don't have to rush to do an operation that can no longer be undone.
"That includes putting the kids in the decision with and eliminating the anxiety that is driving parents around because they think they wouldn't do the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides the gender that fits better with it - and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novelle "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old hase in his metier, acting art.
No one can deceive the old man of Santiago when fishing.
So the two just add up great.
It is almost thought that the wrinkles can be seen in the neck of the old man referred to by the fisherman Manolo.
When Santiago sits tired of life bowed on the chair, that's real on Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman through and through is a character role that Janson excellently magnifies.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who doesn't give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage in wide stretches as an all-in-one.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologues aren't bored for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that viewers forget that the sea only consists of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light: Santiago's hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who, with her songs and her wonderful voice, captures Cuba's sense of life.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Fancy ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first in the dark shining ice - using qualls.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the sea's fluorescent properties, creating a luminous lickery from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on qualls and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the lump.
Chris explains that the dining ice cream responds to the heat in the mouth and lights up - so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value rises and the ice lights up.
We've tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal for us to put it on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the quale lump is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlies experimental firm based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is set to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is, in itself, impossible because of the light crushing caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we are finding a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quall made artificially by Chinese scientists
SALEM: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
At the next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, 21 October, at the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To hell with hell - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things."
Lecturer is professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical parish Salem, the Salem Castle and the cultural centre Bodenseekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the forum how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, relying on the images of heaven and hell "that have shaped our ideas to this day," contemporary prophetic teaching stands out from the hopes of accomplishment rather through a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out of Christianity by the religious critique," says the lecturer.
She had "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks."
Johanna Rahner continues: "Yet the crucial challenge remains the nuisance of death."
This brings with it the question of that yearning, "who dreams that, in the end, everything will be good."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received a doctorate in 1997 for Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for fundamentals theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard said.
Tips on how to at least manage the wedding ceremony now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has rebounded.
That starts with the wedding dresses, for example.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses, often covered with embroidery, are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down and often end up in a wicket.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller, the ghosts divorced.
In men, the suit dominates with waistband and plastron, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
Important is the choice of the venue, it was explained.
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Carriages are also popular for juvenile internal differences," he reckons.
Romance is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "after-Wedding photo" - that is, recording galleries in special locations, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the feast, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not forgetting the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, tightened an avalanche of lawsuits on Thursday over patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by it at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents amount to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of more than $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outbid on Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the prosecution patents at auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, the accusation said.
Frankfurt parking charges to rise vigorously
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become sensibly more expensive.
The city's magistrat advises this morning on a submission of traffic decider Stefan Majer (Greens).
This means that parking charges should be increased by 50%.
However, the aim is not to raise prices, but to shorten the time interval of parcels and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the Municipal Regulatory Assembly will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea."
The parking facility immediately in front of the store was "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers."
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue."
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Oil price continues to slip to $96 a barrel
The price of oil also fell further on Friday after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December had fallen 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in electronic trading in Europe late morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, meaning a price drop of 5.8 per cent in October.
The large crude oil supply has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand through two reports of an activity increase in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil that is also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
The disposable society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
Only: Hunger is noticeable in people's belongings on the front-passenger and back seat.
Of course, one or other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than chilled off to the next drive-in to indulge yourself a little bit?
I admit I am happy to be with you when it comes to fast food in the late afternoon or early morning.
A couple of pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goodies make themselves felt.
After all, what is missing that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with stubborn regularity?!
On weekends in particular, paper bags are thrown away on the streets and on parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags home with or until the next dustbin?
It is not only the case that the paper is shrouding the landscape.
Bags have also already obscured transport facilities such as guide planks, causing accidents.
But she doesn't think about what this "discarding society" thinks about, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you're travelling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back bench can look like after celebrated nights: Clams, bottles and other garbage towers up there.
There would be a few bags more or less nix - unlike the street, where no one wants to rumble on the food residues of others.
I can already see the day when cities and municipalities will be too fooled to clear up - and the fast food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Milk and egg alternatives in overview
Vegan nutrition requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Peeled tofu with a plant flag is, for example, a replacement.
It is also called the World vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World vegan Day on 1 November, Vegetarierbund Deutschland proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt can be replaced by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, port, almond or reismilch can be used.
Invisible planting beams replace conventional razor beams.
There are herbal alternatives to eggs, too.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of mashed linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Loosely, dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of dining stems and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soya yoghurt, or sildentofu, can serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people are currently eating vegan in Germany, which is purely plant-based.
A blackbox in the car?
Us road planners are looking for a source of money to fix the decaying Highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that finds space in each car's fittings.
The devices, which record every passing kilometre and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state's planning offices to revamp the outdated system to fund U.S. roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarian groups have allied themselves with environmental groups, arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the travelled kilometres - and possibly where they were driven - and then use the information to calculate tax humanities.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per driven mile.
Thousands of motorists have already tested tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we'll just possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans a record of the traveled miles among all California motorists in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from taxes that Americans pay at the Zapfsäule, is pleading.
Yet in America, not as much is being tangled up as it used to be.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state's petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by a penny at high injection prices.
"The gasoline tax is just not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transportation legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most meaningful long-term alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user charge.
Not surprisingly, the idea resonates with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust emissions.
California planners are relying on the system to devise policies designed to achieve the state's ambitious, legislated goals on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The freelance marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of letting drivers pay for the distance they have left.
"That's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, vice president for guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also backed by two former American transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives avoided the push, responding to concerns from MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or into the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
Most committed is Oregon, which currently attracts 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mile fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical about the idea the government could track any of its movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management at Nevada's Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test ran, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into fully-grown surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is among a number of states now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the traveled kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
With that, Khan said, the public would also be more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The firm originally failed to step in to help federal states tax motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are expected to pay based on the miles travelled.
But the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners, because they don't work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more features than they do with others.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a vehicle for taxation that will also allow parking fees to be paid, insurance paid only for driven kilometres, and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, allowing motorists to avoid congestion.
"Motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers," a planning document from the city states.
Some transport planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they, too, pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is also sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz was not lost on the importance for the city and the football club.
I think everyone wanted a pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to take part in it.
Thus, all those who came without umbrella or could not hold such an umbrella for any reason.
That went to the musicians who framed the festival act, as did so many speakers.
Wet became therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of fulfilling a dream.
His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, to the local council, to the companies involved and to the members of the association who took part.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners laid 400 square feet of pavement for the new ways.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also appreciated by the local councillor Karl Rombach.
Other greeting words spoke for the city's sports committee, Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Bavarian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn area in such a way that it could not be sprayed.
It was 15 years ago that the first thought was given to solving the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school on the Salinensee.
Both were discarded again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about setting up an artificial road sports centre, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, committed a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the local council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000, Klumpp summarised.
The construction of the 68-108 metre artificial turf course took place on 4 June.
During the construction phase lasting more than three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were carried away, half of which was used to set up a Dirt bike track.
Unknown hurt girl by shot from car
Unknown have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots fired from a car.
The perpetrators had presumably fired an air pressure weapon at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday night.
That was shared by police in Castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left Wade.
Rescue workers brought the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that was passing by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc crumbled.
They then drove off.
Crime police are investigating, it said on Friday.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence service, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where that asylum has been granted, to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as fiduciary and seeks to criminalise political expression with punitive threats where no defence is possible."
Telling the truth, though, is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that supporting the international community could persuade the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment, filed by the US Department of Justice, includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA had intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a Green Party MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer for the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says out in Germany, he will need an assurance that he is "safe" there, the MP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians - including in the United States - have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to German authorities "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to agree to peace calls during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing for the country's future, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and RENAMO, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
RENAMO was once a notorious rebel movement initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa's aparthood government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely the country will fall back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal wells in the northwest could bring investment of more than $50 billion over the next few years from firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and RENAMO blame each other for the tensions.
RENAMO claims the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked RENAMO bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames RENAMO for the clashes and accuses the organization of assaulting soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a "loser" who wants to use "all his remaining forces to prove he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and RENAMO stress they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that RENAMO is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
To the FT, he said that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and do so seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to settle the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are putting their heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are prepared to make the necessary concessions.
RENAMO, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos's election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party founded by a former RENAMO member of Movimento's Union of Moçambique (MDM) is likely to improve in elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity RENAMO has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale are used to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for a month after RENAMO announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether RENAMO will repeat that threat.
RENAMO wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already sore because of corruption, sluggish progress in development and a recent wave of abduction.
"People think the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people simply wanted stability.
"No interest RENAMO and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
Hansjakob pulls out again in Citizens IHOF
A hundred years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his age in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in "the IHOF."
The many spectators were excited by the extremely short-lived scene game.
From arrival through the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobactor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia's people.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged timelines from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob heim arrives in his children's sky, in his "IHOF."
And then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his paraderolle as the city's great son.
He was introduced by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-poster and "Black Forest foxes."
Not only was he received with a lot of applause from the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it unbelievably well to get into the role of sister and gave her tremendous life in mimics and ghosts.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbach farmers "band played well selected music pieces, thus rounding off the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler, who was represented by the then incumbent Hättich, together with part of the city council, gave the honour of awarding the honorary citizenship.
Their warm-up was followed by the three-royal singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh how beautiful, there will again be youth memories alive to my own three-royal period."
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the "IHOF" as well as the storks with their loud "Heraus, Heraus."
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A troubled mind had finally found its calm and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
Plenty of applause and lots of loving words there was from the audience for the performance.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after appeal
A Chinese newspaper on the front page called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation should be reformed, a press egulator explained.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial company.
Now the New Express will undergo "comprehensive rectification," the regulator said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express's editorial management was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said one had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and strip him of his reporter license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a full reclamation of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officials at the New Express be identified and immediately checked by the New Express's management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper issued two calls for his release on the front page and put himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television, admitting that he had published false reports on pay.
"In this case, I've damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public trust," he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it in the first place because I was out on money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, saying it had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Various well-known suspects have recently filed confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Löffingen: Heads still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstadt Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own city works, can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The only candidate to succeed Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer standing for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old bank businessman and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6pm.
Haigerloch: Evening makeshift skirt gets into focus
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public themed tours on Sunday 27 October, the evening church.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerlocher period was to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
Crowning final point is a visit to the Abbey Church.
There, the leaders get to tell the story of the church's construction and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also looks at the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model by Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the box office of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is at your disposal for questions and information.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had collaborated as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten dinner with the altrocker, and that "he purged me when I was 18."
She added: "This has been a long time ago and he's been very nice to me."
In a statement, a Jaggers representative, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denied that he ever made any approximation attempts at Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she has confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year's Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album "Prism" landed at number 1 this week.
NSA declares' internal error 'and not hackers are to blame for crash of website
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unreachable for several hours tonight as an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency explained in a message sent by email.
The problem will be fixed that evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours and that for some users it still isn't.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Classified information is not at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), now finds itself in the bright light of the public and is facing sharp criticism following the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad - a result of the classified NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US late-night case in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the federal general prosecutor's office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia as well.
That notified the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such an issue could be resolved between states, it was said.
Snowden's exit from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the US, Snowden is threatening extradition there, it continued
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life," says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools," which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that among authors and teachers who were "overly didactic," children would be "completely turned off" because in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed "underneath."
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults, and an author writing for children, lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be presented underneath, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of counting.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre appears to be resisting the trend.
The company has raised its profit outlook for the full year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted pre-tax annual profit of between $325 and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its earlier forecast.
If current target values are met, then that means growth of 12 to 17 per cent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011 / 12.
As managing director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and booked a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australian and UK private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on their way to record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he explained.
These include Australia and Britain, which are typically among our strongest earnings figures.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It went similarly well for Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while here, too, business customers spent less.
U.S. business recovered versus the seasonally weaker first half of the year, expecting a full-year profit for the third year in a row.
Shares of Flight Centre rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Falkenberger Discothek makes for two terrific evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party," on tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with a OR 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are naturally promised by the organisers on both days.
Post barely leans on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for Sunday's lease are still at various letterboxes of the core city and the city districts, but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, one quickly finds out that the lease no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether or not to be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in response to the FDP's request.
The FDP's social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up on this.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially in the case of terminal mail.
"This undertaking, despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, is radically and unreasonable."
Thomas Bittner, Liberal group and city association chairman, supports his group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the lease times are being secretly changed or also deleted."
The post office is a short distance from the city centre.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono said.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens, would have to be able to reach a mail box with Sunday blankets on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city government was planning discussions with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, his knowledge is that there is also a Sunday lease in Hofheim.
Your party was in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.

Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
'We're going to support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn '.

Haslach: Skepticism softens growing confidence
The elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, will change the basic elements of the Haslach (SE) seaworthiness unit.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese no longer need to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear that scepticism about the new was reluctantly but increasingly giving way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main officials of the seafaring team have been enough.
On the basis of a presentation, Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for seafaring units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, SE Haslach, as a church community, will form a public law body which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six separate church communities so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest will be represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish; in the six parishes, so-called community deteams are formed on the ground.
In the future, their task will be to promote church life in the place.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish, there was a considerable need for dialogue.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes will be maintained in a purpose-built manner.
The liabilities, on the other hand, extend to the community as a whole.
There has been a great deal of concern, particularly with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which will then be made by all the parishes.
"Even in the past, investment was made only in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Haslach parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes depicted Barbar Ritter, the chairwoman of the body in the seawater unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they set themselves the task of 'becoming one, staying five' and found that this is not at all easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Season Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community deteams.
The preparations will be made more specific in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seawater unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Foreign property owners tax against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally leaked the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes in the 2012 budget, costing over £2 million as well as annual fees for buyers holding homes as a firm rather than individuals.
Already, income from stamp duty for residential care in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea councils exceeded £708 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year, bringing together proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of related legislation against a deal, it is hard to claim that high-quality properties are taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated council tax system."
"Yet this move could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of buying properties in London, or discouraging owners from selling," he added.
First-class properties - the top five to ten per cent of the housing market by price - in affluent London's south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have soared by the record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
Prices in central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to an investigation by Savills.
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood at the Handball-Oberligisten.
That leaves coach Tomasz Malmon in no doubt at all.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated at the cause.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I no longer know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet knocked out any trees, Malmon is warning the pointer in advance.
Many players I have trained myself in A-Youth.
So they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"We also have to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first," the SG coach points out.
To finally get back into the track of success, the Malmon team definitely needs to increase compared to past appearances.
Especially in the cover work and in the switchover game, it was huge last time.
Recycling also definitely needs to be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
U.S. wants to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of unauthorised disclosure of classified information.
So he would have to face criminal proceedings in the U.S., U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Snowden's recent comments wouldn't change that either.
Previously, German Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki stressed that his comments were that of a parliamentarian rather than that of a German government member.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have considered, in secret, replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign trail, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times has a copy of the soon-to-be-released book, and it reported on Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to find out if it would be better for Obama's dwindling hope of re-election if he let Biden fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, national policy correspondent for the Times, the book painstakingly traces the history of the efforts of senior staff of the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the effect it has on the poll ratings of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe - knew about the planned change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move, after data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought: "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the polls.
"In campaigns, not as much money is spent on polls and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," Martin explained on AC360.
It's not clear, though, whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was "aware of the possible change," the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know anything from the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Possible," Martin replied.
Local councillor pleased with solid budget
Whenever it comes down to the budget in council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The commonwealth in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known about debt since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be booked as a complete success.
This was made clear when presenting the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million over EUR 1 million was higher than planned.
The surplus in the administrative budget, at around EUR 1.8 million, was also around EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the local government's share of the income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million earmarked, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is largely due to the higher input from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
Since less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the allocation of reserves has also been higher.
In total, the overall reserve was increased by some EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"Such a work doesn't just shake you off your sleeve," praised Gerster, looking at the annual bill.
He and local councils visibly joked about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to renounce high leverage rates in the past.
According to Gerster, however, this in turn has often reduced subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory measures.
Among other things, cities and municipalities that apply for grants must provide certain leverage.
"The issue of leverage is something we need to look at as investments are due in the coming years for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Hostages: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg reaffirm their faith in firming
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the seafaring unit Am Kleine Heuberg have been firmed.
The church service was accompanied in the morning by the Laudato-Si group, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firmament, the youths said yes to their baptism and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over the past few months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of many community members, the firmlings had prepared for the big festive day.
In various projects, they got to know different tasks of the Christian community building and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Despair of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican nominee's blockadetachment
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone strikes
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book I believed it would enlighten me during the divisive second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I am finished and go to bed with my patients' papers in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could breathe breath into a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers held on to highlight the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a nasty awakening, as if taken out of a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that partisan blockadetachment has dumped too many aspirations that our nation should be moving forward with: Immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why interception of foreign heads of state is allowed or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers who disclose state misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House's efforts to ruin the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And, more recently, it can't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act passed.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood, at 18, that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the Chamber of Deputies is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unelaborate alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope of which we had been hearing for so long.
But with the drop in approval ratings for Obama at below 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have broken up into air.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to mount a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with election aides after the decision, he told his staff they would have to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to regain our spell," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat of Ibiza drove city-wide on Thursday evening, about 8 p.m., on the left lane of the bilingual Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left bench in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old contestant driving there.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged.
In total, about 15000 property damage emerged, police said.
The carriageway had to be blocked during the accident shooting, it said.
In Pfullendorf, electricity becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorfs have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, opposite the SÜDKURIER, a four-person family of Pfullendorfer has an additional cost of between EUR 70 and 90 per year.
The major reason for the impending price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This transfer will be reset each year in October by the four operators of the major power routes.
They quantify the additional costs they will incur from the energy changeover, which they will be able to charge over the electricity price by means of a levy.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The energy company's supervisory board had even assumed a higher deposition in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before city works could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number more likely to be close to 2 cents.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village kindness - the lack of speech, the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the anguish and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is known mainly as a prosthetic author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze," which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose texts.
The theatre-maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiaturen from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
The eight-person ensemble hangs through the text material on the largely empty stage - important requirements: A cracked sofa on which it is suggested to copy and masturbate.
In doing so, director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overrides the template with a plethora of directorial pieces, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
The actresses, in particular, get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic conversions.
They are touched hard, dipped with their heads under water, dipped with their evening robes to the wall.
Forced into Zellophan or Mieder, they staked on dangerously high sticks by staging, either monologising them loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is scarcely conveyed in this strident way.
The best moments of the evening are when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk lyrics.
It is only towards the end that the overturned performance comes to rest, and Winkler's downright absurd humour looks dazzling.
Basketball: The hope of the neckar giants grows
The chances for the Ligne stay of the sportsmanlike Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketballer have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then for the neckar giants there is now a competitor less.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible rear seat.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the wildcard procedure, so long as it's not fixed that Düsseldorf won't get a licence," Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Up to 23 May, auctioneer Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Court of Arbitration and prove its economic eligibility for the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The Court of Arbitration is the last instance.
