The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to cement economic ties with the world's third-largest economic nation.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is reportedly also hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrested 20-year-old after speeding motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it 125 km / h in a 70km / h zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they watched it as it left a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km / h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the Haltesignale and continued on Burgess Road before bowing off into the bushland, where officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person matching the driver's description were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police are accusing a 20-year-old man of failing to take a hold as well as reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the District Court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands trial over the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out the indictment at a hearing by the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The indictment reads that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Thinking back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Staff Enforcement Act, together with the civil rights body John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination for the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act to create a way for workers suspended for discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and comply with labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that militarized autocracy, Hedki Tojos, would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "workers" rights to unification and common bargaining and action are guaranteed. "
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Acknowledging that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to diminish it are zero and void; measures aimed at doing so are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and to allow that union to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - had to be protected.
Indeed, having these rights under attack in America, it is very wise to re-examine the American ideal whereby the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the working-class movement did not limit the nation's strength, but widened it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would have presumably led to the closure of all five of the state's abortion clinics.
That measure, which was brought into law by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is scheduled to take effect on September 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient reception facility at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for the time being, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they seek to obtain these rights," federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be scheduled for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and said doctors thus waited more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a deferred law that wants to take away their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for entry rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, say consent rights require unnecessary restrictions on physicians.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect women's health, though some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient-entry rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor, fearing for his safety, would no longer perform the surgery, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patient consent rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from egg stockpiles cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video message online for their mother, who died of egg stockpile cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from egg stockcancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, which found egg stockpiles cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 per cent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small STUDIE: New medicines could slow lung and egg stockpile cancer
The researchers looked at women's medical care over seven years.
Dr Jordan said a woman's age when diagnosed, the type of egg stockpile cancer, existing pre-illnesses as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why outside of the city, women were more likely to die from egg stockcancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in telemedical services in order to counteract the distances somewhat, as a possible remedy, it proposed a strengthening of the service of incoming doctors to allow specialists to provide women more densely in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr Jordan said that regardless of geographic status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate among women in egg stockcancer and highlighted the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 from the Gold Coast, learned she had an aggressive form of egg stockcancer.
Garden centres regret falling homeowner numbers
The decline along with an increased sink in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products," according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says tenants spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular process of aspiring to pre-gardens for parking purposes and the declining garden size are further factors threatening the industry, where an estimated £5 billion a year is implemented in sales.
In metropolitan London, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a 6-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens doesn't mean people can't pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden adviser for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 protesters stormed the state TV station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now sending again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away, they provided themselves with sticks and stones-equipped clashes with security forces.
Police deployed tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country's army is urging a political solution to the conflict "to waste time and use without violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already made more frequent coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of having cheated in the general election last May.
Protests had escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to invade Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for espionage report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has ordered the country's oldest US diplomat to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the business representative of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel as well as online magazine The Intercept reported that the National Security Agency's former US analyst, Edward Snowden, revealed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major countries were spiing on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's main intelligence service had also targeted Ankara caused much more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Train drivers face consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by train drivers on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The exit announced for 6pm to 9pm will take care of all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the district chairman of the trade union Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are expecting significant outages.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced it was doing everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was hard to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the town of Calvià to the office of the Mallorca prosecutor's office on Friday.
The head of Calvià police on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge-Drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption allegations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the town of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor for Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spain's Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
National Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said authorities' nepotism had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a Sauftour Fellatio.
Island authorities have since sought to stop the regulatory behaviour of alcohol-fuelled holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-fuelled pub tours.
The Playhouse Club where the fellatio incident took place was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Kneipentour organiser Carnage jointly face a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing," with people jumping from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
First spring day with wet and stormy weather impacts flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given southern Australia a wintry surprise, with fierce swings and strong winds impacting flights from Adelaide Airport.
Another 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening to 9pm, after 6.6mm that had already gone down on the night of Sunday.
The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy shells, including a glitch that began just before 8pm and caused almost 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter caused an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a peak of just 15.8 ° C.
The botched weather conditions have likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30pm but was hit by a thunderwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to launch through.
Winds reached about 50km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that point.
Flight data showed the plane also had to take off on a second landing and eventually set up at about 8.40pm.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A top temperature of 16 ° C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible swings.
Matthies thinks: Supreme time for big netting
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switch centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this here, my view of the spiral cable connecting the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable were not, all the listeners would be flying around in the house in the shortest possible time, and that would be even more retro.
Anyway applies on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing errors: Electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is tomorrow's electric scrap, bought - outdated.
For example, if you still have a tube TV in your living room, you simply say that you reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pushing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week shows us once again our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The Laie, who previously blindsided washing machines and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread in front of him with unfathomable expert language: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies," the press office promises us.
Yes, is it still going?
What should we talk to people who seem to voluntarily spread such Quark?
In fact, for some 20 years now, the most important thing is that we should link up our house.
In order for the yogurt to reorder itself, so that the fire detector tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it burns in the working room grad.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our early arrival...?
Yes, that does require air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: We lift our bracelet clock, tell you loud "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner goes off.
Mistaken.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "Blurring the boundaries between white and brown goods," raunt an industry connoisseur, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone jack, the steam garner sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs to be in the oven, which is no use because we are in congestion.
We also know from day-to-day practice that when a new-fashioned device is needed as a matter of urgency, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What's another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection rooms, while missile and mortar fire on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, leaving Gaza schools closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The school launch brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn from missile launches in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the "Pashosh" nursery, which was hit by a rocket, removed pomegranate splitter from the walls and sliding clouds before the students arrived.
"We're a bit scared but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident at Kibbutz Saad and local English teacher.
Many children from our area desperately need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit comical" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke down the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move into safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Department for Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Her children were provisionally housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that is heavily drawn from the Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure their knowledge is acquired and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel is calling for Hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting to be handed over.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputed these claims, estimating that at least half of those killed were fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence of that information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during fighting on Israeli cities, most in the country's south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school is reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza city.
After Election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl questions NPD prohibition procedures
Given the NPD's vote loss in Saxony, CDU federal vize Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition process before the federal constitutional court.
Berlin - Laut CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should put an end to the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," Strobl, who is also CDU national chief in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipzig People's newspaper."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to conclude that we are fighting the NPD politically, not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed in Sunday's vote at the five-percent hurdle.
A first run for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003 because constitutional protection also had informants in the NPD at the time.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and federal parliament did not sign up.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being accommodated in tents in New Orleans Square.
The Central First Reception for Refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the Home Office has set up three Red Cross tents next door.
District politicians have only been informed a short time before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These door-to-door actions continue to fuel citizens" reservations and do not allow district politicians to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees, "says Britta Herrmann, group leader of the Green Party in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party is calling for the Harburg district government to provide currently unused homes for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for overcrowding in the first take-up are the rush of aid-seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely watched index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-share market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 per cent last year, against 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by five and six per cent on average.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices rose just 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless said further evidence would now be seen of a rise in properties for sale for the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test."
"If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the consistently low interest rate environment, it's likely that home prices will rise even further over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts statements made by the managing director, Peer Medau, attacking him for posing "like a fielder."
The style of college is not that, it says in the communication.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the request of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July "is definitely wrong," according to Phattl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'pre-determined or even decisions', but there are 'preferences'.
The development of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than those feared by the Medaus.
There was, and is not, talk of a nine-metre road.
It is currently at 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than before, "explains Phattl.
The argument by the medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will in future only be used by students of the university will not apply.
There is no parking at all because, as with other public car parks, this can now be resolved intelligently.
Remember residents
The Bergwichtel nursery, which is located on the grounds and would lead the entrance to the parking deck on its doorstep, is said to "not be impaired," according to the university president.
Rather, he admits, "that this is not just about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring real school.
So this is about much more than the vested interests of the men of Medau, "he said.
Whether the criticism of the parent council of the nursery, with the expansion of the road would be justified one of "the few natural spots Coburg lost," the reader can decide for himself. "
At the beginning of October, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, he intends to inform the city councillors about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and to address in this context the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had told the parents of the nursery last week about the college's plans.
Therefore, the access for the new parking deck should not pass through the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but over the Medau-Berg.
As a result, the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre in length in two.
According to the Medaus' accounts, the traffic in Hohenfels Castle Park would be ten times greater.
About 2000 vehicles a day are mentioned.
The city did not wish to comment on the project until now.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from federal ligists SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly cited health issues for that decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team, "the 2007 world champion shared on his Facebook page.
He is thus retiring internationally with a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throwback player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on Torehund for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new Bundesdestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic announcing his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my longtime fellow players and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years too, for that to happen, longer regeneration breaks are needed that the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed man had even had to fear his career end in 2012 after suffering a heel infection.
Due to Achilles "problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisol injection, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass without trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot surgeries that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got to grips with my blood pressure properly.
There are a number of other wear-and-tear complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that while I can control my head, I can't deceive my body, "Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine Handball Time.
For a comeback, he would only be ready in absolute emergency.
"When all the knitting is tearing down, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I must also say that, after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humbled as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least reasonably straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup winner's prize with Flensburg.
German economy shrank 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared with the previous quarter.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring as investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, overall GDP added 0.8% for the first half of 2013 compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste," which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste."
This is the biggest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through the Münsterland.
Published in various trade journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We come from Den Helder and went overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way too, "the cyclists joked about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the Wall, where the launch also took place.
In addition, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, headed towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were kept on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing were delighted with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization proceeded without problems and there were no negative incidents, "draws Heinz Lölfing a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, presumably due to the bad weather forecasts and morning rain.
"We see ourselves again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland anyway and the organisers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers softly honest memoir
It's actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Constantin Wecker, Liedermacher, pacifist, politsure activist, ex-prisoner, to paper in "monk and warrior" on 287 pages.
Rather than chronologically, the Munich born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From onanie as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also embraces abstract but all the more important concepts: Love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how not only has he shaped music (the opera-lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who emerges "through subtraction," as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary."
Between all the highly spiritual views, however, there are also brief anecdotes to the earth: For example, about thugs in a venue frequented by GIs, or a mad car ride in which he targeted a tree in front.
Here, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My dad never put me in the arm.
Never said 'I love you'
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsed for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop with the tie.
Leave your sister in peace.
Get away!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bowl.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a bit brighter now, but they're dark, smothered, deep stylish labyrinthe with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just put himself in the tub and then you could hear him slowly singing, because he could wash the foundry of himself.
When I ran around there, it became clear to me that he had done that for years to put the food on the table and my respect for him became greater.
Still, Henry grew up as a child with no love evidence from his parents.
My dad never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother went bad towards the end of her life that we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missing as a child.
Could you stop "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Papa, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you have to be radical.
So I pulled this fitness through and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's career change may be evident in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of irony, and then Fences of August Wilson.
That's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s, with "I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to get big in front of the public eye, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-narrative machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which people mimic themselves "black," Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
That was very unpleasant to my family.
I somehow wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing time around or stepping up a little on the spot."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was downright allergic.
I had never properly learned anything about him at school and mostly considered him a middle-class domain, whitewashed in tights and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words into your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry introduced 20 lines from Othellos's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt I could manage that.
It was almost like someone had finally put my head right.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash, and that just didn't happen.
And he soon appeared in the comedy of irony.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed." "
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me," You now have to bridge for 10 minutes while they fix the computer. ""
Instead, the stage manager announced that the notion would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off stage and anything in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the eyesight.
That was good, too, so it's like a big shield of gods telling me, "This here is your destiny." "
He says this, of course, with a donning voice.
So I stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, though, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for that, you are driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo if I want to do so, but overall it doesn't give me as much as it used to be.
I ask him if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party told "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the sheet, Huthi threatened with further escalation of the conflict should his demands not be met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are calling for the government's resignation.
The ethnic tribe of the Huthi have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have erected protest camps at the major access routes of Sanaa.
There is always bloody fighting in the surrounding area with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Staff who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his 2013 inauguration to fight corruption in the civil service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was lost in payments for "ghost workers" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid out on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres over the next two weeks to ensure their data on biometric registrations is recorded, a government news outlet said.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This action will significantly contribute to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and also berating the payroll at both levels of government - so the 'ghost workers' will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Department of Devolution and Planning.
The scandal over art consultant Helge Achenbach is set to go on trial for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim €19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at Düsseldorf's District Court.
That told a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The lawsuit states that Achenbach cheated when buying artworks and vintage cars, and that Berthold Albrecht charged higher-than-actually-paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for €121 million.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school service for 44 years, 23 of them as a school leader.
From that time on, Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne out of his quest to see the person in the pupil.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau, northern Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14 he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
One year after that, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So it shunned judges into the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do so, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the nearest railway station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping opportunity at a red-cross home in Bamberg: Along with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he made the first and in 1954, after three years, he became the second state attorney general.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free apprenticeship for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, in the newly built teacher's house next to the school, he was referring to a three-bedroom service apartment.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968 / 69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf school association was established, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlovy Vary - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's building from September 1982, which expanded after Judge's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop space built at local cost and in the 1997 expansion, even though this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled thankfully.
During his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a school board statement on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter used what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to find out: "This is not always possible." Whether he means only his students or just his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Judge's tally was sometimes unconventional.
When students checked, they didn't get a punitive job from him, nor were they donated to sit down.
At the expense of the congregation, Judge had created two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two contractors compete against each other, even if there was to be a veil.
For the good of the school, Richter as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to become at least the last on the CSU list for the local council in 1996.
But Judge was selected to place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
Hr4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set off in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers
If cyclists on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots roast, that in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, only the number of riders made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radeln und feiern auf neu entdeckt Wege zwischen Nidda und Kinzig" participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage tackling 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter seum, who was involved in cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen's own company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, twins, spreads and cheese cakes that boiled wonderfully to the capable cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake rural women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordained another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased from the Gymnasium Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The atmosphere of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all he has already re-fortified cramped bike chains."
In the meantime, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking spa house by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also promotional chef Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-cycling tour in 2004 as tour manager, was able to conceal only briefly, since he had plenty to do with the technique on the ground.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated Hessen via three phones and a radio device with his staff and the police's 15-member Hessen motorcycle relay, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhine-Main region," he told, "but also from casting or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists are encouraged.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after an hour and a half: "Chuck!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" They waited to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scots, the group were allowed to take a short snap.
But in the evening, cyclists were called in to the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had a nice festive atmosphere and, of course, it had prepared delicacies such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as Executive Board member of ADAC Hessen-Thuringia welcomed visitors.
The Three were visibly delighted with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen released the dance stage afterwards.
Despite the sporty activity on the bike, the opportunity for swinging open-air trails has been eagerly taken advantage of.
Among the guests, citizens increasingly mingled with the good mood as well as the great shear of cyclists.
On the second day for cyclists the stations Birstein, Guächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - were on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of Radelns, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
Police authorities gave no immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 senior police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organised criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described her actions as part of activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Rullen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held at every school.
The sky is not all over Ukraine peaceful.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school principal in Slawjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She meets with a proud glory drag from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own fronter experience.
She started her career at the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She was executive chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson's top post went to a younger male colleague.
Her severance was reportedly almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: She became the Cabinet's adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
As early as May, I described the chairman's job with a poisoned Kelch.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The trust works in two directions: Inward to the first guard of its own managementhierarchy at the BBC, but also outward as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But which incoming chairman would run the risk of embarking on everything and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps getting around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren't enough, many are also still keen to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the impending negotiation of licence fees for the BBC poses particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into surely the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: It says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs each of them just 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 per cent support it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my mobile phone these days and see missed programmes later on on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says lowering tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney's office that is at the center of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another from Perry's user account, which cut off the previous one.
Right now, a tweet has been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," it read in the later message.
Staff at Perry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets went out of Perry's official user account, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavorable picture was drawn of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunkenness at the wheel in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who may be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with triple permitted alcohol levels... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he exits it."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not charged with directing over the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio special prosecutor selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of legal counsel applied to the judge charged with the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law passed against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
That veto provided a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at election rallies in Iowa during his 2012 presidential run, Perry alluded to speculation that he was going to stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market back to 'normal'
One of London's most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned to normal levels."
Homes in the capital were hotly sought after and subject to huge price rises, prompting the Bank of England to set ceilings on mortgage lending in June because of widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak," adding that this offers a "stable operating environment."
The London property market was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Katasteramt, prices in the city area alone jumped 18.5 per cent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average selling prices at Berkeley's private, low-priced and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and were up by the £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of which have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "Villensttax" before next May's general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which featured tougher lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday shows a drop in mortgage approvals in July, which also suggests the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another property agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 to be down 3 per cent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Yet the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for futures sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained steady and as a result futures sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40 per cent to £280 million a year, sales up 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said revenue for Berkeley in the current year was expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit to be £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood firm in London trading in the afternoon at £23.96.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Oscars ceremony.
Naked photos of Oscarprice winner Jennifer Lawrence have been posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "masterlist" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will track down all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on photo-sharing page 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple's online storage system icloud, the alleged "masterlist" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, Buzzfeed reported.
It's not certain how many of the images are genuine, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim versus the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our home - I hope you're so properly satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "victorious" denied that the photos were about pictures of her acting and tweeting "These so-called nude images of me are fake, people.
Let's go back to the beginning. * wordplay *.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande dismissed the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J."
They crumbled, so it was best to describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box to be left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, one woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distancing and perhaps a bit scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
Scratch-brushed, he knew.
He was steeped, as in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stagnation was an affair that was just beginning, which was more promising to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the Nordinsel that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older escort, which Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leak, in the bathrooms were still spiders, nude snails had left their marks on all windows and believed they belonged to them all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so properly banned - just didn't play.
It has been successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste managed what decrees and regulations would never have been achieved, and how people choose venom-teller-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love romanes on books, so they chose the ballads when it came to music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and curling big feet in a rough-comic serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained to her, and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That had always been done by his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you have a word with a J initially, without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz, even if he wasn't directly banned, wasn't playing.
The impeachment was no longer modern.
It was just room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the start of a tune where it would end up.
So does the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society thankfully agreed to the principle of group talent - thankfully like those spurred on by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body building, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, as they were by nature, and looked after with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewer; what was left of the Greeks, Teller crushed.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR, WENN ES GESCHEHEN WAR - fearful of being indicted for gunfire, fearing even that the flames would eat them next - had opened labeling and shisha-pipe restaurants, considered themselves and were depressed with the impress.
Everyone according to his abilities.
As she had heard only ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just spoken to her could ever be tweeted.
Music was an expression of love.
"Those aren't really offensive," Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for people whose feet are too large.
My dad never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of safety.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant carbonated leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like this?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something odd.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook unbelievably her head and locked Keverns's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world other than her unchewed rave black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain yet why you pretend it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly don't.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song, after all.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why you fake me," he tried it instead.
I'm a bit perverse there.
It didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be comic, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the reassuring charm you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern, that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her deckchair, threw the console around and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Holunderbloom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel perverted towards you," she said...
Except that I'm not that at all.
She was sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean collapsed here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dazzling to DEM WAS GESCHEHEN WAR than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always willing to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laundered them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't match up!
They first crack - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-gift to the nonetheless loving ballads from the console - they first crack and then beat.
According to Keverns, this was an unnecessary refinement, since Knutschen itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt lasting, but the splendour of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk away - as if from a room on the top floor her companion was watching him - a man complained by something he had raised himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her.
One man turned away from her, his back bowed, shamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she couldn't remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, worked on a brief lecture on the continued low and medium-level violence in precisely the parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely to be expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in eradicating it.
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt historically despite the high-rise church towers between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to awaken.
The population is crying while listening to sentimental ballads, depriving itself of stories of overwrought difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only is the previous raw material keeping rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in control, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said as he read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
ESME nut tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme referred to her right to privacy and denial of statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbian or feminism.
This is a presumptuous workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort outcomes as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things you call "deafening" and "raw" could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue riding around, WAS GESCHEHEN IST, WENN ES GESCHEHEN IST, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away its essential vitality from the country.
ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED font in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter-century or longer.
Smile at their neighbors, value their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the healthy word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," Esme Nussbaum replied with quiet voice when she was sure that her superiority had ended, "and I say nothing other than that we are not yet as effectively cured as we are pretending to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that led in the first place to THE WORLD IST, WENN ES GESCHEHEN IST.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave out our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angel's patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe actions as" mistakes "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far in saying that these would have left out their "anger" and their "distrust" of "others."
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others."
There was no "us" and there was no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of that, if we are honest with ourselves," wagged Esme, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I don't sue anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And, just as no blame must be assigned, no guilt must be paid if such a amortisation is appropriate, and if there is a way to eradicate it.
But what serves the past if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say anything about this -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had been driving on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup was planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials from the military in Lesotho contended they planned a coup to overthrow the government and said they were going against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the country's army had encircled his residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reports of assault threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no coup attempt, but that the military was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" whose weaponry was imminent by police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to wreak havoc," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a reshuffle.
"Even though no one has claimed to have grabbed the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Spokespeople for the Lesotho military told reporters on Sunday that the soldiers were dragging themselves back into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, vice premier Mothetjoya Metsing is taking over governance during Thabani's absence.
Thabane shared that he believes he has become the target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been major tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, contrary to accusations to the contrary.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
The rise in output in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the past 13 months, according to a closely watched study with.
The final Markit purchasing managers' index of the manufacturing sector (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand-off of 51.8 in July.
A number over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a sluggish eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details later this week on whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While small growth is better than no growth at all, the bracing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a sore child, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial echanism are no longer harnessing Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also not reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.
The decline in the industry is presumably fueling the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing managers' index of manufacturing in the eurozone from August is that after that, the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Eurozone producers obviously find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - widen uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - particularly, and consumer confidence, and presumably lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it was becoming "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch a type of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The ghostly decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the Greueltat in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, that seemed like the most arduous of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the Greueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children die like them - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famously dressed only in her underwear trying to climb back into the shattered school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"One woman told me I should be racing around my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were blood-floored.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she considered herself completely cured but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to operate again.
Some pomegranate splitter is still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me up," she says campaigning.
'that's what happened to me and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
'i don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, though the memory gets a little weak every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of me climbing back to school, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help ensure that something like this doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me I should lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him: "Run."
Terrified that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying infant on the way, grabbed it at hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who joined his son outside in the arms, said: 'Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries at the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said: 'I cry with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop by remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it gets blunt in my memory.
I still know that immediately afterwards I threw away all my toy pistols.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
'i'm not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself after that.
I remember these kids I played with in the yard and who didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the games shop, where I could pick out everything I wanted, and ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he's afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I want to be so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waitresses in a restaurant; Damir shot his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that Britons so readily shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think this world hasn't gotten any better in those 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just such children as ours.
I think for many the war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir became great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not overwhelmed by the past greats.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends out of class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes put himself on the sofa, turned off the face of us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys; Damir is now 17, bigger than me, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts everywhere around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived impossible in this hell.
"I remember calling him," Damir, run, run away, "but I was also so sure he had not heard me.
But he heard it and he's gone away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrific image after the siege became the symbol of Beslan's abominations
Solace: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodstained face was marred by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarity.
His mother Fatima, 54, a physician, had dropped him off for his first day of school before going loose to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days keep tracking me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Insightful: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalised as a statue (right)
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, saying that he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
'i doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of that Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something of a horror.
'i can't understand how that's possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when September 1 is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't condone it.
My life continues.
I finished school this year and went to a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Faniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it would have been yesterday," says Georgij, who as an intelligence officer wanted to go to the FSB but couldn't do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say kids can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
'i worked with psychologists in 2006 and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or talking about it and they never asked me about it after school.
Physically it goes well for me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's intelligence academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've got two years behind me there.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: 'I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It has to be a lot more intense for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and all of them are drawn here in Beslan.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept that when something so unfair occurs.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several occasions, he can run but doesn't practice any sport.
I would say he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome that and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying around the roasted.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want that.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I almost can't believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby so gracefully carried by a special operations commander in safety
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is taken to safety by a Russian special operations command (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the cruelty at all
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but held back in their cruelty to their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then aged three, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and, with his new wife Swetlana, has a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not recall the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbours say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of assaulting girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for assaulting a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having approached a girl on the transition at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Steward had steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the allegation before Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC suspended the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you'd like to take photos or videos underwater, there's a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are available for around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly locked.
Also, adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, check to what depth your equipment is functional.

Take multiple shots - because many won't fold.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD that lets you compose images, Action-Cams usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it's difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a good thing.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a terraced mode that makes a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface if you're taking shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to put more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It's especially important when you're working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill out the entire picture drawer.
Andrew Lawson was a man of sorts whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organisation as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesia physician, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew doctors' diagnoses and illnesses are important, while those treated are mostly preoccupied with something completely different: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I didn't feel like that," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble racking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noted that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I want everything to happen immediately rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and alarmed for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The outcome of the X-ray investigation was ahead.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, i.e. the skin that overstretches the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually hard to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers used to be smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered a "miracle material," but has since been identified as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it hardly seems worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in Britain
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not confined to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or ages.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament's buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber, either.
It was, in fact, hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like a lot of asbestos was present in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." He wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pförtner - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my old people will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from mesothelioma in the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us will still be ill?
At Andrew Lawson, mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This has been an unusually long survival period.
Fifty per cent of all mesotheliomerate sufferers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a halt, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which those affected often turn because of claims for damages, shows just how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is already.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having inadvertently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible via the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years as when she began her business at M & S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "had I never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "assemble form," a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is nonetheless considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "major health risk" with possible death row.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesotheliac victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension was caused by work or in the home presumably by asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts, he says, are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people at the heart of the government, too, may have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service cabinets and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be fired up by something as harmless as "strong air movements."
Members of Parliament are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had been given a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work needs to be put up over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that MPs are more likely to meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green benches after the 2015 general election.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working on, and the data.
What he just recalls is the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and performed surgery just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had shaking frogs.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I believed the ride home was no longer going to create.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain stemmed from the chest fall, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and set up Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the lab.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health was slowly improving, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbott with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was launched into the cave between the rib and chest fell.
I'm an optimist.
I mostly just keep going, "he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so many at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy lay ahead in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who haven't worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asematic solids in hospitals were below ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their federal burns on asbestos mats.
And it doesn't just affect hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical rounds, students put off their federal burns on asbestos mats.
On websites, the subject of asbestos is now frequently raised in schools.
And meanwhile, so innocent items in our homes, such as floor plates or slippers, have by default contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial gift that is contained in much of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial at Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that struck an affected woman was the demolition of a garden carpet in the 1970s.
So watch out for how to tear off your garden scales.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor's position to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to come to terms with.
"It was very hard to absorb all that," he says.
"I asked my doctor" how long do I still have? "
And one still gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Na yes, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
That's then. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it's our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is swirled and the fibres are inhaled, they can become stuck in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Thorax physician who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects it has exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, who were presumably also exposed to asbestos during her training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it's invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers don't work so well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested, for example.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest fell," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't address chemotherapy very well," which "shows impact" but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and advisory office for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer central," he jokingly tweeted on calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles lasting four months and his life was expected to extend for just one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-Thorax specialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be referred forward, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and have to wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments eventually inevitably fail, many concerned stand by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 "s was that it was recognized that a very small burden also posed a health risk.
And here, corporate negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-blown compensation" as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, following the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
Indeed, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to assign deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of her former employers have been sold or shut down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers can no longer be found.
The law has established a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 can prove a contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 per cent of what a court could have told them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers that £350 million represented a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"That's a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not gone beyond it and Mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Work and Pensions Minister, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that quick action was needed on a daily basis, given seven fatalities.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that point, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 per cent over five years.
Abbott felt emboldened.
"That's obviously with the most important thing," Abbott says.
This is seen time and time again in patients.
There's something there that lets you move on.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scanners showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just became 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No trace of the tumours is now visible.
But the process is very strenuous physically and psychologically.
You have to think about practical things - about money when I'm no longer, for example, or my wife showing how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"For parents, that's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unbridled.
She told it to her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomerate sufferers, such conversations are not driven by hope, not by a trail of hope for survival.
The disease brings grim safety (as it does finally for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, China's parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists began planning and mobilizing them within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision by China's People's Congress basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This doesn't come unexpectedly, but it does make us angry after all," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
People lied to the residents of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents elect the government's president from 2017.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong's citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that China's leaders remain firmly in control of the process through a closely controlled nominating committee.
A new clause also seeks to allow only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong."
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicized protests took place in Hong Kong for a number of years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shutdown the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.
As of Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within hours of being pronounced dead.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new stage of civilian disobedience and planned to stage protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any more details on this, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online notice, the organizers said that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the central district as a last resort, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and there were heightened security measures in front of the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The movement of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement's demonstrations as threatening the business operation - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they are talking about could cause major economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to raise fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school-leaving balls in the US will now be transferred to universities, where freshmen will be offered appearances with the private plane.
We are excited to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service to students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service had a security save.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to coil their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Along with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure this year students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said no new bookings had yet been made since the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service over the next few weeks."
The company also shared that it expects a market for that offer despite tuition fees of £9,000 a year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Students Union, however, criticised the service as being lifted.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for higher education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living costs, as available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something more simple than arriving at the student home.
Feminists criticise racial issue and police behaviour, according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot" as they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Midwest rose, however, and received attention across the country, Perez saw that responses from white women turned 100% around race.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shots, the personal essays came with titles such as "thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not just about suppressing women" relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you find in feminism a lot of people who are talking about being white and being privileged in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnised that they have to express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems faced by black Americans every day but not considered "women's" in cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I poste something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is earnest.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship but not about safety in public space?" She asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women haven't had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century, noting that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group each: Women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you realise with power why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against the Lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from pages of black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fancy" with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great for the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms to approach the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointer article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian's columnist, calling for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand an inherent danger to the body - and opinions on race that are markedly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
While Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some are stunned by her comments on the racial theme in America.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole feminism?" Said opposite She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson stand in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently put up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem pushing itself into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women's scheme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an essential women's issue, she simply had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find an aftermath in women's organizations," she said.
"Pigs house" in Ipswich stands for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by property agents when it became apparent that it showed a large pig it had made comfortable in the living room.
The detached home has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is being offered for £120,000.
Among the details was an image of the home's living room - which included a pig that had grabbed his head on a sofa.
Estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo, however, was mistakenly released and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family home."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW town of Harvey home to a new millionaire after lottery profit
A lottery player from Harvey is out this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division's draw for the second time in five years, after earning $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit provided care for talking material in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made the $7.5 million mega-profit just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world tour and the purchase of a new home.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas bat into glam arena
Not only the gladiators stood in the middle of the Matsch at the first day of Rheinbach Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who stood up to the rain showers and the autumn cold and were unfazed by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful friction of depictions, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Martian fighter force from the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the soft sand-crafted arena.
Gladiatorial owner "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and subsequently sent his men into the ring for heroic two-fight in various gladiator engagements.
First the "Provocators" were on the turn with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and root plant as well as iron gladiatorial helmet, leg and arm protection.
The performance of the "RETIARIUS" (RETIARIUS), which competed against the "SECUTOR" ("SECUTOR") with a sausage net, triceps and daggers, was particularly impressive.
As the swords clashed metallic, the shields shepherded and the sausages flew surgically through the arena that could become a fear and bange around the health of the gladiators.
But to them, the imposing "Summa Rudis," the muscular referee, had an ever-attentive eye.
"We wanted to resurrect Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era vivid," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal," the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum," a Roman city, became a day out of the leisure park, as Vizeburgermeister Claus Wehage noted in his greeting word.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired on Roman Day, such as "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman Canal Bridge, which was once at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company contracted water and energy supplies once and for all, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then."
This is also confirmed by graduate surveyor Ralph Heiliger of the "Engineering TeamTwo" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocrite, the hot air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left in clay by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago, before brandishing them.
In 2011, the Office for Ground Monument Care at the National Association of Rhineland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and painting have been found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of finds from these excavations featured them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels as well as parts of a zierous necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, to the fall of the Germanic in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's milling game, or, like the Roman students, they wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bathe glass mosaics at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre use a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flavor bread or a muesli.
The original Roman carriageway, drawn by two cold blossoms, drove visitors through the leisure park, passing by the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of its "Römer-Projektwochen."
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Rhineland-wide Roman Year 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided school classes are offered and reminiscent of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will tell of his work on the present Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman period, and provide a witty lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and conquered Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project study.
The Roman Week is intended to re-experience the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often not visible at first sight.
In the town hall of Wachtberger, a small presentation will recall the fund of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtums in 1879.
Ebola: Epidemic strains West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to West Africa's economy.
The harvest is scrambling on the fields, the mines are deserted and the markets orphaned - the virus has severely inflicted on the region.
Some international companies, too, are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, ruled.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second-largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
The only thing that comes onto the market is who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, and here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more have been stuck.
Foreign firms pull off employees
Companies operate across resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: Few merchants are still leaving their homes to buy supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans in the fields, which are important for export, roam.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food gets scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, would rather stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the effects of the epidemic directly and urgently: Food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is in danger of being damaged - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international firms will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What is crucial is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may get the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest," Hugon warns.
The disease is also straining states' strained state budgets
The disease is also affecting the already strained national budgets of the countries concerned.
Credit rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets will be heavily strained by high spending on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are already palpable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
It is true that the oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Protect celebrate her 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, preparations are under way for the 50-year-old founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
Planned is a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" on Friday, September 12.
Saturday's big arcade shooting is at 6pm.
Afterwards in the big party tent is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam."
Bubble Chapel provides for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festgottesdienst and 9.30am in the parish church and the big feast train at 2pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and palate shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdamen with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the brass chapel of Berngau.
The patrons took over mayor Wolfgang Wild and state secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercise in room storing and small-scale shooting."
The Nazi regime had prompted the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves, who raised Berngau from baptism on 30 April at the Lukas inn, the "new" protection association "Tannenwald.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult initial period, in which it was primarily a matter of finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the fall of 1965 the Schützenverein in the inn "Leininger" started with two teams in the round competitions.
In the years that followed, sports activists, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records purged every year and the magic border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the efficiency of the active shooters has increased, so have the number of members.
After the local association "Leininger" no longer satisfied the demands of a modern association of protectors, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988 Pfarrer Strasser granted the church blessing for the new trench rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th shooting of the palate, coupled with the solemn inauguration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a group of barrels was established.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllern" and for the association as a whole was the alignment of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work last year, the club members modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof, bringing them up-to-date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in runaway competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round-the-world competitions: Six aerial rifle teams, one aerial pistol team, one sports pistolen KK1, one youth team and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up in the 2013 / 14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstands, carnival and royal ball, club trips and Christmas parties have a tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivities in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to race track
Tony Stewart's return to the circuit ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the Wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst into round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed, but is now focused on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I entered today with quite good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the wicketkeeper and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash train race in northern New York state.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the roadway during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart must face an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was presented ahead of the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart entered the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily ranked fourth.
After a restart in round 122, ripped bushs
Car with the No 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both carriages driving against the wall.
Stewart continued but fell to number 21.
Dance joyful offspring sought
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to joining in.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups can also be found in TV's Annual of All-Day Teaching at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups found themselves severely decimated.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and fun.
Only nine children remain in the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits."
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old tells reporters.
With more active, the whole thing would be significantly more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographs," she says.
If you are interested in dancing, you can sneak into the training session on Thursdays between 5pm and 6pm or Fridays between 5pm and 6.30pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," the trainer tells the crowd.
After that, various choreographers are practiced.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from folklore through classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in the Jazz Dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short either.
"We are also eating, watching dance films and we have already stayed in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dancing, you can sneak into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always take part in classes on children's dancing / jazz dancing, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance nights on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in Discofox, Langsamen Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can look back and join us.
Bulgarian prison supervisors protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from across Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Judiciary Office in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their calls for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a compensation list to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours, calling for a return to the earlier 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the national Bulgarian ratios (BNR).
Negotiations continue, the director general for carrying out punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The prison staff protest is expected to be supported by members of the trade union Association of Interior Ministry employees.
Ukrainian army abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the Prussian fighters remain on the rise.
After heavy fighting, in which allegedly Russian tank battalions were also involved, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel conclusions from his army's heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists, announcing changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists once again shot down a fighter jet and two military helicopters, according to their own account.
Some 100 troops were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents told Russian agencies on Monday.
Coastguard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats from the Ukrainian coast guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
Ukraine's border guard confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
In doing so, seven border guards had been injured, a spokesman in Kiev told broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In advance, all the actors used their appearances to publicly announce their request.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned deployment in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a gross breach" of the deal.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Russian documents and statements show "that they see us as opponents."
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is needed," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision from the European Union whether to send a representative to the talks as well.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been receiving fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies for Europe.
Europe derives around a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Toll will come 'very clearly'
Now the Chancellor has once again made a clear commitment to this.
However, it is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly gripped CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent opposition from her CDU.
"To be quite clear, she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," the party chefin said Monday after meetings of the CDU's top governing bodies in Berlin.
For the time being, Merkel did not lay down herself on a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal and we are now working on that."
The NRW-CDU, however, insists its No to a toll is equal on all roads.
Merkel stressed that even Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructively engaging in deliberations for a bill.
Beyond the issue, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other ways of activating more private capital for infrastructure investment, including broadband expansion, for example.
"There's nothing special about that." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his home reviewing a concept of his own to compensate highway investors with toll receipts - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer subsequently warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU federal vize Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition treaty never went from mowing down all county and federal roads," the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU state chairman said.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will discuss the subject again.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU state federations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from members of the CDU.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party chief Bernd Riexinger told the New Osnabrücker newspaper (Monday).
"With the toll failing," Dobrindt wants to introduce vignettes on all German roads to launch in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not be charged extra, however, according to the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they are to receive full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model must not penalise foreign drivers for their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A Britin says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK shared that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disruptions such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gear and curved toes.
Sufferers also suffer from debilitating feelings or pain; the disease is incurable and protracted, meaning symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, now 51 years old, said: 'As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell asleep all the time and everything took longer with me.
I could never ride rolling shoes or skateboard with the other kids and was often hanged at school because of my way of going and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after multiple surgeries to discharge her Achilles and stretch her feet, she saw her health records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone that, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and scared to panic.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between slowly all my skills would lose.
I made it all up with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, it became clear to her that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just stood up, and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you've got that, otherwise you're already warming up in the wheelchair right now."
I think you've got something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel A. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop training facility.
There has been no shooting at the former troop training ground in Münsingen for almost ten years.
Yet every month, lethal ammunition appears in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere region.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they need to be blown on the ground.
An ear-drenching bang hallucinates during the explosions across the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the troop exercise site of Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been the centerpiece of the Swabian Alb biosphere region, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax modest rates for businesses in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the Area District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in state and local jobs in the 2013 financial year, a 3.8 percent increase over 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive growth year after the several years of declining motives in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is grounded in a recovery in the company's real estate values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of those gains came from big states like California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in Maryland in raising government and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over a fifth of companies "tax motives.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, this is happening: Much of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market
Corporate revenue also appears to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the region's highest amount.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly in all three places.
The increase rate in the District matched the national average, at 4.3 per cent, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas of office, has the noticeably lowest corporate income taxes (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the District at a relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia, and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the District.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will presumably continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in overall multi-tax revenue for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period the previous year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cut impacts on the region's labor market.
Downtown: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's former city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's former city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," the Vice-Party Secretary of the South China Metropolis, Li Yiwei, said this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, warb Li.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hesse-based SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host he would be rehearsing in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer, it doesn't need much: Good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre already radiates Mr. Li, he flattened the host.
The Guangzhou official then met with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine served at the dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Reinheitsgebot.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice party chief Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local councillor showed convincing.
"Business relations between our two cities are increasing."
Currently travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight.
The province's Vice-Governor, Chen Yunxian, put this desire to the fore in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodding approvingly.
Well-maintained partnership
Guangzhou's lethal vice-party chief hopes he can visit Frankfurt at a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in that role.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is being enforced with toughness by leader Xi Jinping.
New top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The link to the 9,000-kilometre Guangzhou is among those maintained by both sides, for example, with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic strength as the whole of Hessen.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of €250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "pushing the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was delivered to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter today proved hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a message today.
We're all holding our thumbs up.
Her mother was hospitalized at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately sedated them and kept them under close observation until they were more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners which will be sold from today onwards.
Similar to fridges and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 on which, at a glance, the buyer can detect central data such as the device's energy efficiency.
More stringent nitrogen oxide levels apply to new cars in the pollutant class "Euro 6."
There is also more money for the scaffolding farmers: They receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided cause, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was first founded as a justin.tv three years ago, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravery pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to one insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which better-wishers give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a little bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't come about as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sport rather than watch it, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes watching others at play rather than taking control console into their own hands.
It is one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning while she slips through Resident Evil and something quite different, watching a spinner shoot him in the head 20 times after each other in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the eye can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs into which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But until a game or humor virtuoso is present, its twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch simply could have swallowed up.
But Twitch has something every company would like: Thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, nor even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
On the hill castle at the Burggartenfest some things were going on on Saturday evening.
The concept of the organisers agreed.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the admission had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes of its own anyway.
That was evident early Saturday, when the first visitors turned up to the Open Air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the shelters on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and wider surroundings, had made it comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wiped off with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were tense.
And that across the generations.
While the one was lying on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others were labouring on a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the offspring raced on the hillside, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But even at the children's schminken, the volunteers literally had all their hands to do to become the Andrang Lord and to enchant fanciful creations into the small faces.
The larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop set up by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he prayed to the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and drying.
But the festival's appeal didn't do that a demolition.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
That is why there is nothing to prevent a repeat of the big party in the coming year.
Although work has yet to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in an initial assessment on Sunday against the popular vote.
He was annoyed that, in the meantime, the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some of those who had already paid did not return to the premises.
The resonance was very good.
In an initial cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who gathered in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks' n 'Rox therefore broke their performance unnerved.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire pane.
"But next year they will be there," the organiser said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than successful from the visitor numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes, which will be delayed the first time but which will have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Organisers also need to mount criticism on Facebook's social network.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately you took over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems quite as narrowly.
I think it is very good that some people not only quit stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off! "Writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organisers have one year to put a stop to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-stand component is waiting to be inserted into the striking construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Nearly 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the hull, the so-called radar, is being completely renewed.
The new radar will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size, though, still remains world record.
The final step to completing the new case is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken off with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather plays along, the action is due to take over at the start of this week.
Participants in the Ice Bucket Challenge frenzied Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully away.
A woman has been hospitalised after she cried so much during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she stretched out the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain circulated so much when her icy water was poured over her head that it injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing the act, my jaw just stayed standing," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to shut my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was haunted, and then I understood that something didn't agree.
My mother and sister saw this too and made themselves almost into the pants before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Britain was hospitalised for recovering the jaw after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon be pulling together again?
At the end of the day, there was always kennel between the two Wolfratshauser castles.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.
So far, the positions on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauss Castle and the possible reconstruction have seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: Talks are about to be held on a common course of action.
The association boards Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," Sjöberg reported.
In his view, all members of both clubs could once again pull together in the future.
In this way, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "exploration and experience" of the area is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own data.
Since Dimbaths's death, he has been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is due to be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the association counts around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let club activities rest out of respect." This "thought phase" was necessary to "consider how it might continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also take a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is not yet a candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The wolf wanted to work on the project "but very much liked to continue."
The different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
They are a tourist magnet thanks to the high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I, too, was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward. "A" unique "feature for the river city could be created.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"Personally, therefore, I do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the castle club may be moving on this point.
Their goal of documenting history at first "is important and good."
After that, you could see on.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Because the cost of university textbooks is more than $1,000 a year for many students, fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever austerity idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave out $120.
The Collective shared that, on average, students spend more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study material, but that there would be various cost-mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book a semester long, often at a far cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, shared that the rent of text books had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books were hired in college bookstores last spring, Neebo's vice president, Tevor Meyer, said.
Fewer than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price they are to have in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler cost nearly $290, but can be obtained at the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy needed
If you don't make up the notes of other or normal usage tracks, second-hand books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors whether previous spending was permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for second-hand books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
A student, for example, could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the business at which you are renting, as well as the criminal charges that may apply to writing notes, underwriting or using tracks.
Tenants careful: If you don't return the book, the criminal charges can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books, rather than traditional textbooks, are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto hired by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says students in literary courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination on books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually stock.
That lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why 'Guardians of the Galaxy' became no cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" featured just $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape," tailored to Cameron Diaz, raised just $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon Things easily made 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "dragon threads easily made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
In the case of films for a slightly older audience, however, it seems that the quality of the films isn't necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for every summer film launch shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year, to at least 2,000 canvases.
The findings are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics, and suggest this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators think the trend is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-released jungle book film, told The Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently reported sales of streaming content totalling $1.2 billion, almost double last year, in which sales were $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on films of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to potential cash raids expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema box office ever, and no one will worry about the business any more."
When, a few years ago, the 2nd table tennis district class was removed to tighten the leagues division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
As a result, those who have not risen have descended.
So, while Göttingen's class-highest team has avoided Torpedo's descent in the upper league release, it is playing only five-over-par in the upcoming season.
Fourth-class torpedoes remain ladies, despite their grandiose passing into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lengler and the Torpedo reserve enter the new Bundesliga, there are no longer any Göttingen clubs in the Bundesliga.
Among the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the association league, the Torpedo second in the state league.
What looks like a better district class is now the new Southern District League.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC compete.
In the district league play as regional representative Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the Ladies starts at least in scoring strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with us.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II is still starting - is not complete either.
Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV enter the season in a district class.
In the first season of the newly established regiment association, the two Göttingen roundabouts start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East Staffel.
The Ladies' League consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no more ladies teams at the circle level.
Striking that none of the six 2nd round classes reaches set strength, here the innovative and moving circular board will have to worry about.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There have been protests over the weekend from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, around 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and talking to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
Two youthful bushmen were brought to safety with the rope winds after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man broke up on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called police at about 8pm when the two had not returned home.
An addiction rupture from local police and emergency services broke up and the pair were found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11pm.
The girl had injured herself on the knee and the man had fallen and had struck his head.
Rescue workers remained with the couple overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were hospitalized in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The roughly 1000 protesters had been pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Deaths or injuries have not been reported.
Protesters are calling for the resignation of the leader, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said that around one kilometre away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, clashes with security forces were resumed on Monday.
According to hospital records, a policeman was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to penetrate Sharif's residence.
They are calling for the resignation of the prime minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting at the army headquarters, "without wasting time and without using force."
The communication also said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has fueled concern about a military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
Protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif rejects resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to stay out.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed similar sentiments.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the general election last May by fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially walked out peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called them over the weekend to invade Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after a second season victory at number three of the table.
With the 2-0 win over Grödig, Rapid took a bitter week on Sunday to a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a stopover with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third with green-white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Victory Road with his second season victory showing the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the country game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixth nerve in the 14th minute, set the course for victory.
"I've thought to myself, I hau clean up all the frustration from Thursday and snapped him under the lap," the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel hit 13th Novmember 2010 for the last time so far in a Bundesligapartie, that was still for Ried.
The first championship match in the Rapid Dress will therefore be remembered in a special way.
"For me, that's something very special, I'm out of the Rapid offspring," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pool blessings, Schrammel returned from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise that position mirrored.
He's earned the goal, he's already done some assists this year, "Barisic praised.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2-0 by Hofmann after well over an hour that finally brought the decision.
After all, the guests could have written before that.
"Thank goodness we have had some luck today," noted Schrammel, who thus alluded to the breakup of performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playful has always been good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
So the first three-point lead since 26 July proved that despite the setbacks, the team structure was intact: "Today my team showed that it has character."
No less pleasing for him: "That we've finally played to zero again."
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have suffered several outages during the country's game and that Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debut makes the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," recalled Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The country game break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and inflict a bit in the physical area," explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One who probably finds the break particularly convenient is Captain Hofmann.
He's crying for the crew, going over in pain.
Right at this serious stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his interception in the 68th minute not only the structure but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350 Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 over Admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point happiness must come back to us as well.
Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.
However, he cautioned on concentrated further work: "You can't always see this in black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as that has been portrayed.
We must not, however, believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me at certain stages, "Hofmann said.
Val-Coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick hit "out of the Wizard category," as well as the regular goal from Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referees.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not specific enough towards Tor at some stage.
We have had too few qualifications here.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner looked similar: "It started equally badly, but then we just found it and even made a goal.
By and large, more would have been in it.
Under this perch, Ruh reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece from Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees still exist in the county, the specimen pictured is the "Scourge Wheel" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It goes past coppings, basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks at the natural monument, it rains beyond the other trees in the surrounding area and recalls an American mammoth tree with a size of over eight metres.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive research, there were only hints of the nominee's arrival.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of things it has with the courtship.
The result of his enquiries remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat brains were supposed to have driven their animals from underwater fountains to the painstakingly roasted meadows liberated from stones.
At the foot of the tree, those exhausted by the ascent are said to have rested themselves.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows there are actually goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further identified.
When entering the stone collections, however, caution should be taken, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for cross-otters.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are signposted, which go up towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where does the water castle stand?
However, a water castle, which is being sought at our next task, is rather rare in height.
The mirroring in the tomb gives a good impression of the building, but in the county we have some historical buildings to which the building counter fei could fit.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's prime minister and current EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, pushed against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week to nominate his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU foreign policy, to succeed Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-affiliated daily La Repubblica reproduces, the appointment of Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to keep quiet about the leftist party base that has repeatedly revolted against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it, albeit more moderately.
As far as the conservative representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council are concerned, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, is concerned, so that a political balance can be struck.
The EU's chief diplomat will, at the same time, become the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Juncker.
The remaining approval of the European Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41st-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that the Mogherini, which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for its ambition, will rise to the "enormous challenges."
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with a doctorate in Politologist in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Czeratici di Sinistra (left-wing Democrats), which joined the Catholic Centre Party of Margherita in 2008 as today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the party council of the left-wing Democrats, she rose into high party politics, working in the foreign policy department, whose leader she soon became.
She occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, cultivated contacts with the socialists in Europe and with the democrats in the US.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Premier in February 2014, he advised Mogherini to become his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a stake in it.
The allegations in Brussels that the new EU external envoy has too little diplomatic experience, so lacks substance, are contested in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, suspiciously realistic accents are being pursued by Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine and slammed as a "Russia-friendly course."
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow on her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to attend a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people began their training at EMZ-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees are employed in four training professions: Electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel sorority-free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended primary and middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages, as well as instructors, go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full day hike and rafting are on the programme at the Inn.
The company has 435 employees worldwide and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of apprentices distributed across all vintages is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," Francois Hollande's main ally said.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has encountered disapproval among the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said at large applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France's controversial 35-hour week despite fierce calls for an easing of the arrangement from Emmanuel Macrons, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow Socialists to show "unity" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice secretary, sprinted sand into the gear in which she appeared at a meeting of breakaway socialist MPs, criticizing the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists "constant trench struggles, saying that she could not imagine the new Valls government going through for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the fall or winter," Fräulein Le Pen said to supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident to emerge as a winner in early elections and was ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in May's EU elections.
A poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for opportunity, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise ship provider, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships, as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end fruitlessly.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 per cent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue stood at $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry as a whole stands at about $29 billion and in the next few years is expected for them due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise ship suppliers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators for the stock exchange in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder at the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise originated in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise ship supplier owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went on the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of its shares in late June, according to approval authorities, Apollo 20 percent of its shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise collectively own 82 per cent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises' stock exchange.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after election decision
A peking faithful group swung near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first get the majority support of a nominating committee, which is expected to be filled with peking members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to face their threat and, with "Occupy Central" protests, paralyze Hong Kong's financial square.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that calls for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and Vice-Director of the Office of Hong Kong Affairs and Macao of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the course of the day.
Student activists announced plans to gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership's office in the afternoon.
Britain did not have any democratic elements until the end of Hong Kong's 150-year colonial government.
Putin demands Kiev start 'statehood talks' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government is halting fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately embarking on negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, which is under the control of the separatists, would become a part of Russia, but that its status vis-à-vis Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago: Help for the separatists in taking territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia, rather than with the West.
In an interview with state TV channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for recapturing the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately called the captured territory "Novorossija" or "Neurusland," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of campaigns by Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in areas held by separatists, hope early peace talks are "trapped in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in context with the greater autonomy discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it's about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's clarification of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period yielded a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
Autonomy, raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give Ukraine's regional governments authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area linking Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of Russia's navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
During his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further advance by rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of Nowoasowsk in the handover dispute, which is the first step of a campaign to take the strategic coastal region to Crimea, according to Ukrainian security officials.
That is why massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with a population of 500,000, which lies between Novoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine's territory.
The EU summit decided no concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colonists and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian incursion into Ilowajsk were exchanged Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko told reporters on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal surrounding Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger at hackers who presumably stole nude images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence emerged in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities on the internet.
The hacker arguably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "the tribute of panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer-songwriter Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were reportedly also publishing private photos due to an icloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who loaned himself with Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected felt "hurt."
The hacker presumably took 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lay above without being in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were unavailable for comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence 'said to TMZ: "It is an abhorrent violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "To post hacked images from a cellphone is nothing other than selling hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg yesterday, thus supporting the association "Help for Cancer Children."
The tour, which was for one torture, provided an easy workout for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski is likely to have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberurseler Brauhaus took the bike to Feldberg yesterday.
For good purpose.
He can easily put the little muscle cater away there, especially as the participation in the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) also brought him a valuable insight in person.
A great thing.
'i know now that I can do this - prima! '
Small pockets on the way in the applause curve?
Nee, if I had stopped, weir's been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants crumbled to mountains yesterday in the early tau and came close to exhaustion but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to cross the 11-kilometre stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green politician from the Kreistag - red dresses, red bikes - who appeared in red made a bit of understatement at the start ("Each lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then turned out to be a half-professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathing.
He, too, crossed the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the town of Oberursel, who had made his way along with Frank Gruneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" wasn't necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we're happy to be there - an exit we would have made today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had travelled down to Oberursel in the morning to strap back to height immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swooped into the saddle at 9 a.m. on the morning, "making" the Feldberg two times, then rolling home with fun.
Fun also had "Fritten-Toni."
For the chef of the Oberursel Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
He had whipped 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo race bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there, "Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing racer."
He's got to be that, because he's been on the "fixed bike," that's racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cordel, proved that it was even without a wheel.
Mountain guard Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team equipped with Allrad Bully and Quad, said: "The kenn" I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledge rail, just that he pulls the sledge himself. "So the man is, to some extent, his own sledge dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
Hikers first at 9.30pm.
It followed the first cyclists and runners-up at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg," gave the starting commandos and wished the participants a nice excursion.
For next year, he hopes it will succeed in blocking the route to the field mountain up to the safety of the participants.
