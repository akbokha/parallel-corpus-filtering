Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly amicable.
The two wanted to talk about implementing the international agreement as well as Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
But the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution under discussion.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-sponsored deal around Iran's nuclear program has further worsened the relationship of the two.
In March, Netanyahu had delivered a controversial speech before the US Congress at the invitation of Republicans, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the forthcoming Israeli election at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told police with a somewhat trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still live and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note kissed on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This stood out, according to authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting around 10: 18 p.m.
He said Lamb made the disastrous emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life when police saw him cordoned off.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were joking about his teaching.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal prehistory.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb had told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, saying he had any health issues.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's employment policy meant the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's notion."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing campus, police later found Lambs's lane as he drove back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents "home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to the house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He earned a doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime girlfriends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through shared friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and resident in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer vintage market three years ago.
Later, they played together the one or the other gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a Barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonic play in front of a divisive audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were on the clean-up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor who led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous people and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Students Committee.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial service, while the university's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The tuition will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the distress call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas period
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas season staff as last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people at stores and distribution centres across the country, with 45,000 workers still being hired during the 2014 Christmas period.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin application talks this month and staff numbers will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I'm a simulated guest and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," Spielberg said, "unarguably the greatest time-travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent member nations - US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He lamented that the divisions in the council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in managing the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll data showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn't (yet) worked.
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of the real estate moguls nomination.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
None claim that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at the time, in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's perseverance and starting to let their dollars flow in order to topple him.
Here are some recent survey figures suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, became the nominee.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to Republican believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively run for office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
If they put up their casual hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change since when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that point in the final cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to just 28% for final nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even as Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is diffuse to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has a 13-point lead before Carly Fiorina, ahead of Marco Rubio by 14 points, ahead of Walker by 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.
A new CBS / NYT poll released Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that and no one can really say never to change opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switching to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest rival at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign two months ago, immigration has been a hub in public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep crucial Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation effort.
But according to Monday's new ABC / Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump apparently will.
Frustration over government climbs to new highs
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for around half of the support of Republican voters, mostly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the ABC / Post's new Monday poll that they would rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with congressional Republicans, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "helplessly angered."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: Germany's five most exclusive residential areas
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt.
In the street, one square metre of a Reetdachhaus costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in what particular locations cost a square metre the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student bude in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top places of residence, however, one of the prices is like peanuts.
Real estate service provider Engel & Mitchkers has released a ranking of Germany's most exclusive residential locations - with square metre prices at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros per square metre, not to mention tens of thousands of euros per square metre.
But good who's able to afford it...
By the way: Munich, for once, is not at the top of the list.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just got a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then ran it.
A soulful start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Hexenkessel of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52nd / 90th + 2) and Götzes's hit (89th) earned with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The 12th starter in series is said to be the first step towards finals on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third innings.
Müller received amicable assistance from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto during his 28th match in the Champions League to lead Bayern, which allowed a shot of the world champion, thought to be a flank, to pass.
"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised in front of 31.688 hot-blooded fans before the match at Karaiskakis Stadium - and Munich kept word.
They showed a focused and committed notion without shining.
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) also stumbled here.
But the Bayern, undefeated in seven Europacup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran courageously, but often too inventive in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often launched by game-shifting left-back Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank struck from the right half-field in the upper left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland's head ball from the line (26th).
Then by direct take-off, goalkeeper Roberto parted with the knee (35th).
Although Bayern drew their usual dominant game, Piräu was able to set up needle stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, though, was relishing.
For example, when he pulled a shot of Ideye over the lads (56th).
Before Neuer, Guardiola left for a four-string with David Alaba at centre alongside Jerome Boateng defending it well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero did not give the green light until after the final training, Sports Board Chairman Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Anyone who wants to make something different out of it is already vicious."
Also on the first change, Guardiola opted against him when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, by elephant, Müller put one more in it.
Before the game, it had come to crawls in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly mummified Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with punches against Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured being transported from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke do not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this is what a Potsdamer lange long-term study suggests.
The good news: When waived, the risk falls quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was about 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for these parodontitis, the authors stress.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk for caries.
People who stopped smoking, though, could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham University.
Persuading people to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing told DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous research would have indicated that smoking increases the risk for early dental failure.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from late antiquity on Cologne's Rhine banks
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists at the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always used as an Archaeological Heritage Care Office.
In the third part of the Rhine boulevards the archaeologists were now found.
It had already been known from text documents that in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century there was a church, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with some 350 tombs had also been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman is injured at the train station in ­ Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police are asking the population for help.
At around 1.40am early Wednesday morning, the woman crossed the tracks from towards the station building coming at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from towards Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she sustained most serious injuries from it, according to federal police.
She was given emergency treatment on the ground and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
There is no evidence of the reason for the young woman's night rail crossing.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) come into question.
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided under the 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police under telephone 0800 / 6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic FTA TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more traditional in its operation.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade area, with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide specifically for the EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come equally from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time there will also be a second instance.
It would allow appeals to be made against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed with each other on the basis of referees, and there has been no possibility of objecting to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court, according to its own data.
It would then be possible, for example, to resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS), particularly demanded by large corporations, are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice over which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
In particular, criticism has been levelled that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel drew up with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the opportunities for the economy to take action by way of too many new rules.
This could put small and medium-sized enterprises in particular at a disadvantage, it said.
When talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be in place as early as the end of this year.
This date is considered untenable any more.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens's talk.
He tells on the basis of various places he keeps on the map, about which his minuscule and tender arranged songs report.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Irishman.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear, which are harmonically very close to American folk of the late Sixties, but can always drift into the super opulent.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a denied series: Each of the 50 U.S. states should be beset in a row.
But as early as 2004 and in Rheinnah, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens occurs here.
Live suffice to him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely acclaimed masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overcrowding with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs into the American Billboard charts and is not missing from any annual best list of influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic replacements on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, however, worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Long removed from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become the colourful spectacle of neon forehead bands and large fluorescent stage deko.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the darkly held hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now seated in their chairs, the clearly more mature Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: The talk is "opulent" and you can throw the "record basically away."
Stevens thanks modestly only to an addition, plays acoustically few older songs, and eventually listens to towering applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Questions has been eagerly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, joining David Cameron for the first time.
MR Corbyn will rise to face the first of his six set questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs from close range.
He called for "fewer theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some meetings to let them be colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the Tuc annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the sinking of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
MR Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and limits on profits.
MR Corbyn told the Tuc conference that Labour is putting forward changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since becoming Tory leader over the last decade across the Dispatch box in Parliament.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "clamping down" and stretching with reluctance, and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
MR Corbyn has said Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak, and that he had approached John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theatre" often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later admitted he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister has been seen as the most important barometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued it has become a caricature and calls for far-reaching reforms.
'shot in Joburg ': Homeless youngsters to photographers trained
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place to be when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge (er)) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youngsters how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises due to accelerated UK wage growth
The pound jumped after data showing a rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings excluding bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
That percentage was the fastest since 2009 and yielded estimates of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20% jump after takeover offer from rival AB InBev was received.
A deal would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemon's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% drop after Goldman Sachs put its valuation for the company's rating on "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half year.
The boss of JD Sports says higher wages put expansion at risk.
Managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But that purchasing power is unlikely to offset the higher labor costs at his firm, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
Crippling 21 years young, a hammering with upper-slip frise.
The type with platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And generation U17 is turning through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the polish sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Construction: Her idol, whose poster hangs in Szczecin, has been living here since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much on the day as her mum Ewa earns in the half year.
If anything.
The says: "Actually, my wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymnasium."
'i'm fulfilling her a dream.'
School duty?
Who's cheering?
The fans don't.
Nor does Bieber himself.
That sort of thing worked out anyway.
For the publicity in the Superbowl's promotional break, he cashed in three million, a two-year deal with an anti-picket company splashing many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber also cares.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the window screen.
He is said to have exploited more than 100 million.
Some say the hype is going too far.
Others stress that Bieber is in first place in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many nobles at first.
At least he does.
Pegida poster puts Lebanese on potato döner idea
Potatoes or döners?
It goes both ways - in the potato döner developed by Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the splurge of "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spider.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue mirror has been rotating in his shop, stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," Alhay thinks.
The idea has since been introduced to the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility.
How much meat and how much potatoes the spike contains, Alhay therefore doesn't want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the international community is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground stewardship campaign to combat Aldi- intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi surge in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-breaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough distributing samples at IGA stores and shoppers selling illicit tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared with around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snap away about five per cent of the grocery market in these two states 12 months after it opens its first markets, taking away sales to all existing players but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
That forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley accepts that Metcash's sales in the food and grocery business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member made contact with Mr Douglass last week.
IGAS's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery retailer, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction while putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is hurting and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week, and to help IGA retailers improve their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's chief executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will go to Elan and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association, Steve Healy deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," got into the spotlight by Kyrgios' infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios and I should have beat the kid."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a tie thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite eager about is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was dragged a little bit into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racquet when he lost because of a tie in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even in the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around and I think he's been treated a little too strictly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the changing area, he trains hard, he's good in form, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios at the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, describing the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term permanent part of the team. "
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies round [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick very quickly managed to rise to what people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's rising in the eyes of the public, and he's made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions; some time outside the spotlight where he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate and the team is best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, keeping everyone who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter swooped above them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" And shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some withdrew food and water from protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in outlawed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency struck on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic migrants who are looking for a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, which laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to give procedural approval to the deployment of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border day after day.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pressed a crowd to squeeze in there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halves
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, gets support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the primaries begin, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed on which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more steady in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but those caucuses have narrowed.
Their support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is down just 5 points here.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton still has a big lead among older voters, however.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead with that group.
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current backers are mostly excited about her.
The views are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When asked by Clinton's supporters in an open question why they want her to be the nominee, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned by Clinton's supporters.
Consent to the handling of the problems and the eligibility to vote is also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential presidential ballot, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries want to see him in the race - though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be her second choice far ahead of Sanders.
Choosing Biden not to run for the Democratic nomination increases Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that number dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most electable" has risen.
Still, when asked what's more important with a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.
Much like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters of the primaries stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates are delivering good results with some key features among voters of their party's primaries.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs best at honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him on that.
Democratic voters in the primaries generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
By all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions remain about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, though 36 percent said their opinion of her had deteriorated.
It's mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen by her party's voters as honest and trustworthy, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide also view Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut best with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson polls close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support growing by 27% in Tuesday's poll, up from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month.
But Carson shot up from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson performs well among demographic groups, outpacing Trump among Republican voters with college education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is sidelined with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen furthest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people by Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or Minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN / ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson is rising in the polls - landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hiding for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Nearly two years after a student passed away during a bullying ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York-based Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to approach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then fell conscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide Utensilia and fundamentally put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, fuselage and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by the Brotherhood's harassment, with at least one student dying of harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held to account, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended an indictment of murdering third graders for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of harassing and forming a criminal association.
"We not only want to hold the individuals involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
That will happen when the Fed raises rates
A rate hike is coming, and the house rate will fall, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
So US central bank officials have emphasized so fiercely that investors should focus not on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated because of a rate hike.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of 'cheap money'," Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a communication to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still to low levels, to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean there will be no impact.
Here's a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market saw last month, anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency for asset yields to be depreciated 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed rate hikes.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on the upward trajectory - about 14 per cent - on its way to the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 per cent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on equities tends to occur later in the increases cycle and the yield is starting to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely noteworthy that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rate hikes since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question of "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants got caught all year on a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading gives only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles have taken place from 1950 to the present day in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, and pre-recession levels have been shaken up very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report said.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, and this is 74 months to date.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate hike, and the pattern is pretty much the same as in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on equities when they change their strategic course.
On bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to move closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often yield better in such a climate, although "we are still cautious to expect higher yields," Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," they wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, borrowing margins have expanded and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as financing their debts.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have surpassed firms with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also surpassed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) each.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside purely equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains through higher returns, though experts differ on how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP criticised broadcaster for his' dumb'
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also cited the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice, saying this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claiming a leading member of parliament and increasing new pressure on the broadcaster to prove he is doing something private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was "stupid" and increasingly undistinct from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" stupid "- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appear to be The Brits just under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you're actually just mimicking what's already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3 is that I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and music that's really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and commissioning new works also seems to me to be really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work needed to be done to engage audiences than it did in the past because Britons are less aware of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing at the Culture, Media and Sport select committee for putting commercial rivals on their feet.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted the BBC 1 show - featuring Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was "produced in a special BBC way."
He added he would like the company to "find a hit from our in-house stable" when it launches an entertainment series the next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money of fee payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose at the slowest pace in August and Black Friday may be to blame
There was a seven per cent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe Black Friday has slashed spending in November
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 then that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when shoppers began making purchases with their phones.
It meant more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now that is coming to an end, and we may see growth diminishing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe buyers are holding back their purchases ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rushed around their computers to make their bargains, and some retailer websites crashed.
Experts believe Black Friday, on which buyers struggled because of bargains, could discourage buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 spending a little more than £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the modekettes in inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mecca in crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia places burden on collapse partly of giant Saudi Bin Laden group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mekka's grand mosque.
Mourning filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession moved ahead at the Holy Site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the begging.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the Bin Laden family's construction company because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 Bears who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsch at the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Haddsh will continue into Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have been stealing the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, released by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was complicit in the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report that detail, but said the company's leadership banned foreign travel.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsh, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue statements about the collapse of de Krans, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also impacted the group because of non-current security measures and because it had not cooperated with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mekka's grand mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is taking on major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a breakaway son who was expropriated from the family in the 1990 "s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount paid to permanently injured people.
Other injured people get half that amount.
B & Q boss says time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen.
That leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent to the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen to carry out the works in their home
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to belong to a minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out homework jobs in their homes, according to the company's chief executive behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the construction markets chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices had now been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B & Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, as eight out of ten purchase decisions at the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men outnumber the staff.
She said it was necessary to confront growing demographic trends that feature more female single households making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 per cent of decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed leading corporation in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have filled exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and finance board.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and sales after the group blamed the cost of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich / Dob officials jailed for infidelity in court
At Klagenfurt Regional Court on Wednesday, two officials of Austria's Vice-Master of Volleyball Aich / Dob had to answer for infidelity and evasion.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used money from association accounts, through which they were allowed to dispense in their functions, for private purposes, between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated to be around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
The chairwoman of the opening Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin, dismissed this fact.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
To dismiss the infidelity, the defence stated that the association had not at any time suffered an asset disadvantage.
Sports officials would only have charged expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they would have invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the Passiva amounted to around 600,000 shillings (approximately 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At the time, we were facing the situation: Are we continuing to run the club or are we blocking it?" One of the defendants told, in the Financial Office's bread shop.
With his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We raised money, hinged on our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the intake.
The association has agreed: They can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
Furthermore, in the event of an appropriate financial success, the payment of the expenses compensation would have been decided retroactively until 1991.
As a result, some of the expenses were paid out only years later, from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, even flat-rate and not detailed bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in detail in financial management, but only debt-free, according to the answer.
When an official began investigations for abuse of office in 2011, a sum of €120,000 was transferred to the club's account.
Those were resignations, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" The judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondent did not know the answer.
He then eventually said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything of that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-accused had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "refund of damages."
Why compensation?, judges and prosecutors wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With that you're all out of the tailoring."
"Am I a legal representative?" He asked.
Further, the official said he had never received a cent salary, charged only mileage and diets.
On diets, he had charged the club €1,000 a month, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
Accurate records for the early years could not show the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an operating audit in which everything had been judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also been charged mileage.
All arrangements were made in cash, and he had to travel from his place of residence to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the workforce reduction that has been going on for three years, the company will cut further jobs.
There is no end to the postponements with the US-based Hewlett-Packard (HP).
As part of its restructuring, the US technology company plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This is intended to save costs of $2.7bn (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special burden of around $2.7bn, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been going on for three years, has not yet been completed.
HP still employed about 302,000 people at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year.
Afterward, Hewlett-Packard shares surged 2.3 percent.
The printing company from Palo Alto, California, is currently split: This is how the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separate from the more promising sectors with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both sections of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Once again disappointing PC sales as well as weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer finally moved to Lenovo.
Sales of PC and printers declined 11.5 percent in the third quarter to the end of July.
Revenue fell 8 per cent to just under $25.4bn.
As a result, the proceeds declined in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, only responded late in the day to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more stores equally online.
All in all, Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the removal of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: Majority support anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq, however, would be overwhelmingly opposed: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria finds 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of respondents, 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent could not choose.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected self-driving cars and electromobility until 27 September.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence at Serb-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water cannons against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the police officers a water cannon was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles, according to officials.
Officials initially uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas has been spilled toward the refugees.
That disbanded the group.
The refugees have now retired somewhat warily.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sacked in themselves together and suffered breathing problems.
Serbian police press officers also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the Federal Reserve
The world watches when the Federal Reserve meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who still felt last week that the Fed was going to do so now thinks the Fed will persist for a little longer, keeping interest rates at their current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, lead employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global relations.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 8pm CET on Thursday
Death row student at Delta State University left behind apology letter
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it made him "feel sorry" at the first murder and wanted "he could unlock it," authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at about 10: 00 on Monday morning.
And said he had shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff at the emergency call centre that police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house but that "nobody is going to bother" but will probably be excited.
Police asked the caller for his name, but did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
As police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. ""
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before eventually taking his own life Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's notion."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities on Tuesday said there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "destroyed at the ground."
He said Prentiss's daughter was "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said
Police said Lamb had called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he won't go to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a gunshot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as indicated by his likeness on the university's website.
Stars who lost their fortune
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds Group
Lufthansa is planning a major concert building.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the approximately 1000 executives worldwide will cost the company the job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and valuing low-cost Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was an earnings contribution of around €500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the board team around Chef Carsten Spohr.
With its new design, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organisation of the 120 000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of annual sales of €30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
Negotiations are due to resume in the collective bargaining dispute with the pilot association Cockpit (VC) following the court-halted strike this Thursday.
That was shared by the union.
The issue of the talks is supposed to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wanted to achieve sustainable results "in a year with a projected record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transition supply of the pilots, the "Wings" savings concept is the background.
Lufthansa is expected to outsource routes to the group's low-cost Eurowings line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this will put the left-handed outside defender to weep and exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw collapsed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the changing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture then that takes six months and he's not going to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of an elephant.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee had been mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elephant and a red card were due.
It was a very worse attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages, words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer loss to Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has an added incentive to rest with the European Championship in France until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When a player with that kind of injury leaves the place, everyone's very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing himself very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear then that it's a very serious injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me, it wasn't possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Talking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it; I am so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost extensively.
Unless you're maybe David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr Seuss's 1971 environmental faint.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or message we've missed so far."
All well and good, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's plot, instead reproduces a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to broaden the rather brief original text.
"In the midst of the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads.
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the surrounding town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, where an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is spoiled by the monetary-greedy, trees-folding, Thneed-stripping once ler despite the protests of naming Lorax, a hooking, cunning being "who speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who didn't read The Lorax 20 times consecutively to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text had likely come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff but gave no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened from exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the cadaver England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out a standout victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting standings, and the community spirit is strong; they won't bear scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball developing, Moeen Ali as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at Test level, is an option for attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to let out Adam Lyth, of course, is hard for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, to analyse.
There have been two good attacks in difficult conditions in his seven Tests, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selectors.
Long ago, one would have extended Lyth's run, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hopefully takes further runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man in particular.
The question of how much time a Test drummer is given to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - as did Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only charge that can be levelled was that England first set up Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a drummer I value highly.
He's an X-factor cricket player what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us a lot.
He needs to get at least the same chances as the one before him, but this obviously depends on team-building in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook, which would yield an extra-spin bowler and receive four Quicks, emerged and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a drummer can't beat there and this left-handed man has already shown he is a vicious scout of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his Worcestershire County job, but is he a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference there.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before stepping up as an Opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadaver as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me greatly as a young man.
People might look at his statistics - averaging 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there's not a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He's going to learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England have made a few clever additions at the trainer's desk.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as an adviser to the Test matches could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the game's nicest guys who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup.
I've always felt he's created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly's team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not deployed at the One Dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some won't agree, but coaches and team-goers don't determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain traction if the economy gets into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's ill-fated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will run deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of ingenious Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the Tuc, who became fiercely divided because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is, and not always by their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-created agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly do not want.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided at their annual assembly that it doesn't like these either if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and finance minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Lass us not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it looks bad for her, as happened with the overly long-standing like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks ahead to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a leftist.
It is hard to imagine that they will tear themselves off a leg to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they also don't want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So perhaps some such ministers are even intentionally planning unhelpful comments, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Britain won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense, and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2-1 ratio.
You can remember weakly Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
With all his frenzy, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-Indians who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that when you're sitting with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum swirl, because Blair had put the principle above the EU's unpassed constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which thus opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly piano on his back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer needed time for me to waste - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80's, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I put it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional leaf arbine tendency and the wilder gefilds of Torys Klein-Engländerism may well say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, as the Scout campaigned in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father struggled on television to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay "in all circumstances" - Benns's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MPs and deputies, according to all reports at their small-town meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to not give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to take for granted Labour's support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of little difference is a central principle of dogmatic dispute.
As with his ambiguities on Nato - Tom Watson is rock-solid convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, in part with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the "principle report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE established its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have questioned whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for a multiple-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage from various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors are said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco Fund (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he is alleged to have received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the board's members will not be delivered, but that include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also specify industry funding in the paper.
Some other attendees at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco management also attended the meeting.
The group's research "acknowledges, significantly," that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there has been no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ's claims had already been responded to beforehand.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proof and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £2bn a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public service programmes, likely seen by a smaller audience, in hard-fought timelines against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast, which would also clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the upper house communications committee as part of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, your production should at least be based on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to get the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax is funding programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give her right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-service television.
I don't think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that aired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows such as Eastenders.
Johnson said the more public niche programmes "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees," Now, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that no one has seen. "
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think you get great value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky- and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC's production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example on public broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this in "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said showed only a handful on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the Nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny Nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on the subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled neematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microflies and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to temporarily make the cited human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Ads shatter Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Show Video
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint smashing leg ropes!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shooters that cause tortuous pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to spotlight the British government's willingness to spare arms to repressive regimes via Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on subway trains, requiring a second look.
"Important announcement: Drive with DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the London Underground characters and the hallmarks of the DLR line, which turns to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride with DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Inbus keys that it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stops advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this pokatier "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists take to work with activists within protest movements, noting that they need to move outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trading posters greets commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works nonprofit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms fair - through a blanket of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic weighty corporate advertisement, but "by blending in with bright colours and animation, it remains stronger liable."
"They've done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the field within ExCeL, where exhibitors marry fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army about "the AT4CS RS discarded by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battle head that delivers outstanding post-action effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still in the belief of Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I bothered - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Entering student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to swatch: People tell you where you came from, whether and where you took sabbatical year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite neither love nor hate you because in gravity, guys, it's just a yeast extract hahahaha, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It steals the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your Wimpern came under fire and those fire extinguishers would be.
Leave people.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and communal meeting points, but they're also the places where people get up and right their underwear.

Introverted get rough treatment at university
Your room should be a refuge, yet many student homes form a space-to-space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interacting with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of sociability is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking on it.
Apropos knock on: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
As you start the uni at the height of the back mania, the closet at the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I've baked you something, so, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friendships.
Your fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and will, in the end, perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Poorly mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to get sleeping when you knock on.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clapping chicken is a theft, but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea, too?
Check that with the dairy owner.
Chances stand well, they say, of serving themselves, even as they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it in a more balanced way than my fellow residents, who added a dishwasher to their milk to punish thieves.
She is now in jail.
You shouldn't make a noise that discourages people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that, in the truest sense of the saying, you are among the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbours if it makes them something to put drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before ploughing her own music, closing her door and coming to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student home?
Conversely, would it not be downright embarrassing for you to be a co-resident for your future spouse, to stand up to her, to separate and then see her every day, and perhaps to witness all the friends she brings to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow definitely isn't your future spouse, at least try to make a little sense to your underdog.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his unlocked room, the boundary between an Ulk and bullying is more fine than it seems.
A good stretch is funny, but it only takes moments for him to boomerang.
Give by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never conceal someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't set your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in the central Franconian corner valley for people who don't have much money.
So for refugees, for example - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing, but so do the single mother and the low earner."
"I show how you can still build favorably and well today," the 44-year-old says in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how to quickly create affordable housing: He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gym halls has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing over the next few decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six homes just built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that a lot of refugees will say it's peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to their respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house is 184 000 euros, with no plot.
That's manageable.
Construction has lasted six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have completed my project correctly.
It is always particularly complicated by the threat of Damocles sword special construction and the pitch regulation.
Gruseful.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities do they lack the space to do so.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which definitely isn't true.
But don't you exacerbate the competitive struggle for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we've had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years, but built luxury apartments that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message that ordinary people also need housing.
Not only refugees, but also single mothers or low earners.
I show how you can still build favorably and well today.
That is what this is all about.

Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, typing on "General" and then choosing "Software Update."
If it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some encountered problems after the installation because they received an error message indicating that the "software update failed."
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to upgrade via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
That may mean deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update, as well as making it easier to do so when using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is close to a charger, so the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't allow the update to continue, as the phone may be switched off halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack."
The World Cup second-round pick stressed before starting in the crucial seven overseas races "that I have nothing left to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion from title contenders and two-time champion Hamilton in Singapore this Sunday.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous 12 season races and is also tackling the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will affect the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear.
For days, a Dunstbell has been hanging above the city, sparked by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
Founded three months ago, the chess club "Chess Friends Bad Kissingen" has added another member to its ranks, increasing the number of members to 19.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 years.
Gauselmann is bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that was received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward.
Gauselmann wants membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" to be seen as an expression of his association with the spa city.
Quartiersoffice seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Antenzentrum Antonistift have teamed up under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one-stop shop at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More precisely to Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new Quartiersbüro was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, senior citizens and counsellors will now receive information on issues such as care insurance or health and care insurance services.
For years we have found, with our outpatient care service, that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Also not often many of the funds are not used because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," explained the new householder Jutta Weigand, who as Division Manager is also responsible for the Antonist and Civic Hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus."
In addition to the consultations, the new Quartiersbüro also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis were taken on board.
Therefore, you can take advantage of additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers of the Seniorenzrum and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," said Heike Riedel, Executive Director of Saludis.
Both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new Quartiersbüro in the city centre particularly as a result of demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) pointed out at the inauguration ceremonies, the Quartiersbüro also dedicates itself to the association in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite a regular sociable presence."
The Social Foundation thus makes a major contribution to ensuring that senior citizens can live as independently and as well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Quartiersbüro is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg versus Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: Since the date for the FC Eintracht Bamberg match against the third-ligist Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6 October deadline has now been set.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against third-placed FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
Will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19: 00 at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We're glad we now know when the game is over, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now-launched pre-sale ticket.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party league.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and not without reason, because flood light games have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg entered the round of the last 16 teams in 2010 by winning 1 FC Oberhaid (3: 1) and 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3: 2) at home against the regional leagues.
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB club spokesman 2016 / 2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old deceased
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He passed away as early as September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the University of Technology in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983, he was president of the Austrian Institute of Formation.
In the 1980s, he was charged with setting up the Treasury in Vienna's Hofburg and converting the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese charged policeman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese noticed unwell in Bremen
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, ex-national guard in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim is engaged, Wrestler.
He wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass added over the last two years, according to his own statement.
Intellectually, he did not object.
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the Bremen city centre when he saw a parking room guardian outside exhibit a penalty box for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw her the due fine in front of her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reported.
The city of Bremen has confirmed the allegations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," it says of the city of Bremen.
Only then will it decide whether or not to display meadow.

Men cheer on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are searching police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: At around 11.45pm on Friday evening, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to police, one from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and told them to wait for him.
At that point, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
Three people also stopped at the site of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the young man and hit him with his fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nasal burns and blew heavily from the nose.
When his two friends appealed and appealed to the thug, he initially left his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man has now been taken home.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their flat and drove demonstratively over there several times.
When you no longer saw the vehicle, the injured man walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There, he was attacked again by the thug and another male.
The victim's face and thighs were checked with the help of a headbutt.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about 1.80 feet tall.
The second thug is said to have been about 1.65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-and-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and instructors to sign up under the phone number 06181 / 100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also appreciated by Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still half-way behind his successor in the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he has invested 310,000 euros in the premises at St Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when Frank Müller and his wife, Silvia Müller-Gongoll, were met by the Felstehausens years ago, who are currently completing their specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and want to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that garbage would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it came to it, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"Proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees being his own boss soon.
And so one agreed, the garbage collectors bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time family father Frank Müller grew up there, following his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a surgeon in Sulingen, in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency physician in Diepholz County and volunteered in the DRK readiness of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The practice will be prepared for the new boss from 19 September.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a domestic physician, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as domestic doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress EKGS and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the computer system will be completely renewed.
A grant of a total of EUR 50000 will be given to the Müllers as part of a programme of support from the county (EUR 25000) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues," emphasizes velvet community surgeon Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients enter the field every quarter, with about 500 in the North German average practice.
There is another house doctor practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's takeover of practice: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, anyone who attends Müller's speaking lessons will continue to look in familiar faces: The seven medical professionals and the cleaner will take over from the rocks.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the medical practitioners practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen schmunzelnd.
They feel a little sore after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly still see many patients often," says the Internistin.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6,000-square-foot plot."
'so far I've always pushed myself in front of gardening, now that could be different '.
In addition, the couple have two grandchildren and are happy to travel.
Croatia: 'We let refugees through'
"Now border controls are also going up on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum can do so 'naturally'.
The care and security of people is paramount.
But it is also clear "that there needs to be clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migratory flows, including via the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considering "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian Government had previously indicated that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to travel further towards Austria and Germany, and that it might also erect corridors for the refugees.
That is not the case, however, with the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar, in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," but Slovenia is stepping up border surveillance, especially with regard to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must fill in his or her obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government informed us, the first refugees would have tried in the night hours of Tuesday to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik / Sid border crossing in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to take them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian Tovarnik since then.
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already in operation.
In the coming days, his country is counting on some 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees had arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has turned over, so the police have told us that we should drive here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers, to a slightly further west.
Croatia: 'Comprehensive opportunities for border control'
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
Details he did not name, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "extensive opportunities for border control."
Strict checks are being carried out to qualify for Schengen membership.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and since then the EU partners have been giving the country a good record in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the past night at Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local glance in Horgos: He considers the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Aid workers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee shelters have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not without risk: There are still uncleared mines in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into as yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information used is intended to have been used to make insider transactions in the financial markets.
That way, according to investigators, a total of more than $100 million was gaunted.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," the SEC communication states.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice assistance Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People do their worries, some quick steps, some cosy bumpy.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Auto Salon at Paradeplatz.
City railways hold.
Pulsating, crazy life with magnificent autumn sunshine and four large tables in the middle of it each with the headline "Before I want to die...."
Ecumenical hospice assistance drew attention with this action to its 20th anniversary and is certainly facing mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The manager of Ecumenical hospice assistance is at the disposal of the passers-by as well as the volunteers for questions and discussions.
While some may spontaneously take a passer-by to the chalk and add the phrase "my life affirms," "read," "drive with the camper through the U.S.," "stop the war" or "not suffer for long," others remain short, read, say sentences like "so far am I not yet" and then go on.
On the sidelines, small discussions about the action itself evolve, about life, about how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
"Only when I realise that for me the end will come at some point in this world can I live responsibly," says the director of the diaconic plant Mannheim, which together with the Caritasverband is the owner of the Ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
It is understandable, however, that not everyone wants to communicate themselves publicly on the tables, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although it is precisely the hospice movement that has contributed a great deal in recent years to people opening up.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The dying and mourning companion is one of the first hour's volunteer staff.
Confronted with the subject by personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical hospice was seeking honorary officials by appeal, she immediately registered and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorary officers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in hospice St Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task well and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see life from another waiting, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and clubs enables the training and training and supervisions of the companions of death and grief.
Training courses for new employees are offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display at the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and at the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Even there, other personal wishes can be listed on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook for 2016 cut
FedEx reported disappointing results for the final quarter, and the berth giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The firm also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
Shares fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than at the earlier forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite price hikes averaging 4.9 per cent and effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground shipments of heavy and large packages being levied from November.
The company said it nonetheless expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and because of growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "delivering solid earnings considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share forecast 12 of Zacks Investment Research surveyed analysts predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has seen sales in its Express shipping unit stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
Sales at ground transportation rose 29 percent last quarter, but operating earnings were basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while earnings fell because of higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey sitting hall is a wall image of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: Maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it, it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being disenchanted from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
While most of the economy's data shows it is growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make Fed officials already cautious about amplifying that volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - if only by a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself disguises the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect a Fed wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
That suggests a decline in the stock market should the Fed raise the rate unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The action was prompted by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to lift rates at this stage, "he said.
If it does, "it would have to go a long way in its statement to reassure financial markets not to panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expects an increase in the rate this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market this year has been solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was steadily below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world poured together late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would drown global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below May's high.
For Fed officials, market turmoil is influencing the complex calculation of when to raise rates.
"If events in financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last couple of weeks, they would attract the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere suggestion by then-head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow down" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are not linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee who is campaigning for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited discernible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are ramping up," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown

Even if the store is well attended, it's not hard to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving you a warm welcome cannot be achieved without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a whole range of people in Hoyerswerda who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Street.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organisation SPRS is shockingly trying to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding; it is doing so by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sportthalle
The local council of Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for solar installation.
Planning for the long-awaited turnroom construction at the Bernrieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the most recent local council meeting, the drawn-out construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the Board had decided, among other things, on a request for an "exception" or "exemption" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was to grant permission for a special form of roof construction.
Therefore, a "saddle roof with non-mittem first and roof overhead" is to be erected.
Background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof tilt, which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons, contrary to what was prescribed in the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was needed because the construction plan does not allow "exemptions" in terms of roof inclination - the Bernrieder Municipal Council is usually more restrictive when applying for exemptions.
Turnhallenbau, however, is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent with this," Steigenberger said.
The gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the Municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around EUR 2.3 million in costs are calculated.
Grants are expected from school and latitude sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Land Council Office for examination.
Peißenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is due to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of staff move from Peißenberg with to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the District, as confirmed by Councillor Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg would be further employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station.
The rooms were there.
Employees who cannot travel to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-White.
Staff were informed of the plans.
The change prompted the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-White, the name "Fischer," who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team, came into play on the question of who should take the succession.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case meant an "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "Internal Medicine," according to Jochner-White.
Fischer specializes in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer will lead both houses with his team, until next year the former hospital of the scarlets, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing refurbishment at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal scarcity, would in future be used as a shelter for asylum-seekers.
"That's me excluding." As it continues with the property, Jochner-White couldn't say there were several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the caritas and a daily psychiatrist.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the lech, which had been taken "positively and very understandably" by staff.
There was no real prospect of the house where Fischer has been working as a chief farmer for more than 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been under constant threat of closure in recent decades, departments have been shut down, for example, surgery and birth support.
The handballer of the Rhine-Neckar Lions is required tonight (8: 15 p.m.) at the Bergische HC.
The Bundesliga's table leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the badgers suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and got something to make good for them.
Hunting dunk with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abernens on a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were in use, as police informed.
After a gunshot charge, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could have occurred to the accident was initially unclear.
The crime police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A crime suspect has led police to the corpse of the 16-year-old, who has been missing since Saturday, from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted killing the youths and throwing their corpse into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The corpse of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday night, as prosecutors and police said Wednesday.
A 20-year-old also arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be a tattoo suspect, who confessed to the act and led investigators to find the corpse.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she failed to arrive home the previous evening following a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, investigators initially encountered the victim's personal belongings.
When questioned in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was a suspicion of crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen where the corpse was found.
According to the arrest, authorities admitted in the police investigation to having killed the 16-year-old and placed the corpse in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to be presented to the detention tribunal on Wednesday, investigators put a death burden on him.
The purpose of the further investigation is to provide information on the closer circumstances of the act.
Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable lead.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have started a long time ago.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the association "Social Housing."
For comparison, 260,000 units are being completed in Germany this year.
That leaves 140,000 homes missing.
Refugees are no longer required to live in a first-time shelter after the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers.
Many then encounter the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of rental homes.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not just due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also makes up for significant failings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is running a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units have already been missing in the conurbations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
As a result, many professionals lived in WG rooms in major cities.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flute in the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the "Social Housing" alliance is proposing a reboot.
New incentives are to boost social housing.
In this way, the basic employment tax could be waived and the land tax on assisted housing could be suspended indefinitely.
Moreover, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation opportunities are needed.
The State Bank KfW Refugee Accommodation Programme is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been retrieved on Monday evening, with EUR 184 million.
Now the project could even be stepped up.
Refugees have free rein: Croatia and Slovenia set corridor
After Hungary, virtually no progress has been made, with more and more refugees choosing the route via Croatia.
Zagreb announces it will grant transit via Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian interior minister and, if necessary, we will organise a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the shutdown of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up into Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border at Tovarnik, Croatian television broadcaster RTL reported.
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees the previous day.
Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic declared: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at Serbia's border with the EU's neighbour Croatia in the morning.
Most came from Syria, Iran, and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came by bus as well as taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after they arrived, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip carries other dangers: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearers are now supposed to create a safe passage quickly.
However, after the closure of the border, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people picked up.
Just before gate closing on Monday, it had still been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
That is why 35 criminal proceedings have been launched in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Convicts face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the Immigration Department, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transitons" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - were most important to Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children, as well as two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees would have stopped there.
In practical terms, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Sperrgitter was dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the aim of this transformation.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was halted in the morning on instructions from German authorities.
In the open air, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove 'stranded' across border
"We were busy cleaning up after Sunday's bridge festival, when suddenly ten people stood with travel agents at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein's mayor, Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted by train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over in Wernstein for them, "says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars over the border into the area.
Before, we gave the unhoped-for guests first, with snack and drinks.
We have said straight away that we will take them by car.
"That was self-evident for us," Stadler said in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
One man did not take it upon himself to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"That made us very pleased," Stadler said.
On Sunday evening, the stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train heading for Passau, to try it over the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been halted.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the border crossing is generally high in the course.
The Brückenfest was organised by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more thousands of cigars to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping to establish structures that guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp immediately, our Chancellor has made the attitude of the Hungarian Government into the dark circle of Nazism highly official and public.
The victims of this policy are not only the Austrians, who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Poultry, too, will have to find that the "praised country" that has invited and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the ongoing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to establish humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winterproof quartz
Konrad has all of his hands to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffiron banker to set up quartiers for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got to grips with the chaos at the Traiskirchen initial reception centre.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
Accommodation for the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without a major spill, Konrad said, praising the organisational "masterstroke."
The Home Office, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation."
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quartz this year.
To meet the figure, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the lands, 15,000 of the federal government said.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already had discussions with the national leaders.
They would have assured him that they would also be able to create quarties for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," Ferry Maier said.
Former VP Mandatar supporter Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn in order to clarify how the church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Help as we do."
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
There are also hopes for hotels that will be empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high."
In emergency times, quartier lenders could not have to comply with a certain amount of towel holders or the size of the surface requirements.
"Emergency standards" would have to apply for a temporary period.
Konrad's experience explains that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation.
I am an older gentleman, to whom it is not easy to say the untruth in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier are not costing the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
So far, our own quartier search has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to put up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seem to be problems with approval.
Linz calls for better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, because people can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For the emergency, however, other locations are to be checked for their suitability.
The city chief is critical of the division of refugees within the federal government.
Other districts need to make their contribution here, too.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed"
In a lengthy phone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state Prime Minister Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday acceded to further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be closed.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, we now have the relevant border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Of the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, Austria's re-introduction of controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the German approach.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
On four of the six floors of the office and production building, the exchange-listed IT group S & T is to be brought in, the rest (2700 square metres) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try and make them work for us," says S & T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and then acquiring them.
From the very beginning S & T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
S & T invested €1.7 million in the site, €3.3 million from the TechCenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG to S & T and TechCenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
LIA Peroni owner opened second store in arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
Lia Peroni's 49-year-old owner had to postpone this project in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade: After all, she has now grown in the form of another business location.
At the Furla shop opposite the shop where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and garments from various manufacturers, now everything revolves around women's handbags from the Furla brand, purses from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, it had been converted for several weeks.
"I've long considered, though, whether I should still open a store," Breit says.
The key to the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also inspired by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz metropolitan area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has put Breit in the cradle by her mother.
I am most interested if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women can't answer with any certainty when looking at a beautiful handbag.
Maybe it's because a nice bag appreciates every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called donors.
That property also connects some people with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is xenophobic, harassing journalists, or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis politics, the candidate for the US presidency is vigorously ramping up the election campaign.
And is doing well.
This is also registered in the Pole town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is known to many in the wine village on the Wine Road.
Some in the 1200-resident place is more than -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Kallstadt's Simone Wendel turned down a film about Trump.
And what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the world's most powerful man?
"I think they find this somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way either," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous explosives, which, alongside Trump, includes the ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to terms in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so by saying that he would surely also be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt.
To the King of Hearts, he didn't bring it there.
While there is respect for the family's performance, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is "already a bit of a big maul," Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in its vicinity was "Die Brulljesmacher" - to High German: The donor, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the donors.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a venue for gold graves in the US.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was first property purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to their homes in the long term failed in the Bavarian state to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not include Trump because he was once hacked without permission, the director of the Institute of Pfälzische Geschichte and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared a film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This contrasts with the statements of the descendant, which are sometimes marketed.
The had repeatedly abruptly talked about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as the polar one, that's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandma was born Heinz").
The winemaker in retirement looks more distanced from the American, "he's always so uplifting."
Does he think Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," the 72-year-old says.
"He never took care of Kallstadt." "
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentioned like some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which generally arrived well.
"I can't imagine that from the Donald," the 68-year-old says.
They would be better off if he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had been in charge in the US at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting issues than him," says winemaker Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"My president isn't, of course," she says.
And: "The grapes will be ripe even without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, including in the US awakening interest.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village."
The 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday from the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
There are already 20 "mountaineering villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum population of 2500.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report in the wake of the Liberal leadership loss, but it did not deliver major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, stuck in London as part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise scored an average of 397,000 viewers at the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight increase over ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell short of last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has closed the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average 349,000 viewers at 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with former Serienstar from Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes."
The X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (5: 30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour saturated 720,000.
Hot-Seat average 620,000.
The fall in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will leave Nine confident that Hot Seat will eventually prevail at 5: 30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to suck up the McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly appeared to be whooping The Bachelor.
The woman where Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was tucked into greatest secrecy.
And none of the three girls left will surely not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows the day before from three two, you may have inadvertently given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women left out lyrically about why Wood is the perfect man, naming his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked "If not you, who should receive Woods's last rose?," her answers could become the playwright who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I've thought that throughout the course of the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her together," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the home visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked whom Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's an undecided between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7: 30 p.m.
Originally published as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were plenty of other teams sending requests after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a Gerangel as did the Aussie rugby league conversion at his first punt return on Tuesday in the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a punt return and also enter the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his Rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patterned catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches at a punt restored in the first game quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian followup had hoped for for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble flustered and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the schnitzer with his Origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass at his own in-Goal range led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and popping it up on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with assault rifles.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, confiscating his oil company, Yukos, and curtailing his democratic efforts.
Free voters are calling for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party leader and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria's schools at the start of the FW Autumn Statement in major wallabies if there are not suitably new teachers for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep schools from collapsing," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get dislocations in the Bavarian education system."
The land-based Free voter group is meeting in the Lower Franconian commune until Friday.
Quite different main issues were actually envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free voter meeting, too.
"Of course the issue of asylum will overlay the clay," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"So it doesn't go on, we have to get to the root causes," the Free voter chief said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
That's why Aiwanger also asked more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform federal standards nationwide."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
'There we need to be more effective '.
But the country's politics in large-scale Walloon City should not fall below the table.
A year-long permanent burner remains on the agenda: Education policy.
For the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnasts has launched the pilot experiment "middle level plus," in which an extension of the gymnasial middle level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it then takes another nine years to graduate.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of G9 needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We are calling for freedom of choice for all the gymnasts who want it.
Free travel at the G9 wherever you want.
Fixed Wall Street helps Dax on the jumps
The German stock market has closed with profits after an over-stretched and nervous trading trajectory.
As recently as the afternoon, a more solid start to the U.S. exchanges provided a clear direction that ultimately pushed the Dax up 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax medium-high gained 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
Tech-savvy TecDax rose 1.03 per cent to 1736.69 points.
EuroStoxx 50 as the eurozone's leading index declined 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
Solid gains also buoyed trading places in London and Paris.
In the US, the Dow Jones index last listed about 1 percent in the plus.
Many stock exchanges expect that markets will be on the sidelines until after the interest rate decision in the U.S. and also for the big fall in futures trading this Friday.
The discussion about the burdens from the nuclear exit has meanwhile pushed RWE's shares to a record low and left a deep mark on Eon as well.
According to Spiegel, German energy groups may lack EUR 30 billion in reserves.
The federal government denied the figures cited in the press.
Shares in Germany's two largest energy companies recovered slightly, but eventually lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to one retailer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" acted from the weekend.
So investors were paying too little attention to the German chipbuilder at the moment.
The investment in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the auto market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the previous year, as the ACEA association announced for the launch of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the Daimler and BMW automobiles rose 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.
Volkswagen benefits tumbled 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the circulation rate of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex retirement index rose 0.12 per cent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro's price fell in the afternoon to last at $1.1262.
By midday, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at $1.1305 ($1.1268).
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, lead district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
MR Dhakal said police had deployed tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from the Tharus ethnic group, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been mired in violent clashes since 10.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step toward a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-metre area.
A mix of trade, trade and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of about 4000 square metres in the immediate vicinity of the youth center Alte Post.
Preparations are under way for this.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of commerce, trade and housing.
We are waiting for the relevant offers, it is said on the part of the city.
Which investor is eligible is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is on the ring road / corner of Great Street, a few months ago and demolished the building on it.
Project Hxit: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday house settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor first publicly presented plans for the project.
Many residents are further troubled - they fear the sell-off of their leisure refuges
For months behind closed doors, negotiations had been held, grated, debated and drawn.
Now plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the mid-sized Emder company "System Construction," presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council's City Development Committee.
Originally, this item was on the non-public section of the agenda.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP faction, which accused investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of system-building management went on the offensive: "We don't yet have an answer to all the questions," he said in front of councillors and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now.
The project, which is worth between EUR 10 million and EUR 12 million, has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among sea bay owners who had come to the meeting highlighted the images and new details about the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, sea bay owner and board member at the advocacy group of the assailants, Pro Hhitherto, complains: "This will be a giant clutter that surpasses all other entities."
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that the planned size of the plant would greatly increase traffic: "There must be whole bus loads in order for that to happen," according to Schulz
What exactly happens on the well-stocked area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept in place," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans would still be variable.
Zwillings offspring at gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to seeing young adults at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo says.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been established, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body so far.
At first, the "picture" had reported.
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde islands ahead
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands predicted a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, weather experts in Miami added.
Google launches doubling donations campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (Googl. O) announced a doubling donations campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations intended to help thousands of refugees who have overrode the European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donations call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark rail and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four charitable organizations providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / euros to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by Syria's four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes are living longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show anything," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations, or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations to treat type 2 diabetes have proved efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a degree of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained roughly the same among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% completely dissolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medically-treated group, compared to that, diabetes completely wiped out only one per cent and partly at only about two per cent.
In addition, results in blood pressure checks, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemmoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and rather recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people undergoing obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit to survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. ""
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is an issue that is currently receiving more attention in the field of fiction: A young woman, unloved and unsightly at school times, restores the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder's recent novel "Experience we are not like that."
Beyond the love story, the novel seems to be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not take in all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while Western European countries "response to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions to how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, noting that the US violent response resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has produced unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in intake of hand disinfectants by children in past 4 years
Toxic control centers in the US report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of revenue from hand disinfection in children under the age of 12, the poison control centers report, rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids come to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation probe on social media.
Videos posted on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers allegedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-fuelled oral water to get a tougher drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectant.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand-disinfectant) drugs are the ones that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Especially in infants, few sprayers can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Giftnotcalling Center at the University of Kansas hospital, told broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a rash of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand-disinfectants within reach of children, and if kids get on with it, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprayers of after-strawberry fragrance hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency ward for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and knocked her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very frightening," Ortoria Scott, Nhaiah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant and store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectant that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspected the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the teaching room, "it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banned her from her room.
The police regarded the thwarted plan as a "silencer" and referred disciplinary action to the school authority.
Villingen gunfire: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver has been slightly injured in a search accident on the crossroad between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove along the crossroad towards the industrial area roundabout and realised too late that two advanced vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
In the aftermath, he jumped into the rear of an audit with his truck and chased that vehicle onto a previous Ford Fiesta.
In the vehicles involved in the accident there was material damage of around EUR 10 000, the police say.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer on the road and had to be cordoned off.
Rumble kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths is playing down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place but that he will turn that over again.
Hearts will fight SFA over allegation of Neilson and Warburton being cautious on January new commitments that could destroy the cadre's unit
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooneys elephant in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, leaving the Dons to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not under heightened scrutiny as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Scottish football's lack of title competition borrows Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers' return.
You talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, Deila swears.
Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10-man Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
However, Deila said: "Celtic have had bad times before and we will come back."
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel just like that - but we have to go on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that he was pouring some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing newcomers and insists he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox clerk's unit.
The ex-boss of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, has indicated he could withdraw if his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a crippling ankle for two years and failed to make the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts set on SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3-2, but the defender's Red Card was later lifted - Collum's third Red Card revoked in eight months.

Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unimproved Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted to having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline must end on the pitch.

McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "unwell"
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen desperately struggled against Hamilton Accies to see off a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys elephant in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in pot games or leagues that have not won games of this kind even at times."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than that of UKs of 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: "The government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In those 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunken disturbed the proceedings
As security staff were unable to calm the situation, staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could officials take the troublemakers into custody.
A respiratory alcohol test yielded 0.89 promills at a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promills and initially remained in custody.
Why I'll witness an executive in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in the case of late legal intervention, I will see a man being brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is exonerated by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first made in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day moved closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since more applications are often available as places, a macabre lottery is held to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionally.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him to remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks public relations will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I do not want to go back over all the details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for it.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police pursuit hunt persuaded to come out of Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang off police was unsuccessful when he found himself in the shallow and sumptuous water just metres away from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a house peace incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not getting out, comb and hol me,'" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car in the trenches to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy him out and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit the race immediately.
He cited Racing Victoria's stewards and integrity department, claiming they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching because of a race day treatment, the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt Tupferprobe at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I've had to say nothing about it and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know, it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised main things and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't do that, then I shouldn't be coach anymore.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spin off his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I am doing inside my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
They apparently think I'm a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should surely grab their noses because they failed in trying to grab me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL, and Bernard Sathem, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should that lead me to think that it will become personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blaming people outside trainers for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my licence and breach me and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I've arrived now at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustrations levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to him saying he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unflattering master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
'it's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that, "he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly put mud on the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, which was also the case.
But it also had it that way on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for handling the pack on race day, an investigation into the matter has opened.
It's a joke.
People who put up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here one has gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a clash with a cyclist and subsequent driver's refuge in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police said the car driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia faced police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver evasion and omission of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims to ring fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the teackling of his players as "agenda-setting" by two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed the Storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled note to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern" of rugby league and saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the run-up.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said that while Tackling was only focused on their "contact."
Bellamy added that criticism from two leading coaches at his team made him confidently agree, as it meant they worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps appearing - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques, but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus and that has brought the trend change for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train for, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's already funny how this keeps coming up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember criticising St George as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he was going to take a divorce dreck about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ballgame you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I'm building greater confidence because they're saying these things because they're a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm's game against ROOSTERS scored a higher result than the Broncos' game against Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was arguably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more tries in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's game plans.
If they mention us, it means we're still going to hit on them at one stage.
The Storm team have been free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preliminary final at AAMI Park, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.
Serbier charged with $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and set fire to Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-accused in the marina over the course of the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire quantity and that may have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge on the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the escape threat at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 bail as security combined to reach his release.
"After reading the ostensible statements of the two individuals, it is clear that the $200,000 security requirement is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone won't be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic has been released on bail under the conditions of giving away his Australian and his Serbian passport, complaining to police on a daily basis and sticking to an exit ban of 18: 00-06: 00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Guide pulls apart
A lorry driver has been seriously injured in a car accident involving three lorries on highway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three lorries involved had slowed in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, as police communicated.
The driver's house of the accident causing the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 a.m.
Damage amounted to EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police cared about it and saw the five images, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officials that he had done it as it would lead to "paedophiles on the internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to frighten them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction, - that he was addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that searches were carried out on the computer of him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: 'When the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was at the quotation and at the weeping.
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to including indecent images of children on 14 June last year, breaching the conditions on 25 January this year and not appearing in court at a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, arguing that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael scrapped the ruling until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in the case but was remanded in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers depart on small border crossing with Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
Out on the Austrian side, a spokesman for the federal police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the state districts of Passau and Rottal Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and reservoirs.
There they will be received by federal police and forwarded for registration.
At Munich's main railway station, significantly more refugees arrived again, according to federal police data, compared to the weekly start of Wednesday.
By 8am alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm "Henry" in southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storms in the south-west of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe currents currently warm sea air into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry," which in the past few days has moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, soils of between 60 and 90 kilometres can still be expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Bodenseekreis until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again for longer.
The crowd is doing it: Every two years the highways at the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, there was mainly movement in compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: Some 28.1 percent of new approvals accounted for this segment in August alone, according to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
This is also reflected at the IAA (Publikumstage 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at retailers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the show.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is expecting an entry below its biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from €16 990.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
The Hessen also offer other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp, which for the first time include three cylinder gasoline engines.
Unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a fifth door.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combo, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what about new compact cars next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door version in a conventional and an accentuated sporty GT version.
He comes into the trade early next year, then also as a combo.
Infiniti: Completely new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the design line of the brand.
The base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp available.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbomotor and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer specifications.
Sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën retailer placed their hand on the front part: Here the cooler grill was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time Apples CarPlay integrated.
A series of revisions and new variants such as the refresher Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin Tegel: Five-square-metre cell is man-unworthy
The Federal Constitutional Court gave justice to an ex-detainee of the law enforcement agency Tegel, who had been housed in a too-small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
That's what the Federal Constitutional Court ruled in a decision released Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they have only been locked up for a few days in the too narrow rooms (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
As a result, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel Justice Enforcement Centre between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man, who is now at large again, according to his lawyer, had been moved to a larger cell.
His imprisonment on account of the undignified conditions of imprisonment against the country of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges upheld the ruling of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity being violated.
Chamber Court now decides on amount of compensation
Even though, for legal reasons, the period in question is only a few days' imprisonment for compensation, there is a right to compensation, it has been said.
Otherwise, "caring about the legal protection of the personality" would be to be feared.
The Court of Appeals must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they did not plead damages to a prisoner until April because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, unworthy of human beings is also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday that the Berlin Constitutional Court had granted indecent accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then plaintiff was housed in a similar cell to the one in the Karlovy Vary case for between 15 and 21 hours a day over three months.
Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore constantly being trapped for 23 hours, aggressiveness is rising, even thugs are said to have already arrived because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not filled because of a shortage of young people, 19 are due to drop out in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We're creating this"
Refugee immigration is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
In the face of the unusual challenge, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we do that."
What lies ahead for Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate by the Federal Building Ministry) and 400,000 (estimate by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is being built so far (250,000 homes).
What is dramatic, however, is the lack of housing, especially for affordable rental properties: Between 60,000 and 80,000 social housing per year is excluded from the fixed rental price, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable housing.
Federal Education Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from the current EUR 518 million to EUR 1 billion.
Far too little of this is from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the Federal Government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion a year in funding.
Scientists and federal construction ministers agree that there also needs to be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55 percent of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: From banning refugees from work to recognising work.
While there was previously a ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this one was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, a majority view has prevailed, partly because of the shortage of skilled workers, that refugees should be able to enter the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge.
So far, there is not a sufficient range of general and occupational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the Royal Way to Labour Integration.
Berlin's school administration has found that few winged parents give their children to the kitas, estimated to be ten to 15 percent: "For uprooted parents, it is first very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in Berlin's Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handbags in different languages.
If the large number of refugees increases the need for female educators sharply, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerates study - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance.
Student-willing refugees could be made easier to access college
Because refugees with a residence allowance or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Services Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive a Bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to bafogen.
Tolerated refugees have so far had to live in Germany for four years in order to be Bafög-eligible, from 1 January 2016 this span is shortened to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-churches law into a new state-to-religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that deals professionally with the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear points of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it some means of control.
This includes a willingness to act heartily against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be traced to Germany.
Those who wanted to Australia such conflicts in Germany "immediately violated their right to stay here, in Germany," he told Bavarian radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more an issue for the whole of society in the future than it is today.
In this way, majority society will also have to change, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany, though - as a result of European decisions - has had an anti-discrimination body and a non-equality law for a decade.
Yet it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What immigrant organisations and non-immigrant German interest groups have long called for, and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany would be able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says physician President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man- power and capacity is concerned, we're creating that," he told Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money would have to go into the system for this.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery requires all arrivals to hand out health cards equally when registering.
Services provided could later be accounted for with the federal states.
And, in the long term, it is highly questionable that so many people should be singled out for the limited range of services provided by the Asylum Protection Act.
Otherwise, doctors are mainly making the language barriers create.
So far, as Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are being told worse about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be borne, she claims.
However, it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are far more untreated disabilities, and young people are talking about HIV education.
However, some of the other forms of illness would make German doctors aware of their training, Montgomery said.
"Parasitic or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And, as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, perhaps even mitigation is in sight by the refugees.
Syrians would have a sophisticated education system, and many refugees would even be doctors.
In order to practise, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps take further examinations.
At least half of refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Bundespsychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU München shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatised in Germany.
Those suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with breathing, dizziness, heart rains and death fears, among others.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in social offices, treatment usually takes several months.
Moreover, in the social departments, workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would often decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites to dread
With the new staging "passion" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group into the bane of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you into the manege on the brick-and-mortar lawn to dream.
"Our passion is the circus." "
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chefin.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current Manegenstzenerung.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift to inspire the family lies in the blood.
"It's important to us to get people away from their everyday stroke and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old junior chefin stresses.
"Manegencocktail with a world city flair," director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus's program impresses with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to take on the Cuban duo loosely.
Ease and agility - with these words, they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is said to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Besides numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinate with their fingertips and joyfulness.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
For He Yuan no problem.
Snake men fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Shortcomings in the attitude of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also commented: "If our animals are not good, we are not good either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stabbing unit.
The "four-legged artist," as they are affectionately called, is as far as possible read from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to get into the manege either.
The top priority, then, is to provide good care for the animals.
Especially on her zebroid jumbo, a mixture of a shetland ponyhengst and a zebra stud, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a convent for eight years and nothing has happened.
"Yet then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," Brigitte tells Probst.
Although the zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there will probably be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether it's five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and are wholeheartedly at it."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from September 17th to 20th every day at 17 and 20 o'clock.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11am and 4pm.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 5pm the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers false speech in parliament
MR Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unfazed, but the video of the case quickly spread across social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations from opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with bushfire.
Last month, they had booked him out and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven oppositions politicians received text messages on their phones warning them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns affected MPs that immunity in parliament will end, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts at the company's services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected job cuts result in a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who is to lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of stores that help companies transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50bn in annual sales and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses," according to a statement from the company.
It split a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electric equipment and whose Palo Alto Garage man was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the shift away from traditional PCs toward mobile devices.
The measure by HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and, provided his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strongly last season after a separate ankle injury and then found himself back to his old swing during the pre-season.
"That kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is no bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier injuries Ltd recorded 23 different illnesses from Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the past five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight games since 2007 / 08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to record the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue throughout last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilises, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger faces a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little snap to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to move forward through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the most intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after launching the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with 3.2 measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by distant hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"That drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never mattered at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The absence of similar depictions in shows is evident, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign Against a wretched Life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the inevitability of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-affirming and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can't really buy happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work but by his personality, which shone through interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent embrace, moments of football watching in cosy armchairs and Ross's yearning for Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As one staff member of the phone seething it explained to me:... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and at risk of self-harm really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often don't feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I am right about this" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more long-term mitigation mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
However much my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the setting completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk with you.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria hits out at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG advance to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player, putting the French champion on track, but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a head balltor in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion as they not only aim for qualification for the K.O.-rounds, but an improvement on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a clumsy play by Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal; he was replaced later in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League, so it's a good start to winning 2-0, causing problems for our opponents and looking back relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
'that's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals. ""
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2-2 draw on their own at the weekend against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing-back was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Verrattis's pass behind Malmö's defence before slipping past Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed PSG would score a big win, that was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went wide on Kevin Trapps's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves up at times, with some mispasses and poor clearances, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patted in on no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and then gave up after Cavani deployed him after the restart.
Still, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post....
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, who scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell.
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi spotted a goal at the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't have the same level.
Qualifying games "are not enough."
Hats off in front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through share sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by collapsing commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise in Glencores share price in trading early Wednesday morning to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term impeded growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people arrive in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The poultry are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest assailant is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and echoes President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two state leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving on to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberespionage of China and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Rented out 440-horsepower sports car and drove to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and ran a Ford Mustang.
On the rain-soaked highway, then came the evil awakening.
With a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream by renting out and driving a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was then off and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, fell asleep on wet carriageway and drove into the lead plane.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The material damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern were obviously close to committing a few years ago to Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Cup winners, four-time Champions League winners, two-time club world champion, two-time European champion, one-time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now betrays that he was already on the verge of leaving Barcelona before the 2008 EM.
"One told me that Barça wanted to sell me." "
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing," he tells.
And that's what FC Bayern also registered.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
'Rummenigge wanted me to have it.'
Remember: Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
The change didn't happen, though.
And the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça have put Guardiola under contract and I've played a great EM."
'PEP told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the crew without me.'
'so he got me that.'
Who knows how Bavaria's playing time would have gone with Xavi in 2008 / 2009.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, switching off the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrating royal-class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she won't be needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in reference to a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it at the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted in shock, with offensive disbelief and shouted "Hoo! WoW.
Damon and Brown joined producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would urge people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a Nutte, beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon countered that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the movement scored Black Lives Matter nationwide, pushing lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the launch of nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who will be invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior 'crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the grand prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just kicked off its 7th season, had never seen a competition participant complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to advance to the final.
The final task included climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the job within the period, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished that challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought win, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or gone to life," Isaac told E! About his bunch of money.
As quite suddenly.. as I can not even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
Senior producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, despite being the first to finish the course at all, won't receive any prize money.
Under the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any groom about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He received crowds of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers grind past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are on last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then scored once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine matches.
"I want to finish strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw in the bullpen every game and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first run since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He did the sleep well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (headtraining), looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double at the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a Bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed forward Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of designated Rookie drummer Miguel Sano, who kicked off a two-run homer to right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was that in the Major League-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe beat a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer managed an RBI double against Tigers' Closer Bruce Rondon and scored the stand from 5-4.
The right-hander, however, stripped Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmoving Phil Hughes to kick-start the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been dropped from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I got loose and felt that I'd create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought into play Victor Martinez, who managed a single "up the middle" at the game's first run.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single at the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers scored in the second, reaching a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't score particularly well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes scored three runs on six hits and a Walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez departed because of injury to throw shoulders.
He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injury list since mid-August because of a shoulder fracture, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday's start.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is dropped from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris tied 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a breakdown in right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to shelter in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night to Wednesday.
The people in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She reckoned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hessen state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They are then to be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government office responsible for the initial shooting, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German involvement in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe the firm reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European states of "collective disregard."
Four years ago, one would have been glad that the Kelch passed away from military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict ends crackly on our doorstep," he said on German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
On Tuesday evening, the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austrian broadcaster ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany, too, did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks on this between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
Concrete figures did not name it and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis.
The EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).
Given Germany's strong refugee sanctuary, the federal government wants to provide more support to countries in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of deliberations with the prime ministers at the chancellor's office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would be able to do so.
But if you don't have a lead perspective, you can't stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now needs to cope with a "huge effort of strength."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU in a different way from Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent smugglers from seeking evasive routes over Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had averaged the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe 'Cassini' finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Beneath Saturn's ice tank Enceladus swings a global ocean.
That includes researchers from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon sank slightly on its orbit around the ring planets.
Although this tug-of-war movement is small, it is still too large for a consistently fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) dated Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes on Saturn's southern pole, spinning water vapour and ice particles, feeding Saturn's so-called E-Ring.
At least at the South Pole, there had to be an underground sea, astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not settled.
Rama lacks 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to miss out on offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation had revealed an adductive injury to the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier in the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis "is expected to mean four weeks of forced interruption."
'that's hitting us hard, Rama's a here.'
"Of course we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper, looking at the possible commitment of a unidentified professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croate currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its skills."
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie may return to team training next week after his brain shake.
The Austrian national player is scheduled to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had hurt himself in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0: 3) in a fierce clash at the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious blessings.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to be discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless: They contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Before all of them, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and their precursor beta-carbohydrate.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smells pleasant.
The shellfish colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It soothes the slightly bitter taste of some leaf alates such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
UPS, the US parcel service, is once again providing up to 95000 rescuers for its Christmas business in the US.
The company had already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers in particular are being sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95000 for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking early precautions for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First Föhnstorm, then striking cold front
Next night erupts in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night to Thursday, the Föhn blows in part with storm strength through the Föhntäler.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing powerful rainfall, wind floors and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a vigorous southwest flow.
On the north side of the Alps during the night to the Wednesday of the Föhn breaks through the valleys.
As a result, the Föhn blows in the valleys of Föhntälern until Thursday morning with floors ranging from 60 to 100 km / h, divided and especially in the Urnerland partly also with over 100 km / h.
The Föhn can penetrate to the adjacent Mittelland in some places, and on the mountains it is even possible to reach orchids of more than 120 km / h.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy Föhn is causing summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture is beginning to dump on the Alpine foothills.
Here, rain sets in, which continues until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps must be expected in the next 48 hours with partly more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn is running out of air, as a result of which a cold front with strong, partly sweeping rain is rolling from west to east across Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly until stormy, and temperatures drop significantly.
The following days will be autumn in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be more sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Barely 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognised as a "German theologian of Reformation."
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome right next to the Coliseum.
The naming had been requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, parish priest of the Evangelical-Lutheran congregation in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of popes for centuries as a minority could often only live in hiding their faith.
With the square, it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk who spent several months in Rome at the turn of 1510 / 11.
At the time, he perceived the city as a miserable scapegoat.
His negative impressions may have emboldened him, according to historians, in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then begun the division of the Ablasshandel church with his theses against the Ablasshandel.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) village crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colours and fanciful shapes has preserved the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary, adapting to each subject can have quite a gloomy effect.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books."
There have been cycles devoted to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fatherhood.
He spontaneously fascinated several partners: The Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as the Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible sites on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible places chosen by Otmar Alt and thus translated them into current contexts.
These lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation by Martin Luther and each one by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the situation in question.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old equally twice allows a deep glimpse into his soul, his emotions.
That's a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler order.
"There the upbringing happened with the pipe stock," Otmar Alt recalls.
'i tried to work that up to maybe get me back with the Lord Father as well '.
His second concern is to restore the importance of art in a fast-paced time: "The perception of image worlds is now characterised by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being squeezed out there.
Artists have a different desire and Wonne to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
'in this respect, I'm a dinosaur '.
Otmar Alt wants viewers to "fall into the pictures," make them impact on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have: "The image seeks its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation that he "has always been a lover of Otmar Alts art:" I like how he understands life with his pictures. "
Old did not care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, including mysterious ones.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that opens on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX train approaching
Plans made, space found, companies instructed, Erdhügel modeled for a circular course: One year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX Railway was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused oblivion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways.
So hill pushed off, new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
In October, the first local councillor, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, was able to inform the children's and young people's committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible happening," she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a "further pause for remembrance."
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga set a clear mark over the weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and provides the policy with its help in dealing with the problems that lie ahead.
'i think this is our country's biggest challenge since reunification '.
'There, in principle, nobody can say, this is not about me, I have nothing to do with it.'
"This must interest every individual to get to grips with this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
"I am in the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"There's certainly going to be a central role in that," he announced.
Football can and will help.
Politics must, however, set the decisive course.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1-0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach explained on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some federal ligists also support this program.
As early as this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send out a clear signal when they will wear the label "We help - # greateswelcome" on the left tricotella instead of the usual sponsorship logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusens sports chief Rudi Blizzard told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday), describing the project as "self-evident."
'the refugee drama is affecting everyone, nobody's allowed to look out.'
"We football federal ligists can, no, we have to use our tightness, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale for the EM qualifying match against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football."
That all 36 licencing clubs had started their own projects in their locations is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1-0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
"That's of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, the Association will provide EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have also already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP chief executive loses eye in accident
The chief executive of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye by a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the US, he had fallen on a water glass after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost burned, was powerless, then got dragged out onto the street - that's what he told us so last week," the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner is quoted as saying.
McDermott, though, could do his job.
"In early October, we meet before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully operational."
McDermott announced in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
'i'm fully there for SAP, full in my work.'
"Of course I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told the "SZ."
McDermott usually travels between Germany and the US, but since the summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
Telling him it was important to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "To anyone, something like this can happen."
'it's important to stand up again when you've fallen asleep '.
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of contention...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo, explaining that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He therefore does not come into question as a reserve driver for the two tribe drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the weekend, as he did a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BvB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League finally smashed.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the Football Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. / Sky).
"We can't resort to him unfortunately," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
As to whether Reus will be back at the Bundesliga's top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
Given the high burden on his professionals, Tuchel will not just change his pedigree at the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller occupies the place of master keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future left Tuchel open.
He is highly likely to contest the second match as well.
The forceful statement by fellow player Reus that the final move for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl to be understandable: "Marco is not so wrong with that."
"I think we have a good chance of tapping into the title." "
Robot cars: Government wants lead for Germany
Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car, according to the Federal Government.
The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which envisages, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the Automesse IAA of a "new mobility age."
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who are also meeting with industry representatives at the IAA.
Among other things, the transport ministry's strategy paper emphasizes the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio.
A test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
So that the driver "does not face additional liability risks," the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permitted speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to see an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Still, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not expected until well after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at Germany's site for 2025 at around EUR 8.4 billion.
"Digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
Yet Germans still view self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe autonomous-driving cars will prevail in the coming decade, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous-driving cars by 2025, up 33 percent in the U.S.
Anyway, motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven per cent would agree to hand over control throughout the ride on all roads.
On the motorway, that in fluid traffic could still imagine 15 per cent, in congestion 45 per cent.
Well every fourth would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
According to the current state of play in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October, the Düsseldorf player only wants to turn up in one place.
The final decision is due to be taken on 22 September at the latest.
"That's a huge loss for our team." "
'the guys got to know it in the morning '.
"We are strong enough, though, even without getting Timo the title," Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf said during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that point, Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are now no longer such a clear favourite," explained single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
However, the Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
'at the time, Timo also went missing and we became European champions'.
"We should be guided by this," the world ranking fifth declared.
English soccer national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury at the right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit at a teackling by Héctor Moreno and exchanged after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger was on a rail break.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It's a mix of very large fashion show and a wax-figure gruselcabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: Storefront puppets that look terribly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who, with Madonna's stage outfits among others, became the great star of the fashion scene - and by putting men in skirts.
'i can't say anymore today that I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair '.
"Previously it was baked, meanwhile it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the pavement on the catwalk), which is to be seen from 18 September in the Art Hall of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially opposed attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he would have been against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is a superbly choreographed work of art, for which much effort has been made: For example, a stylist was dedicated to frying the dolls.
14 tonnes of material carved the makers into Munich, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special delicacy: A leather trousers outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultiers old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, timid fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he attracted his teddy bra and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He steel fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told reporters in Munich.
Later, though, I bought them of course.
He was unable to pay the models for his first own fashion show.
They got nothing but were allowed to keep the clamoring.
Jewellery instead of Gardine - Plauener tip as fashion niche
Earlier, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about to make metres.
Embroidered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a bigger role, then was squeezed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: Lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At all, the so-called vintage fashion, which resembles past stylespoons, is creating an increasing job potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and embroidery association.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken away.
Private shops and wholesale stores almost no longer exist.
Our products do not reach customers in this way.
Nowadays, bulk goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
Exports are also weakening, currently to Russia and the US.
So there are plenty of reasons for new paths.
The association also tries to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been running a quality label that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible products."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplomat Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausßenstelle of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroideries and tips.
In order to counteract competition from the Asian region, we need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the designers "freshest ideas and the businesses that need to think economically, above all," Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
In some places, the machine sticks to small kitchens.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeisterin Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before that I could not start with traditional Plauener Spitze."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the subject of Plauener's tip - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the US, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surrounding areas and who would like a reminder piece.
This makes me see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not be stirred, but Disney still dares to make a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins."
According to "Entertainment Weekly," though, this is not about refilming, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical little girl 20 years after the first film.
It's about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family at times of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing firm: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
XI urges to open economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to encourage growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday of a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve business start-up strategies," he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deepening comprehensive reform.
Encouraging new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting state-owned enterprises (SOE) to take private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is being drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is significant as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a rule-of-law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers transferred to businesses and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of a bid to open up government-controlled sectors, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
In addition, it makes it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimizing requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their work, and to employ professional judges and prosecutors, was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants mercury limit to double in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby giving consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve gifts.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, sharply criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and toddlers," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons."
Large-scale predators, however, are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that around 50% of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the limits still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5% would be unsold.
In exchange for this easing, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to tighten the limit on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller cemeteries, such as carp, are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The lowering of small-scale fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is greatly enriched through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of unborn ones."
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage that a "health hazard of the general population" cannot be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal incineration.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total emitted in Germany, according to written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and universally exceeded," the "Mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
