28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco has been found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone wanting to harm him, "Finally it went uphill with him again."
The corpse found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco-based court medical department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and that investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had attained his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated at his death."
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Franks's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things were finally going uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way to connect with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner, "Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
"On everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unhinged diamond that lit up brightly every day," he said.
Anyone with information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's phone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I always get stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
That made the Hollywood star unequivocally clear in an interview now.
'i'll always be stuck in drawers or get glued up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality of it.'
'i myself don't have a desire to always be perfect and succeed.'
"Honestly, these things are more snuff to me." "
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about being considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
In fact, the actress likes to spend her time at home, in front of television with a loose dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glut, she put the question of the child's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
Chio: "Golden Sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday night, they hunted home to feed trunks in the fast gallop.
A kilometre at that pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He was allowed to run with his family over the facility of the ALRV, on a horse he hadn't even swung for photo purposes.
Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite compelling.
German sports aid provided the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards from the likeable athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already adorned him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been promoting offspring.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Master ssieger was added to the "Hall of Fame of German sport" on Saturday.
The awards include the Leichtathleten Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the feeder Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Whard.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
According to the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policies by comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates are divided on fiscal and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
Underlying the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, by contrast, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will cut regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, by contrast, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
In what needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost wordlessly.
The democratic candidate even announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic Democratic policies and are strongly opposed, for example, by the state-critical Teaparty wing of Republicans.
So there may still be bipartisan discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and lift coal production in the US again.
Oil production is also to be possible in areas that have been protected so far, and he intends to terminate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Clinton, by contrast, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy through her investment program, calling for "a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
'it's probably going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it.'
But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, the US does not want to isolate from international trade - it simply wants to protect American jobs better.
They should then also be paid better, for example, calls for Clinton.
The current $7.25 minimum wage is a starvation wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: Once, he says, the minimum wage must go up, then he says it must not be changed.
But the big discussion over the coming months is more likely to revolve around the tax policies of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics cautioned him that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to require the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say more taxes are also not the solution.
Escape: "Every winged woman has experiences of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fleeing on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who is at most one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table plate.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is executive director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are winged.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs set up the facility along with Pro Familia and Munich Women's Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men there are none - even not as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It's not an exaggeration to say: Every woman who arrives here has had experience of sexual violence on her flight," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they face torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls," she tells me.
Among women, other reasons for the escape outweigh: "Many steal secretly from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
It continues to do so.
On the run, that continues.
"That smugglers, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," Bahr says.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that the end, once they arrive in Germany, is wrong, Bahr tells.
Again, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and at worst abused.
That results in about 90 per cent of women staying in accommodation in the Munich north being traumatised, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not voluntarily emerge." "
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too great." "
Because they often don't know how to help, there needs to be more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven county governments are responsible for housing refugees.
Some answer No to the question of whether they knew of a similar project to the one in Munich within their sphere of competence.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in swings, women fired alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken, in some dormitories there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important for men and women to be housed separately."
"Lack of privacy, or being housed together by men and women, may result in - ongoing - violence against women."
The washrooms in particular should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study states.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be read out at the Andrang, which exists on the house in Munich.
"Since talking around that it's got us, we've got a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily make up a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Calls for new work strike
Assistant doctors' deputy doctors have called on their union to approve new labor action in their disputes over a new contract.
The junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more workplace action from early September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to respond to concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, the chairwoman of JDC Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently calm" about problems, leading to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and has requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today made a formal request for a special BMA Council meeting to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labor action that begins in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors strike six times this year, the first overall outages in the history of the NHS.
The head of BMA assistant doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be approved.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands up and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile was narrow, and he radiated little warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - all five times, according to a report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.
But a sustained cool from Putin showed that Russia's leader had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: The downing of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was wuttering.
Putin split out, accusing Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.
The offence was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the vetrough will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also rocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by nearly 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it views its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
Add to this the persistent resentment over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations, and Putin - eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glorious seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to portray what one analyst once described to me as an "alliance of outsiders": Two countries that feel violated by the West and badly treated, and now allied.
Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down Russia's combat jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She backed international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has chosen to focus on more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands now."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has previously said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" The board chief said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and launched those brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs rather than our own, I think you'll see a lot of change.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches out to predilection his 3,000th win at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won before that on Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the jug as he picks up victory at predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-maiden winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who scored more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbywinner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern era and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He's a fantastic ambassador for race, his enthusiasm and charisma have thrilled fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he'd already fetched 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the epitome of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous 1996 "Glorrich Sieben" at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his two-flyers and return to his best form.
And he's far from finished - Dettori has previously said he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50,000th year.
Russia's Putin fires Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transport affairs.
In a Kremlin statement, it states that, without giving reasons, Putin had "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of Russia's presidential administration."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of the governing body.
Speaking about his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your confidence."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as Head of State with regard to draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
That move has made Moscow secretive.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants, working as he does for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the country's most powerful men.
At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the general election.
Is there, then, the consequence of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official assertion - that a man once hailed as a potential president wants to run Russia's environmental policy at once - was met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to entrust me this very complicated post - it could almost be said - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
He was previously deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people to whom he trusted most.
It was once thought that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was last month involved in a physical dispute on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his termination.
There were artistic differences and differences of opinion on the set.
I regret the incident, "he said in a notice.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been with him since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have spent the last 12 years plugging my whole heart blood," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans who can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery surrounding fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be Sandaale, mirrored by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, released a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of "cover blowers" approaching completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 milling parts.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge bridge bridge is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for paving.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge endeavors are in their place and the final section of the decks gets a refuel for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high and low-rise construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower deck under construction, we then had to close the gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by drawing the northern Zubringerbrücke 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
Delicate, as the tolerances that the team was working towards were tiny - on each side they amounted to just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men 'lucky still to be alive'
Three men are 'lucky still to be alive' after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13: 20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving out of their own power.
"We saw how the boat turned around near her and presented us with the worst," the head of Moelfre's rescue station Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we left for water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging on a Boje without a rescue guard.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency plug-in, but it got rid of the person who was steering the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone woke up today about these men.
Seriously injured - Man sticks to his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife.
As police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the flat to pick up his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcohol-fuelled perpetrator cut apart his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When this one came into the flat, he stumbled upon them twice.
The 44-year-old was shot at the hand and injured at the body.
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her life companion, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn't get him to leave the apartment, though.
That's why she walked out of the house with her life companion.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women grabbed the flat again, the 50-year-old shoved his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of action for housing" at the next Council meeting.
But contention is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap housing?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens that if you want to build on urban land, you have to designate 20 percent of all housing as social housing in the future."
However, the favorable housing can also be built in the stock.
The big point of contention in the town hall, however, is, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such land, but as much as 20 per cent of homes as possible as social housing." "
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and will still have to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann argues, the situation in the housing market is worsening.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff are needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the professionals.
However, the programme is not yet complete: The approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how does one compare the loss of another around 1300 affordable homes, the funding of which will be phased out in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, it will be 500 homes.
To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be bought from the city.
In addition, consideration would have to be given to bringing homes back into price fixing.
That's possible in the western city.
In one fell swoop, the problem could be solved.
Because in the West Town, deadlines are running out at the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be fetched back there in the price cap for cheap housing.
Just: That's what the owners, the housing societies don't want.
After all, if the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, the aim of the so-called confluence is removed.
There should no longer be a concentration of socially vulnerable people in just a few neighbourhoods.
The Greens reckon there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group leader Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."
This has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that's worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their spare time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
Time on screen was initially confined to TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell before the game's release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are tracked down with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."
A generation who played the game when she was even younger joined the Wahn and jumped in for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in moves that the "average" person rests on every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people trailing for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to boost performance.
Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take themselves 30 minutes," "get off the sofa" and "be active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Yet the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who do sports regularly reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.
But the wonder thing about Pokémon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that gives them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are Mürrian spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What should be?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier in the day, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the Damental
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Stunning on the ground.
On a whole line brilliant.
And now, at last, Olympic.
The 19-year-old American gymnast clambered into Thursday's multi-fight title and widened the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlight of the Olympics.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
American woman Simone Biles turns on the sultry beam during the women's single multi-combat event in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, while consolidating her reputation for being the best of her generation, or even at all.
She broke down in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best turner I've ever seen."
It awaited her a final exam in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of outsized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's individual multi-fight inals in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while at the farewell ceremony of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi as the exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted, during her long road to the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of her ground exercises - which include her typical tumbling pass - are matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-campaign contest since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led slightly through two twists, the picture blew.
Pig beams and ground urns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lauded.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the sultry beam - and put one more on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman embraced her gently as she awaited her final glance - a mere formality - and tears poured on Biles's gleefully red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she struggled for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, dubbed "grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground exercise, she threw cushions at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that at times seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case at music hearing in car shot
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while staying in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an entry, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report read.
Police shared that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not carry the handbags or the $2,900 found in possession of one of the adult victims.
Police spokesman Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was battered because of her injuries and later passed away.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died on the ground.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the serial killer's work.
Investigators found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It gets better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the fewest of his age, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I don't manage that.
I don't manage that.
I didn't get into that.
What's not true at all -- of course you got into it, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never recognise them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.
'My first response to that was' I didn't know that people were still doing that, '' explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until his third year of life and he still can't speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can run with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows off the sign language Edmund devised for "Please sing me a little before."
"We bring him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says, Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: Genetic as with Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked about the prognosis for a long time because I don't expect her to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's going to get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding give rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help with affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, told reporters that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were multiplying.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service revealed that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area.
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabamas on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow-downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas across the treacherous rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams were still pouring people out of floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts of southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she'd never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency crews had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were staying until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rain and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil had been significantly full-blown by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching outages in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a congregation in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, which have now both been flooded.
The head of the community Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were strapped by the flooding.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"Once the water starts going back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the community of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads have been closed due to the flood and sandbags have been provided for residents to take part, who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city government.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countess said it continued to rain along the Gulf Coast.
According to his details, a handful of homes are said to have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, 'smashed by bullets', survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police share that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents admitted that Brown suffered multiple gunshot injuries, including in the lungs, leg, arm and belly, but that he was in hospital with consciousness when he was transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe that.
The boy's condition was deemed critical at a hospital and he had to undergo multiple surgeries.
The boy's family told the broadcaster that he is expected to be recovered.
He should have started first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot dead: Two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the broadcaster reported.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are currently investigating whether they could be among one of the injured men of the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridges for assault rifles, which were traced back to various storm rifles, sewn over the site.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
Hers were found on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved, "police hautpmann Anthony Ginaldi told the station in Philadelphia.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests were made and police are currently reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a queue at the arm as she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gym, and that's for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three Turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this crew, which round off Aly Raisman, who is Jüdin and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, number one among female Turners has been an Afro-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how gym classes across the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four women in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.
But the reality is that Turner is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gym clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel - clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their turners and families).
The majority of these turnclubs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, Turner gets all their training and that's an expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since starting the gym.
We need to give communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more efficient and easily accessible gym.
I founded my turnstile of 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gym in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality tournaments to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this terrific Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls to take an interest in the gym and that's great.
It's so important to take part in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holen of Olympic team gold and thanks, fass motivated her so many young girls with varying backgrounds to begin her way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to introduce the contract forcibly and said the NHS would be in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
First assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and week care to improve care at ungovernable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA Committees of Assistance, said in a notice last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and administer it to treat all doctors fairly."
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate, and sometimes to obscure silence.
That happened to the one promise Jeremy Hunt had made just last month about his door being always open.
'Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant physicians' .'
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work action.
The latest strike in late April saw an uplift of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved in providing cover to doctors on the strike poster chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, general manager of NHS staff, urged assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-struggle measures achieve none of the little but burden already overburdened teams and service providers and only cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, payers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the assistants' department and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional leave, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about complying with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended administering this to more people for an extended period of time.
The germinating drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already being administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NICE's regulator of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NICE's regulator of the NHS has recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form harassment.
When the debris breaks apart, it can cause a blood clotting that closes blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clots, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, made by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces that risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE's draft guidance, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Assessment Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fears of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor combined with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit.
Information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness lets electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on charges of causing a government report on corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a damning government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "over-sensitivity to ethnie and religion."
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption campaigner, said intimidating voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockers outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter just has to give his name and address.
The report suggests putting non-removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to combat electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be deposed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.
Rahman is said to have "conducted his campaign on the basis that it is the reliant duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular alarm at the fraudulent postal vote - which would have put pressure on older members of the Muslim community to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading expats to prove identity
His report said: "As evidence it was appropriate to put pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, particularly communities with a Pakistani or Albanian background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "over-sensitivities regarding ethnie and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political campaigners from editing postal ballot documents to stop "election harvests."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Options consider asking voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once she has cast her vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic letter choice.
Ban that political campaigners process full postal ballot and envelopes of postal ballot.
Give the police the power to set up lockouts around polling stations.
A change of law that facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).
Shooting ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Stepping up training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth on their own.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal evidence has been placed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for office because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty of sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal case - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the ineffective "hawkish controls" of town hall election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Mad for Kates cyclist doppelgänger and other famous doppelgängers of Olympic portals in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been advised this week about French cycling woman Pauline Ferrand-Prevot out of edge and band, who has proved to be an impressive doppelgänger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionkin is far from the only gold-fighting athlete to feature his own famous doppelgänger this summer - at least not if you're allowed to believe social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flipping on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood's famous.
The hunter and wolf: U.S. team member in archery shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's doppelgängerin on the cycling track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archery might be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
Us team member in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks uncanny to the Wolf of Wall Street star emerged.
In fact, the archguard got along with the madness on social media, admitting that he has been told since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except facial comfort," Brady told the Huffington Post.
'he's a good-looking guy, so I'm probably figuring that out as a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt be even more central this year: The heartbreaking similarity between British wide-jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian turspeaker Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is said to have gone through as a doppelgänger for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear up: This user believes that Nathan is the 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another sustained comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly severe eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal-winning swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attuned by fans to equal an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
One Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
Indeed, US soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in turner Gabby Douglas, who has her own gorgeous, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of the fourth-place 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m Freistilschwimmstaffel outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like rent" and during the race like "a pig died."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone had been turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m FreistilSwimming season.
Macdonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS commentator team to lend more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, gone off like rent, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett MacFarlane tweeted, "Hat the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "?????
The idiot didn't captivate that they were still on broadcast. ""
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final 4 x 200m Freistilschwimmstaffel für Frauen folgendemaßen: "This little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many calling him a speech
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: 'WoW, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologise for the comment about a swimming performance being broadcast."
It was an unhappily chosen phrase, we're sorry it's happened.'
CBC ultimately apologized over 90 times to people who responded to the noticed via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a notice.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on broadcast last night and our followern on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer rather than her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unhappily chosen wording; Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment, saying it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad at the CBC Olympics," he said.
'i was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person.'
Of course, no disrespect was intentional and I'm very sorry. ""
Shoppers in Primark outraged at woman trying shameless underwear in middle of shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes amid a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she muttered as she looked at it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She leaned on and tried four pairs of underpants at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried the underwear, "she moved in again and left the business without buying anything."
She said: "People couldn't believe what they were seeing."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the outlet, pulled out her own tights and trousers and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheering like Oskar." "
'everyone startled when she pulled out the underpants again, which obviously didn't please her as she put them back on the shelf '.
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before finally deciding that she liked nothing, pulled up again and walked out.
'They didn't seem to be bothering that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried it.'
MS Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants with them home that had another person and that were not washed up."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
MS Davidson added: "As I got along, staff tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
'i'd hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had grabbed them and pulled them out again and they weren't wash.'
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday 9 August."
All the products in question have been pulled from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world out there is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spider around for your robber.
When you get closer to you from behind, you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you slap it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee to the bar and, as the attacker crumbles in pain, grab the gun from his hands, beat him with the run to the face and move backwards as they put the weapon on him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twisting it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is performing.
But remember that in a robbery, it's safest to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright scrambles for a tour guide his tongue in Europe's most dirty places
A British traveller underwent serious testing of his immune system and stranger flex - by leaking some of Europe's most dirty and eclectic places.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shuttered his turn on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate his immune system's resilience.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought to light some surprising results.
The thought of licking the sink of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his tour of Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria, as well as about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he leaked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating peculiar as well as wonderful things.
From public money at train stations to washpots of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the film, he told reporters: "Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His trial score showed a luminometer count of more than 4000 units.
By comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to leak after its luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish maker of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria count in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst thing I've smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I am not going to leak anything here because it is glaring inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D, to help promote intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Lass call us Ian."
They claim that interest in colorectal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of colorectal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a terrific sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's directorial, added: "Let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had emptied some of the things I instructed him to lick, just like the eclipsed Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've included some of these dirty delicacies on film.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain conjoined lactic acid resins.
Asocial family destroys before deloging social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with £50,000 worth of damage because it had terrorised their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked residents of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed gaping holes, wooden dives were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was sliced to the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is believed she now lives in a private shelter
Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the flat is no longer going to be repaired.
She said: 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I feel that people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be seen as a not-so-beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is it too.
The couple had three sons who had been living in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball sleepers, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shouting, stretching and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.
Old rubbish was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished
It was in the property where drugs were traded in the past that the wooden diels were torn up
Neighbours said they saw them fighting in the street and regularly had to be called to police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily pull out.
The delusion was cheered on by relieved neighbours who said their lives were made hell.
One said, "They were shouting at no one."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep '.
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to get nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, as delocalisation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horribly witnessed for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police, as well as members of the community who have bravely approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give solace to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the house's bedrooms after deloging on the floor
Homemanagement workers will now have to clear up rubbish mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernals and cash totalling £1,700.
Skeldon was given a fine after being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a homeless shelter, it is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private shelter in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.
Police say it will delve into tenants who fail to comply with house rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the delocalisation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house order.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations, as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in panic after a tieffing military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
An Indonesian P-3C Orion Air Force plane set off an incredible fall flight
The Air Force indicated it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment frightened tourists begin to panic after a tiefforting jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost within striking distance of the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise of the nozzles without first seeing what was coming through the clouds on them.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew twice really deep over and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby area fires, however the Air Force insisted that security was not at risk at any time.
Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portuguese Air Force officials said today that due to conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - the pilot had to fly so deep, limiting his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca facing concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting on Sunday for the first step to their first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans compete in the duel around Spain's Supercup outside against FC Sevilla, the rematch rising three days later at Camp Nou.
The Doublewinner must miss out on Neymar in the power race with the lower-ranked Cupfinalist and reigning Europa League champion among others, who competes with Brazil for the Olympic soccer tournament.
Also missing is goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
The German suffered a bleeding in the knee during the training session, which clears up Barca's enquiry, at least for the time being, in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far renounced a clear decision in this respect, leaving Bravo in the league but Ter Stegen ahead in most of the other candidates.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there is doubt at the Spanish champion about the team's fitness status, which was humiliated in a Test match by Liverpool on Saturday with 0: 4 remaining.
Lionel Messi and Co. also didn't really know how to convince at 3: 2 in the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, in turn, have to digest the 2: 3 defeat after extending in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and are aiming for second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
In doing so, the world ranking-first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and turned out the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would fetch the single title in the character of the Five Rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic trek was former SVS NÖ legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone at the plate, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches at all.
They had retired to the grandstand and left their shooters alone in the fair competition.
'the matches up to here I've played for my country.'
"In the final I play for myself," Zhang had said folly.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace at the plate and left Zhang with only a total of 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected matchless match did not develop.
But, nonetheless, there was enough breathtaking ball change to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4: 1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to settle "ultimately" with sheet metal.
By the way, Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had become in similarly high table tennis old Olympic fourth.
Donald Trump admits' huge problems' in campaign
The leadership of US Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-assured multimillionaire expressed such concerns, as correspondents reported.
Having thrown 16 rivals inside his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump said in front of evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blaming false reports on his candidacy, he again picked up his well-known media chest.
Republican strongholds wacky
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a poll by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, though not by the distance that is customary for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered.
In a CNBC interview, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just as I have done so far."
And chime afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will take a very nice, long holiday."
He doesn't do anything other than "tell the truth."
If it wasn't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that would be fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is alleged to have threatened Trump to cut money in support of his campaign should he not be able to present better poll numbers.
Instead of that, the Republican nominees for Congress want to be given a stronger hand.
Olympia: Three-day fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athlete threatens Ungemach after second doping affair at Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Kenya sent a trainer home after a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The International IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to launch its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, handed the sample and signed off," explained Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list for training checks.
Ferguson Rotich had become Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 metres in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is alleged to have informed athletes of his country's pending doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he is alleged to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are targeted.
Before the Summer Games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympia's start.
As a result, WADA took Kenya off the list of countries whose doping fight is compliant with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletics won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of TV reports by ARD, accusations have repeatedly been made that drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is to be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed it in Russian athletics.
It has been proven that this sport has been widely and systematically dopt.
Russia's athletics were subsequently barred from the summer games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: The "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classical and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he warms.
We always say that it is very Latin American-shaped.
There are plenty of Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It's a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with Wehmut, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First because she's musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mariah's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She very much resembles my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honour for us to work with her.
She is an enormously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that's very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York and the New York residents didn't want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It was suspected she was killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London climbed into a plane heading towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as Supreme Court nominee in case of victory
Harry Reid, leader of Senate Democrats, is convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the late judge's successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a phone conference that he expects Garland to be selected by Clinton "with some degree of certainty."
A Reid spokeswoman later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
RAID said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination were lackeys and aides to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidential race.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his neck magazine was different from Oldschool playboys, as "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing that for women.
Apparently, he thinks it's the calendar doing too.
"We need to return to portraying timeless and classic nudity, with both women and men feeling comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the release of the calendars.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community reckons mass exodus
"Whoever doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed caffeine," says the Organization of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand," Association Chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Because of the crackdown on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I am counting on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," says the association's chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with prosecutions months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey were on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees at home," Toprak said.
The association chief lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish towns as well as in alevitic towns.
In doing so, Erdogan wanted to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been wiped out or displaced in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The association chief demanded that the federal government position itself "as sharply as Austria does against Erdogan and his supporters."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, mainly Kurds and opposition figures.
The fire marker as a Gülen follower destroys teachers and other academics "professional existence.
"Whoever doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed caffeine, by the way, including the Kemalists and seculars," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related foundation Dialogue and Education, told the "World."
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany even before the coup.
By the deadline of 30 June, this had been 11.386 people and thus just under 29 percent of all those recognised as eligible (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of prospects.
In accordance with the Basic Law, individual persecuted persons are exclusively political, in other words from the state side.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, they understood.
In 2021, the state election will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided earlier this year.
For it is not possible to be foolhardy than it has been up to now: Summer holidays, heat and a country-day election campaign - that is all there is to say.
Locals to be persuaded by election campaigners are on holiday
Most holidaymakers in the country, travelling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, aid workers hanging up posters, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers and, at the end of the day, counting out votes are only laborious.
By September 4, 2016, the Election and Last Holiday Day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must once again campaign narrowly past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What's exciting is how heavily newcomer AfD is cut off and what's left of coalition power at the end.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, looking off his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributing roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary worldly predecessor, Harald Ringstorff, did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for blooming the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We create this," has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is likely to cost him the fine job.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen what it is like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the north-east.
But the target audience did not agree, more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlins and Saxony were there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, complained recently in the NDR.
But it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual campaign stops in marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloons.
That, Kokert argues, only plays a "subordinate role."
The Union, too, has noticed that its rural base is crumbling away, that it has to make a great effort to find another wire to the people.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: Barely present in the woes of the country.
The advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow activists, however, is also self-exposing: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still won clearly with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into landfall.
They make a modern virtue out of holiday distress and largely relocate their campaign to the internet.
"Online election campaign," it calls the country's chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election campaigners are embarking on lane searches for native voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curved by a houseboat through the mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment."
B27 refurbishment: Restaurants suffer from lock-up
There is nothing to eat at the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and ends at around 8 p.m., there is all the praise.
"Those have made everything pretty zacky," Elvira told Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site was scheduled to be moved south at half-time at the beginning of the week, until the end of October.
We are also praised for the courtesy of those responsible for the construction work, for example, when it comes to the establishment of container entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted, so that the connection to Rottenburg can be restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
From Ofterdingen, citizens can now ride the B27 on both sides again.
Evasive traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints," says deputy chief executive Florian King, who is responsible for traffic management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many walkways searched and trusted their Navi rather than signposts.
That led to some lorries being franchised in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not met, the congregation increased its demand for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant transgressions," says King, who once told local media about the situation.
Two to three per minute has already been blown.
The fastest was travelling at 77 hours in the pace-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, though, it has become more quiet.
For the business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the street is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look in the cards.
But that the B 27 refurbishment has caused them to fall in sales leaves everyone wondering to look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer," in other words for other companies, have little to do with remediation.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "slight decline" in car dealership Maier, but also admits that, of course, "the running atmosphere is lacking."
The most crowded are the locales along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
That is already threatening to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had "hit it hard."
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
It cites revenue losses as "well over 50 per cent."
The road refurbishment has "knocked back" its operation by two years.
He had to lay off half of his staff.
If I had a firm with 4000 employees and half would have been laid off, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation by saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages caused by the refurbishment.
Göhner knows from other rural districts where such a thing has been handled more generously.
For all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family farm has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regular passengers now have less frequent reservations because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't get down, it's beautiful elsewhere, too.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the renovation work has finished.
Despite the BSE and avian flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction is already brutal.
Laws are constantly being screened in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now proposing a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Versöhner.
All of his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, the federal interior minister says when presenting his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, wider issues would be discussed initially within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Home Secretary, however, he wanted results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière took some time off after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, proclaimed, rushed: That a new security agency should take care of cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies comes as no surprise either.
In part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to punish sympathy advertisements for terrorist groups and crack down on jihadists with dual citizenship of the German passport.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
It nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not call for anything that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas de Maizière also presents.
They have it in part: He plans fast-track procedures for deportation and more opportunities to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are purposefully brought into the country are to have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In denouncing rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse off than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also have an unelaborated effect and leave questions unanswered.
And on a number of points - the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the Ansbach and Würzburg attacks were refugees.
Moreover, many people worried about security, given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply employed people could not be excluded even in campaign times.
Internal security has been hugely focused.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, election campaigns are on.
The Union and the SPD are therefore becoming increasingly involved in the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a high level between the two parties.
First, a garish dispute over the equipment of federal police, then over a security-policy ideas collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which department chiefs also call for a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't think anything of a departure from the double pass.
We have been freezing the debate in Germany.
It does not make sense to reopen it.
And with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to emerge.
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also trying to take advantage of the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel once cautiously signals a willingness to talk, saying: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen still glimpses through.
Despite diesel scandals, extradition numbers are rising worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
When it comes to recall, there is a spinal cord around a term.
Volkswagen launches behavioural deliveries in the second half of the year.
Europe's biggest automaker can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel business, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, VW's core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus once again burdened overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
Globally, the VW brand sold 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than it did the previous year.
In Western Europe alone, after China became the second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than the same month last year.
In Germany's home market, deliveries sacked by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker July figures mainly to two selling days less in Europe.
Moreover, in some core markets, there has been a buying restraint through "changed economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU had also burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the US, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of Lower Saxony continues to be glimpsed by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be found.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to show further sales opportunities from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen during that time, worldwide at 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had rigged with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to be converted to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars did not have a negative impact.
Following the conversion of the vehicles, there has been no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car office issued a "guarantee-equal" certificate to customers after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee," as it was called in company trips on Friday.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This would have confirmed VW representatives at the Federal Transport Ministry last Monday.
It was confirmed from the Department for Transport that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," stated federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has given a guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not be reduced after the conversion and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "guarantee," as it said in company trips.
In the broad term "warranty," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will come to a workshop half a year after the upgrade, with engine damage, for example - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of customers, too, it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, as it has been said, causing uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements.
That is why VW does not use the term "warranty."
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will require rich savers to pay penal interest - as the second institute in Germany.
Banking chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro- or day-to-day money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an isolated case and sees no signal in it: Ordinary savers would "not have to fear paying for their savings gross penalty rates."
Warehouse banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
This fee will be returned by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over €100,000 on Giro- or day-to-day cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been wary of EUR 40 million for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot recycle.
"Those lie with me in the central bank account and cause a 0.4 per cent cost," the bank chief said.
'i can't go for every million 4000 euros'.
He is now passing on the costs according to the 'polluter pays' principle.
Leaving the cash simply in the safe of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four overs, I don't like the fifth one!" The bank chief said.
Most clients would have understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria declared: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course is causing significant costs for all banks."
To bear them on their own is to be "permanently impossible in economic terms."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounts, credit cards or bank transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits down from three million euros, the Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay across-the-board deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
One banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is slightly more sumptuous equipped by the fortune."
"That can become a problem for a small bank" if it hates money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Co-operative Association of Bavaria "are not currently aware of any further banks charging an outlay rate for deposits from private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold of going negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
Competition is tough and the drain on investors is threatening to compete.
Customers in Germany will not like this in its breadth.
Destination plates: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the commentary section to sow it under the pseudonym Non AlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials wanting to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are in all likelihood aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
Nor is it a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: Older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do YouGov's results match?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk amid a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and veering wild before I stand, holding my hands and saying something defining like: "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds by watching.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: Two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: Eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around the 20), is out for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess already," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snap by email, I hadn't followed him home), dress up the walls of his living room
The reason he owns such a sizeable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: He is now able to buy plates he could not afford when they appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and bankrupt.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late sixties, early seventies that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things where I was presumably a little too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my lap.
WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pipe, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old plates again.
From the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?
It takes just a few seconds at a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to WEZ, some of the older customers took offence at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as some sort of consolation," WEZ says.
That's the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with a lot of people.
It's an easy way to deal mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" An employee blows from a plate stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a plate last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate don't own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would presumably look very concerned while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: Three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More productive, less musicalistic.
We have people saying, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slow to come in.
Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a colorful audience as I go clean.
There are couples around the 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexbepacker pop instead of experimental jazz drunk from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look terribly lonely, but naïve mental trauma is hard to establish when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and is looking at the variation of plates for sale.
She makes a storefront bump rather than a wholesale purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a fallen sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to be mustering the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: A mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so upstairs that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "record art."
But given that any attraction to these items could mean more money to the industry and send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that YouGov's results are true, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning bouncing through record shops on Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while avoiding the startling gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rages over the shoulders of nothing ahning middle-aged men.
Greenlandhai is the longest living vertebrate - video surface
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebral species on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines sharks, says the record lay with a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to crack down on dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to knock down 72 provisional stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, offer hairdresser services or drink tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid and which pose a fire and sanity risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also suggested that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who run the 72 provisional stores, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run communally and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest number so far - following a surge in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time-trial, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be subdued.
"I continue to watch the World Cup, stay confident and fight on," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday ahead of his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place at the Zuckerhut.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's timeline," Martin said.
He would have to analyse calmly what would have led to the debacle.
At the time-saving World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
'i'm going to look at everything we've changed lately '.
"That includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who lost to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5km more than three minutes.
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund missed semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's winning streak ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world rankings-32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA-No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, plagued by back problems, was only able to get through her upset once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel / No 2) still had the chance to jump into the preliminary final round.
The Australian Open winner hit out at Britin Johanna Konta (No 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had fetched a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had last been in 1992.
Never before has a German duo stood out in an Olympic single semi-final.
Group rises in start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge adventure - Microsoft also wants to take advantage of that.
The technology company buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the takeover, Microsoft said Thursday.
Beam launched its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
The gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already horning up.
The start-up's staff, which has its headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington so far, move to Microsoft's headquarters in California's Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief executive Matt Salsamendi announced.
As a result, the takeover should not change anything for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly $1 billion.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google's mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser needs to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: New flash devices are being tested in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, which are supposed to transmit tempo lightning in a particularly effective way.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or to clean bridges with temporary tempomit, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is adhered to with a stationary lightning rod.
A durable mobile structure, however, can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery holds five days of continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as pass bans on time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer with each car with trailer clutch in a high-speed state.
So that it is not easily clamped, it is lowered in measurement mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and, by the way, shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
The trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also blitzing with the new technique: France recently reordered 100 pieces, following an order for 150 pieces last year.
Britain picks up silver in 7-man rugby after Fiji masterclass gold
Britain's impressive performance at 7-under rugby came to an abrupt halt in Thursday night's final hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, downs, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' marked defeat, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form at this form.
It could be consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way to go.
Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost only one.
This stroke will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks crack down on GBs out of fun.
It felt like running into driving coaches for captain Tom Mitchell, as the World Series winners went 5-0 up when osea Kolinisau rattled in the corner.
With another four minutes to play, Jerry Tuwai added another tackle from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A heartbreaking tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa getting a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, JASA leapt Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the replay and there was still over a minute of game time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached through another weak teackling of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 lead to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB are still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes at half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long gone off in favour of the South Sea sulanes, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing in the grandstand.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set up the i-Tüpfelchen with another try in the final seconds.
The whiff sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked crushing beaten in the lawn.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final by 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late teackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with trainer's cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotinal gold than at these games and that is what it means.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard throws going down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found extra significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the contestants who sat at the helm, there were three votes in the boat, the echo of trainer Robin Williams, was all-present when they ruined to become the second Olympiagold in the two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a yardstick.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to goose.
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more remarkable than the trainer who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would survive that day at all than was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky he could start treatment in early 2014, outside the season, keeping the break to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so soon I had to get better.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the inevitability of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking about it a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a principal in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week, which may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him; he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close out, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped in the moment.
Helen called for "staying in the process, staying in the process."
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't about to make something Tolles.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair will take a break-out for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took me around six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, "she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe" (Veitensteingruppe), Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is regarded as "exemplary in Bavaria."
A small Franconian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers.
This was said some time ago in the original alton in a contribution by Bayerischer Rundfunk.
Little later, the Sub-French Government's Water Forum paid tribute to the purpose association.
The work of the Veitensteingruppe was "Bavarian as exemplary."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been a staff member for 31 years, 28 years as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Veitensteingruppe drinking water purpose association, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as waterwart in 1985 and appointed managing director of the purpose association as early as 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work to office and organizing activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairwoman said.
As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the remediation of high-volume containers (1999), the re-creation of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no standstill at all and there have always been innovations, because water has meant life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He campaigned with a lot of heart for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
Just a few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitensteingruppe for the reduction of nitrates in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of credit and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterwart and he was a loyal scarlet.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he described the fountain construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult effort were the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, we had to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the Pettstadt high tank was filled with tubes.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will succeed Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other concerned parents: "You have to have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great strides," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was detected with her son, she believed she had to die.
But the now eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something two years back when I sang at Milan's Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he's the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship at Bargteheide - man shoots at life companion
A 35-year-old man shot and fatally injured his partner at a multi-family home in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) about 10.45am on Friday.
"The man has himself called with us and indicated to have shot his life companion," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator was on the run, after he was publicly jailed.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 feet tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a glow.
Meanwhile, police released a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
Meanwhile, the man wears a gown.
The man is not supposed to be directly approached.
He could still carry the gun with him, police said.
Those who see Sven S. should call the 110.
Police are talking about a "relationship act."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not initially want to provide details of the takeover or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
'it's a killing delight.'
"We're not saying any more at the moment," a police spokeswoman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a special intervention command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from eco-electricity extraction are off the table.
German Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) on Friday.
'i'm really pleased that after two years of tough negotiations we have finally been able to achieve this'.
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steelmakers who use gases from the blast furnace to produce electricity for their own consumption to pay for them.
The steel industry threatened to incur additional costs of between 120 and 240 million euros a year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told the WAZ there is now a landmark agreement with the EU Commission following talks with competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG deposit of 20 percent be applied.
But this is not being raised in the steel industry either.
IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own electricity generation.
This will largely establish the status quo of the existing system.
Gabriel's successful efforts have particular significance for the steel industry.
"In view of our 'steel is future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More have to follow." "
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed up in the reform of the emissions rights trade," stated IG Metal chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from excess capacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
The situation worsened last year, when China, the world's largest producer country, put mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import tariffs have had an impact on imported steel, and on the other, economic prospects in China have increased.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
Germany's industry primary has remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
ThyssenKrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual plants.
Some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced a good six per cent lower crude steel at 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Steel Economic Association announced Friday.
After a short increase in May, the manufactured quantity now declined for the second consecutive month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent year-on-year.
The association expects increased output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, spirit, health: Singing does seniors good
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehramt study she taught music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and, overall, more alive, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good to her health and mind.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and sharing with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak out and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly ask for your lungs, you won't get out of the purest in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the federal Labor Association of senior citizens "organizations.
In the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people evokes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-stricken people escape from long-ago events.
When singing, a special performance is also required for the head, explains Lenz.
Focusing simultaneously on one's own voice and a set rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.
It is precisely older people who live alone who exercise so as not to focus solely on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is terrific praise.
The self-esteem also grows as a result of singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I'm long for something, I'll get better and wake up beyond myself - that experience reinforces.
So there are enough good reasons to start singing.
Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if they think they have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - in the case of 50 singing people, who is listening when there is a sound next to it?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, Hackler says.
Singing someone from the acquaintance in a senior choir, you can just join in.
Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with internet searches.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have studied the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the males did not get cold either - however, unlike females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can detect the excitement of cat babies at the might of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to noises of kittens in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have found.
Kater may also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between micking fewer and heavily excited young animals for the males are either not perceptible or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the heir to the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the length and pitch of the kitten screams differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH's livestock farm were observed.
They were preplayed on one occasion by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with shouting of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised high.
The researchers consider their findings to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who didn't yet have their own offspring, responded differentially to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned around more quickly to the loudspeaker when that call of the very excited kitten played out.
This ability may be innate or develop with the maturity of sex.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise on several occasions in humans.
Again, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski attacks with "gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football match is taking place again in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is fashionable.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government proclaimed that the everyday lives of ordinary citizens should not be compromised.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom they blame for the coup attempt.
This does not stop before football.
Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
So the Southern Kingdoms, now living in America, are accused of being members of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by state President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The night-time "democracy guards" in public places across the country declared Erdogan dead Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas working-class club have traditionally not been among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic historical experiences, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree on this - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will be the winner of the "Gala" Cup.
Cologne proved its sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine appearances in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season of playing as his club's top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The fanatic newspaper cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Cup.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the Lions also departed early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only six.
The season hasn't been good.
The Cup was the only way to win anything.
"That's what we've managed to do and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Thanks in particular to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season finishes as a South Lig goalkeeper, set the base for the 14th title.
That's also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
After the coup attempt, Gomez, who was under the agreement of AC Florence and who was only borrowed from Besiktas, announced that he would not return after his European holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the magazine "Kicker" quoted Clubchef Fikret Orman as saying.
In order to do so, however, the stormer would have to be prepared to waive around a third of the annual salaried estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman made clear: "We cannot pay his Florence salary."
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Rio Olympics
34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been jailed twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other over-the-top athletics singers can only laugh about it - they struggle to win medals in Rio.
The issue of doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who filed for her starting right tackle shortly before the Games after a doping lock, was mercilessly knocked out and busted out at her start (100 metres chest).
It offered a whimsical scene: With a set smile, she was still stumbling into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that she was not going to pick up gold, the audience erupted into a jealous storm.
Yet there are many more athletes to go to despite doping past at the Rio Olympics.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-metre relay / USA): The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been jailed twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bout, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion has been running even faster than before; he is the world's number one in 9.80 seconds over 100m and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-relay / Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit out a six-month lock in 2010 after she was proven to have taken the pain agent Oxycodon.
She had strong toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus / Croatia): 2011 Olympic champion from 2012, world champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic bested the knowing intake and was jailed for six months.
The four furthest swords this year go to the account of the big gold favorites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-relay / USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positive in 2010 and was locked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was to blame, Merritt proclaimed.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400m is the fastest man in the world so far.
Iwan Tichon (hammer throwing, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has ever received so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after testosterone doping was detected at him.
The now 40-year-old also had to hand out Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 EM title because of testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games because of a ruling by the International Sport Court of CAS.
At 80.04 m, it ranks second on the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned food supplement, the lock on the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran out as early as July 13.
Bomb enterror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - multiple dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned to travel home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, affect Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Foreign Office is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
In the roughly 200-kilometre south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin had initially exploded two bombs in a hideout district on Thursday night.
According to police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Two explosives went up again Friday morning, killing another person, according to authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the Detonation near the Patong beach popular with holidaymakers, according to police figures.
In Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, another bomb then exploded, killing an urban employee.
The explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station, according to authorities.
Finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the Southwest Coast and Chumphon on the Southeast Coast called for several injuries.
One assumed a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," army general Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning.
'We're assuming it's a coordinated attack '.
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a Bangkok spokesman said.
Rather, the bombs are believed to have been laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities would have received intelligence notices over the past few days of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact timing and locations.
It is still unclear which group was behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to step up security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment neighborhoods.
There are still minor bombings in Thailand, but most of them are not directed at tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the nunmehrigen bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends that it comply with the instructions of the Thai security authorities on its homepage.
High security risk (level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, non-necessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (level 2) applied to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place just days after a disputed referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the years to come.
Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to stir up chaos as the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, considers itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get to grips with the insurgency of Muslim rebels, which has been simmering for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were also killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several provincial offices, constitutional protectors in the federal government have also kept the group under observation.
"We see evidence in the 'Identitarian Movement' of efforts against the liberal democratic order," said Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith, or of the Middle East, are defamed in an extremist manner.
That is why we are now observing the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multiculturalism," "uncontrolled mass immigration," and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation."
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identitaries."
Maaßen said his authority had closely aligned itself with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target audience where it stands," the constitutional protection chief said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with popping music.
This is what Islamists and far-right extremists would do.
This is not a futile advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
This is dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports of "identitarian" contacts with AfD politicians from several federal states.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of that.
As far as constitutional protection is concerned, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It comes down to whether the party in question - in this case the AfD - is changing its direction and becoming so extremist by certain people who are extremist.
So the deciding factor is whether such individuals have a steering influence on the party.
That is not obvious.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said he would not yet be talking about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal sterrorist structures.
There was the Old School Society or the Freitaler Group.
There may well be more far-right terrorist groups or micro-groups that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugees, or attacks from other extreme right-wing motives.
However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not visible.
The previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects involved in attacks on asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or right-wing supporters.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected CDU, SPD, or left, but who were then radicalized by far-right sentiment."
Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habte becomes Internethite
Not always do the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous performance of ROBEL Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut-off was selected.
In the social networks Habte subsequently became a viral Internet nethite.
Indeed, with a 48-second backlog, the 24-year-old finished his lead and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old is still attending the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special right to start from the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more familiar.
Because in aesthetics most athletes are running, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quick made the first nicknames the round.
Some media outlets described him as "ROBEL the whale."
The English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he struck first with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100-metre free-kick, played no part in that.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete alone in a forward over 100 metres free-kick.
Frenetically, Moussambani was mocked at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim just eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop in New Square has been beaten.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsriederin had left her shop at 5.30pm on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15am, around 250 euros had disappeared from the box office.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
Video surveillance is also non-existent.
Trump doesn't see the looming election defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Florida.
Should it become nothing with the election as US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative video.
He will then go on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, that would matter relatively to him: "Ultimately it will either fold, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," the Republican nominee told CNBC in a phone interview with the US television channel.
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said.
So he named US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was emerging.
Post Office rises to trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in driving is apparently great.
The Post Office plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter, too.
The Group intends to start trading in the transporter shortly.
The Post Office also wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to enter into the sale to third parties," a Post spokesman said Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packs, to other businesses as well.
Post-Executive Board member Jürgen Gerdes had said there were repeated requests, such as from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn Group intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the post-own fabrication, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and planned a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he had said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we are changing the whole fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership steps down after disappointing business figures
Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely by surprise.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it clear that the longer the success he promised would be, the more uncertain the chair of chief executive Matthias Hartmann becomes.
Turmoil at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the world number five of the industry is facing a fresh start in terms of personnel.
GfK board chief wants to leave company at year's end
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As early as 1 September, the Management Board took over the previous Executive Board member, Gerhard Hausruckinger, and informed the company.
He is to officially assume the role of a "board speaker" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "differing views" on long-term business policy alignment.
Details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday.
Anyone who will be leasing the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders had last been very disappointed with the continuing failure of the restructuring that began years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the most recent poor GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually be restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, so would the quandts," it said.
The company had also been unable to halt its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
At €361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at €721.2 million.
Profit in the second quarter in particular weighed on the company's sluggish value given its difficult economic situation.
The company's value write-downs of €139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience Division, amounted to a loss of €148.2 million.
GfK still had a net profit of 19.7 million in the second quarter of 2015.
Accidents - Bus slips into crumb in trenches: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident involving 43 senior passengers in Krummhörn (Aurich County) on Thursday.
Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her claims, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a tour operator from Eisenach had to evade an accommodating Laster, who was travelling partly on the counter-carriageway.
The bus came down to the right of the road and slipped into a trench, as a police spokeswoman Aurich / Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people were unable to leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an emergency helicopter arrived at the scene of the accident on the state road 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken by a scheduled bus back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators urged the lorry driver and possible witnesses to report themselves to police.
As of October 1, 2016, fees per cubic metre of wastewater for the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl waste water plant will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the Azendorf plant, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvements are needed.
After an overpriced calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach County Council, it was found that undercover water was running for these sewage facilities.
On the basis of legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.
Starting October 1, 2016, citizens as well as Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.
Fee increases range from 48 to 67 per cent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the charges for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover coverage from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increase in charges was justified by Schmidt's fact that all three waste water facilities are relatively small, with a very low waste water level, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
Moreover, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, a considerable amount of remediation and repair expenses were incurred for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf waste water plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl Pumpwerk, the almost 20-year-old conveyors had to be overhauled from scratch and after almost 20 years of operation the Lopp pond had to be disposed of, the sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below current levels in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that, in the case of the low waste water attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "fully offset."
In doing so, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared from major entertainment costs at waste water facilities over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially as it is not possible to extend the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water disposal organisation to include these facilities because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria booked up for first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest rate (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
Annual average inflation over the past 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%, according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 101.0%, meaning monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed: Food and non-alcoholic drinks (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell on clothes and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blurry, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them that the app would promote blackface or propel white skin as a beauty deal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and evaporated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies hinted at a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos became widespread, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the countervailing of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow face has been dragged to the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural fumbles.
American culture seems embroiled in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that's offensive to a user, "it's much harder for such stuff to go unnoticed than it used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account asking others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," the Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what against."
Others share their opinions, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not release figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a staffing officer who focuses on under-represented communities and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will let her Snapchat account close and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not O.K."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, notes committee of Congress
Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional inquiry committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committees, Intelligence Committees and Wehrbudgetkommites, reported widespread dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how superiors altered their assessments of American efforts to fight Islamic State.
The Central Command, briefly called Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence, typically disguised by senior CENTCOM commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws at CENTCOM extend all the way to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
While there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their prerogatives to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they were in fact," the report noted.
For example, a CENTCOM affiliate publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear." Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, said in an opinion piece.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tips changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans called the task force into existence after it was attributed to them that analysts worried about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.
The report, released on Thursday, will be complemented by more detailed findings while investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the CENTCOM reports are underway by the Defense Department's inspector general.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an overly limited process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat in the commute, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in an opinion piece.
That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave overly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats declined to find any hints of White House intervention among CENTCOM analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation were released Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported from investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which were recorded following complaints from CENTCOM analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, admitted in an opinion piece that the Defense Department would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation is still underway.
But he also admitted that "experts sometimes have thoroughly divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence and defense ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have backfired on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
Last year's accusations, however, have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls the merits of more than ten years ago, when a CENTCOM analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how George W. Bush's then administration, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and wasted little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, after indicating government offices, noted that contrary to government statements, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have had a significant impact on the terror group's financial position, as these provisional refineries would have been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, that finding was not made public, The Times reported in September.
Centcoms's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA win fourth match in women's field hockey, showdown with UK faces
A day after she scored three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." She said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
But she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 win against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place within their group of six teams each.
The first-placed runner will take a little longer out of the way for the strong Dutch to lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have caused a surprising whirlwind by their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
BAM was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey sledge in her hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the cadaver.
Then came 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and with that, things started to turn to the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the order of business in London that we now have.
We have been able to take the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goalkeeper in the first half of the game with a backhand shot from close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough play and held the score from 1-0 up into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lured the ball into the goal to give the American a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for United's goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who has so far had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampolin
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a rambling baton between competition and pursuit.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning baton, which is stretched from the armband to the swimmer to the turner to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a women's swarm with Grübchen, could well have been among those well-known names broadcast at Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertisements if he were a swimmer, turner or even feeder.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate every event the same way.
Further away from the centre, some in the shadows are the sports that are not universally recognised: Air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the chest swim and may it rule for a long time.
But if I'm humbly likely to make arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived the past 16 years that many of those, I questioned, didn't know it was an Olympic sport at all.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it all the way to the final.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians the ones for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, in part because it sounds more fitting for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish quoting of its never-ending uplift - but also the grazie of gym and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "jumping board."
Rising winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling moves (turning, stitching and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."
Two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls need to go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes down to goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down the pitch.
Not only do they hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but they also hunt for another intriguing goal in television broadcasting: That of the world or the Olympic Cord.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel a bit tiring about watching these games myself.
The trampoline offers a respite from this.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is on top.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she prunes down, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is competition, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vomiting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If awareness can only be achieved through the anxiety and objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley is expecting his post-air, new fan base.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia came amid violent government resistance.
Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed in gunfire during clashes with police.
Has Ethiopia just collapsed?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, expanding into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was relentless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, presumably from last year or early this year, show security people beating young people with sticks, while they have been forced to take a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is Africa's most populous country after Nigeria and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia; few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was far from a model of democracy - human rights organizations have continually led government repression - opposition in the country has been curtailed, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert's expanses.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have these no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the opposition's last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle over this zacky, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts worry that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface after years of warping.
The first seems harmless: Smartphones.
It was only in recent years that very many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Athopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flat-land areas.
But that, too, is just changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence agencies, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublicized illness in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special envoys to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a stir was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were seemingly pocketed by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though there were fewer than in recent months and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in tackling poverty.
But, obviously, this has not prevented the Ethiopian government's internal malfeasance from intensifying.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Gondar, an amhard town, Tigray-led business, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drones flights over neighboring Somalia, even as it recently announced it was closing that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very thin greeting."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, suggesting that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group was not meant to be serious.
That clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's communication skills as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.
It also puts his fellow contestants, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements he might not even have meant.
After making the suggestion at a campaign rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backtracked on the claim Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really didn't intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation was completely serious.
When conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump tone down the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee didn't want to know anything about it.
The latest storm of criticism praised Mr. Trump as he tried to shift his campaign's focus to the economic situation because of falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the issue again.
Speaking on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm forward to his defense.
In late July, he drew strong criticism for suggesting that Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared, "Of course, I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then ruin it back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction comes out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even quieter tone as his poll numbers have declined further.
A new poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist released Friday showed a lead with a large lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal running mates in the unominous situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said, so he was questioned on the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, awkward" television experts who were trying to understand him and said, "You can't do it!"
Some of the Democrats spotted about Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidential race.
Once squeezed out of the market over price, Café in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shameful cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices have been squeezed out of its Bedford Avenue store front.
Business Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals entrusted it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is exempt and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good, too.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outlet, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained much.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sauced onions.
There are natural travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"A lot of old customers were also squeezed out of Williamsburg by prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would make her way up.
After the verb closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"It became clear to me that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even though on that day she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003.
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter by quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter too," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a groom about the fact that the soap business took over the old business space.
Indeed, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cafe's cold-baked coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get on their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to issue it soon so his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has other benefits.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-baked coffee into the bottle.
There's a chance the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: Stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato pure and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman was told in her book, "97 Orchard," about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear in Harper's publisher on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the Flatiron District that has been in store since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheeseburger with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate truthline with potato peeler and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbrats, this found the couple fit for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era.
"Rich food was very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
CoE grinded.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field staff and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes such as breads and casseroles became staple foods that reclaimed Kasserolle as a "wonderful species, eating remnants," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetising ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the focal point of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serviced luxury.
Peculiar mixtures were tried because calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't fit with each other.
It was typical of many of the house economy recipes.
As never before or since, fiscal economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - promoted the country's eating habits like this.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamper like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, the reports about the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich cake-eating stance, are tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he stored like the millionaire man of world that he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and was wearing a Smoking.
He was gloriously unrealistic.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife Eleanor not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, bringing in a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt "led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science applied to food.
The couple admitted to having better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "She actually made people sick."
There was the windshield incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: The plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There was no sliced cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone appeared somewhat reluctant to put a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
CoE picked up a rebound three times.
Like a Can Do budgetier, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a facade bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that so far has saved nearly 60,000 lives, according to Bild newspaper.
2900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk, pulling people out of shattered homes and providing first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil rights activist showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went viral in 2014.
It made Syrians the shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
However, as a hero he never saw himself, according to Bild: "For me, that's the real Jihad."
'When I'm dying trying to save lives, I think God sees in me a martyr.'
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four facade bombs over the Gothadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffering from breathing problems.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his final words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had been meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: Oldest spinal cord is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years of age.
In one hour, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, averaging just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes over, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a saturated 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.
This slow-paced lifestyle, however, seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks will become stonewalled.
Just lacked the evidence.
Greenland sharks are hard to watch, after all they mostly live in the Ice Sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they mostly appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Prey make these sharks anyway: In an animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal, while another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the icy sea and search carcasses that torch down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sharks that took fishermen off Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created even before the sharks are born, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960 "s, when nuclear weapons tests sent larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal at 220 centimetres in length, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it may have celebrated its 50th birthday when it examined it in 2012.
All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which is generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 2pm for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335, while the record shark, at 502 centimetres, is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenlandhai females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals, at 392 centimeters, was probably on the threshold of maturity and its age at 156 years old, Greenland sharks apparently can be found at least one and a half centuries ago.
This, too, is likely to be world record for vertebrates.
That such methusalemas live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon stuck a 120-year-old harpoon top at the neck, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparse flame.
So they mature later - and aging more slowly.
In addition, in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, which causes the animal to lose heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in the double pack
The local council focused on issues related to construction in the most recent meeting.
With relief, the panel took up the notice from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally, the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin."
Once the land, parcelling and construction issues have been resolved and applications for measurement have been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straslweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - section 1) is no longer in the way of prospective buyers.
The Municipal Council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential village of Schönau will appeal to young families and wealthy senior citizens alike.
As it was said, as of now Bauwillige can report to the town hall, the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the parcels at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to enquiries about the settlement of other industrial enterprises, together with job creation, the local council decided to amend the area-use plan, which was only newly created in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
As a result, the industrial area already designated there is extended by two parcels towards the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The City of the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and firms from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's competence field financial markets and property markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to operate further from London out of financial dealings across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been admitted to the UK.
That's just taking advantage of big U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the eurozone's largest banks, as well as other key authorities, such as European insurance supervisor EIOPA and risk regulator ESRB, speak.
In Paris, while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate so directly with oversight," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is worse off in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also boasts easy-to-use commercial properties.
"In Paris, it's not at all easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtländer says.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's management consultancy, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg 19, Dublin 33 and Paris 37.
Although quality of life is a matter of preferences, "with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers, despite the Brexit vote.
The balance of power also speaks for this: In London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, some 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. attorney ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs it incurred from the Hepatits C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of a $200 million damages payment for violating two Merck patents related to blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge exposed a pattern of wrongdoing by Merck, including opinion and other unethical acts.
In bringing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to forfeit the costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took ownership on lab work, to which Sofosbuvir confessed, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have recaptured full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently cracking down on the city after exiting the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clinton's earning 10.75 million in 2015 and paying 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which revealed an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, is publishing his tax returns of the past decade, along with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion piece.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and pulling back on his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything before tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already voiced concerns that his refusal raises questions about fortunes, his donations to charitable organizations, his business conduct and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already lashed out at the issue, posting a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to release his tax returns." She said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times economics journalist cited a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers on Friday, stating that that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the campaign.
Clinton supports a settlement named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here, called for Trump to be exchanged at a meeting around their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subject to a tax review by the IRS and that Trump was "afraid" of voters rather than tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton's 2015 tax returns showed that they received only USD 100 of her income as a wage, unlike most Americans.
Her main asset was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $US109,000.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms at them filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea to do so years ago, has stepped up its promotion, along with US nature conservation, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Ever since we developed the... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.
If not deterred, a so-called "Chilicloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is rotated up to the ignition.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts into the air with a bang and sprays fine dust to Chilipuder.
A hint is usually already out to hunt the elephant.
One last possibility is a shooter shooting a gold blaze into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City council decides unanimously: No kiosk rebuilding on St. Goarer Rhine bank
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects of tradesmen with Kusshand are accepted - after all, it is the retail trade in the core city that is regarded as markedly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony, which is under construction.
"Basically we welcome new tradesmen, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk doesn't fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director crushes Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media outrage after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli preselection as it would have "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" let out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country selection list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?
Wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call centre.
Looking for a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
Israel's ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were appalled and dismayed by this event.
It's really very shameful.
The fact that this has taken place in this very hotel chain in Germany is even more disgraceful.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the incumbent said.
The incident sparked quite a resonance on the internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "succumbed" to the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Ashamed of you," it was said in another post, noting that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations of itself and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There has never been a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the quick election list, "Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
Police deploy tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive students apart, causing police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
Under the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been deposed by a Senate vote to resign from office.
Russia & Iran trade suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With sanctions lifted, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in doing business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking on existing ties with Iran, while new firms are willing to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan goes missing from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, Russia's foreign representation issued around 35,000 Visas, primarily Reisevisas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are broken, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilisation in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: Drink market in forest fire attack
A robbery happened on Thursday night on the drinks market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
While holding a gun, three darkly dressed people who had their faces mummified demanded that the beverage market employee hand out cash and then flew first on foot and then presumably with a silver-coloured VW Golf.
The police do not share how much money has been laundered.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
The perpetrators must have travelled towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and fled from the gravel car park opposite the entrance to the car park with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made any observations at the time of the crime (at around 7.45pm) relating to the robbery should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer release
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and young people of the social pedagogical daily group / social group work of the Children's Protection Confederation Nagold spent with their caregivers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located Freizeitheim Hardtwäldle, the life-joyous group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group had fun on the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited for jumping, swimming and planting.
Children and caregivers were pampered with their own dishes, such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebron Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger.
In workshops, beautiful jewellery from pearls and stones was created, or a Roman-mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings on fire and the final "Bunte evening."
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned happily home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gates of mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna seafaring unit were on their way from Villingen to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to bridge the time leading up to the next Roman voyage of all ministries in probably two years, the High Minister round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were checked and finally the Bishop's town of Freiburg was chosen, where this year a special pilgrimage destination was offered for the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening of the gates of mercy on Fribourg Münster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Saints made their way.
Earlier in the evening, parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crucifixion and given the pilgrimage.
From Horb, the journey was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster Our Lady also stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was taken.
Each day's tours were surrounded by a short impulse in the morning and evening by various prayers, songs and written texts.
But also on the way, the Minis always stopped at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgrimage lyrics.
The parish homes of the local parishes were available for the nights.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller arranged for a tasty dinner as well as dinner and breakfast.
On the second day Furtwangen went to Gütenbach.
Day after day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to descend around 500 metres in sweaty heat and then be retracted.
The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the closing stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster later in the afternoon and went through the gates of mercy.
Here God was thanked with a small impulse.
In the evening trade fair in Münster, the Minis arriving at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-worker Markus Obert.
After the service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristei and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scots Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had embraced, with the Jungspund making the legend proud as he stormed home to clinch a victory from New Zealand's favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth-place finish at the rail world championships in London in March despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the assailant Jamie Staff.
They did so in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealand international won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was close behind after his round but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy shift made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when these rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After triumphing in 2012 alongside Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell off the train after a weak start.
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels with all the GB flags in the gallery like London."
We've been together for the last three months as a team.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress over the past five months, expect us to have successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it's in the realm of possible he'll repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.
That would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That would be the same as that of Hoy.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win on its own.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They scored in 3: 51,942 on goal.
The world record, winning London gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will surely be the focus.
He had argued with envoy before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced to world record time in 4: 13,260.
GB's team relies on its strong rail cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a char of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
It played down drama in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, looking at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland's meltdown due to repeal of energy deal questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract will be canceled, lifting all supply contracts, as the energy company announced.
That move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to run the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as melting consumes around 10 per cent of Victorian's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry meltdown, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's meltdown in Portland loses money and risks closure
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three other owners to cancel their contracts.
The facility is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting," the company announced.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security deals," which should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL expects that contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenue," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million accounts in "anticipation of a termination."
Alcoa said the decision to book out the contracts did not impair Alcoas's "ability... to run the meltdown or ensure the power supply to the meltdown."
The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still guilty of an explanation as to why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts are warning of the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic conditions.
In reference to the analysts' statements earlier this week, head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumed around 600 megawatts and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, that would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And for us as electricity producers, that wouldn't be good, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and ran on Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to weep," Kendall wrote.
The cover's unveiling followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they planned the cover of their sister's classic twist and end.
This represents the cliché-tinged act of almost every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought up the phrase, "You'd forget that we would have you?," with the honesty of a cartoon canine on a broadcast pitch at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls take part in that publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were seen on it in April 2014), yet the cover of the magazine's September edition is a league for itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume more similar to an image tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertised from the 832 pages of the bearer 615 pages).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that images of the magazine leaked ahead of the official announcement over the past two years.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities who are modelling" than "models who are celebrities" have been on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga won the honour.
But even with the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the journal as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - will fall under the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of it applies to Jenner).
They're really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the final cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of lemonade.
Of course, Jenners success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenners's standing in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the mistress of the moment."
Those feelings boiled high again when the news came out with Jenners appearing on the Vogue cover.
But resorting to the displeasure seems to be over the top.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's literally a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertisements for your grunting of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sold pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she is seen on reality TV, presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Local law centres expel 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid agencies are turned away from local law centers every year, while the industry is grappling with the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those with no means for unjust delusions and the like - are already being turned away in their request for free legal advice and legal counsel.
Legal services from the community, which are already overly leveraged, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are scheduled to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
The director of Queesland community justice centres James Farrell said the latest survey of the National Association of Local Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly laid off - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more helpless people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the general attorney general and federal justice minister, as well as senators from Queensland George Brandis, to immediately repeal these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when facing legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of local law centres and their customer communities, as well as for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inaction after it was announced that their campaign manager for North Carolina in February directed a gun at a staff member while they were in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini admitted to having waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realising that "that would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right pointer finger on the drain, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee," Bordini admitted in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he admitted in the indictment.
"Guns don't have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini admitted.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a stir when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action in case his rivalin Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the campaign for breaching due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental harm.
Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks was unavailable for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded to.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are emerging for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This yielded representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north could rule narrowly further, this is not possible, according to the poll figures in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to position the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD plunged to 24 percent from 35.6 percent five years ago.
The party would thus be just short of the CDU, according to the poll, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would come in at 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country with 19 per cent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are reluctant to return to the heavy-duty country day with 6 per cent (previously 8.7 per cent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country at 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin House of Deputies (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU gained just 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They would still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but ahead of the left with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time, at 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, by contrast, that the Pirates would miss out, as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
Today's successors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty knocking.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would now range for roughly two high resolution Selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the western pocket format."
In fact, the new mobile phone could for then standards a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the Communicator was to be reached.
Even access to web pages was possible via an HTML browser, albeit tortuously slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen were found.
Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The cell phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft.
The market now dominates vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online every now and then, this is everyday for a lot of people today.
There were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015.
Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold; Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.
Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
Add to that the well-run business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough in the mass market did not come until early 2007, when Apple chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: A music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all by touch screen easy to use.
Apple's winning streak began, still today the iPhone is the group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the aftermath.
They eventually vanished, Blackberry struggling.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is taking a selfie 20 years after its invention.
Today every German looks on his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We must all learn to put the smartphone away, too," said Janina Kugel, the Siemens Board of Directors for Personnel.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must steer Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, that represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we ran a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us at London 2012, there will be such people who will think that the challenge of enlargement has gone too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question it asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many rather than individual.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of witty growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.
We have a terrific team at Heathrow, which has implemented an £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, built amid the world's two most frequented walkways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third catwalk, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Games of 2012 have been a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time we steered this Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in 'cat and mouse game' regarding ad blocking
According to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking equals a "cat and mouse game" for companies that make money with online advertising.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lockups on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blogpost in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding regarding its advertising ads to make it more difficult to detect ad lockups about which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blogpost, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her battle between the show-loving open source community and the bypassing has already been underway since the invention of ad lockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad-lockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad lockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue facebooks.
The company has put it aside on ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesman shared.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook's investment in such a step seems worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would upgrade its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users, this does not represent a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman charged over suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was overrun by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday during a suspected suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill herself.
She still died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard but some have still not been identified, police said, prompting those as well as any witnesses to the incident to sign up.
An investigation has been opened into what is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a clash avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that motorists did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent manslaughter after driving over and killing a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become conscious on the street, the court declined.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere, might once have exposed earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously hinted that Venus's slow turn could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests the Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet presumably had more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protected it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the Giss model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for nearly two months," Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus resembling evolution previously suspected by planetary enforcers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As their hydrogen entwich remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, who as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy steps down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a low participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternatively president / general manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed that decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in an opinion piece.
I've been thinking long and much over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today of this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him just the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards.
He led the club on 112 points and on first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Northern oil workers resume talks, set off strike
Labor disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," it states in a joint statement.
We will be holding some all-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start early next year to readdress the issues.
Unions said their latest strike, which is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year cut rates on its North Sea contractors by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation reinforced by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with Labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes to have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
2016 is expected to be less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in star stream of plejads
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejads' star launch.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in orbit, as well as the connection between rotation periods and the formation of planets.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Plejaden asterisk is 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this star group, which originated about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are turning fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars, they have a bracing effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate starts to slow.
Kepler measures each star's rotation rate by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are turning more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "of the plejads, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the cluster of plejads is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The cluster of plejads provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We would like to know more about how the how, when and why stars are slowing down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hanging up their "dance shoes."
In three newspaper reports, Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Plejaden's rotation rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
Controversial baseball star steps down
Tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays one last time.
"I love this game and this team." "
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant from Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was elected the league's most valuable player, winning the World Series in 2009 with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million a year since 2007.
By the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will be serving as a consultant and youth coach - at full pay.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez a long time back with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees managed some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in key stats show similar stats.
Yet the 41-year-old is unlikely to be included in baseball's glory hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, his appearance outside of place is so controversial.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to having taken banned steroids on "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was jailed for 211 matches due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered a prime suspect to have received performance-enhancing funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal battle, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done me a favour for 2014, because I've played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said southward at the time.
His farewell days don't go smoother either.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez frequently had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour." "
"My job involves trying to win every game," guessed Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans of the Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifting expert Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are being overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
Ahead of the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weight theorist Adrian Zielinski have been tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these news comes at the moment.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the precursors over 50m free throws.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B sample and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a notice: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, news of the positive sample at Danekowa sickened, leaving the 33-year-old himself on the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been provisionally suspended, according to the BNT, the B sample is said to have already performed positively.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov promptly spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, adding: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight theorists from the chronically doping-affected nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
Also known on Friday as the "Adrian Zielinski" case, the London Olympic champion in class to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabole steroid Nandrolon three days earlier, as was his brother Tomasz.
Both deny taking, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of athletics, the Danekowa case in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Federation had banned the entire Russian team except for one exception because of systematic doping, even the runner-up nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the earlier offences in China had also caused fierce confrontations among athletes.
So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
'Sun Yang pinkes purple '.
"When I see the podium over 200m freistil, I want to pass myself," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," this one said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit out a three-month lock.
Data clay: So perfide blackmail hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims at least once in the past 12 months, sometimes multiple times, of an attack using blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been targeted for Ransomware blackmail.
Forty per cent of victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
According to Malwarebyte's observations, the perpetrators increasingly specialize in attacks on corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the possible ransom to be blackmailed will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a frighteningly rapid evolution of malicious software," explains Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski in talking to the "world."
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been woefully rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake among private users, firms are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production will cease.
Accordingly, if a Ransomware fails, the damage will be higher.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to disrupt business altogether, with one case putting people at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have been the victims of attacks on a number of occasions, whose patients may be at acute risk from the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
Yet 80 to 90 per cent of firms that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators "demands in the face of gridlock in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and are trying everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers examined the conquests and contact with the blackers, and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to raise more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from Ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the job, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more likely to be three or four people.
Programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price of between $1000 and $10,000.
"Included in the delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one logs into one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then charge spammers with spreading," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off Ransomware using file back-ups and scanning software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful detection, perpetrators will instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski.
As a result, the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new objectives on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in industry 4.0.
One for all
Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: A little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be decidedly flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, is rather small, passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not work narrowly at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side drops slightly.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
Not only is there a 453 l boot available for upset and 1026 l for folded backrest, but there are the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: The rear bench seats can be folded up like cinema chairs, providing storage space that is 1.24 metres high from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot can be loaded well, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is likely to do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorization: A 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
The steering, though, is likely to be a bit more direct.
The equipment in the tested top version "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
Among the safety systems is the City emergency brake assistant (works to pace 32), the collision warning system and the track holding assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because when ranking, he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller responds to traffic sign recognition and reduces speed when needed.
The full connectivity, though, exists only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB- and one HDMI-booths lie underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol from EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14) argued that liability could only be possible in the event of dangers typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Sickness case: When the organiser pays
Sick holidaymakers will only receive money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten per cent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was suffering from diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness attributed the holidaymakers to a defective seawater treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt the trip had been defective with it - and complained to the organiser.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
Although the water treatment plant was in fact defective.
However, the organiser only learned of this shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume by then that the seawater was OK.
So he did not violate his obligation to provide information, according to the ruling.
Especially since no contaminants have been found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The state must respond prudently and decisively at the same time to terrorist threats.
Sure: Our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow the terrorists this triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, that would increase the security and strength of popular support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced another personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years."
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism must again be punishable.
Video surveillance is to be improved and gun law revised in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizières, the most recently widely discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be maintained.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger to citizens, he said, with a view to mental health problems.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers would need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is willing to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Home Secretary has spoken out clearly against activism.
"That was a slap for the snipers in the CDU / CSU," Gabriel told the Funke media group's newspapers (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic.
You cannot ban everything that you reject, and I reject the wearing of the burqa.
It is possible to talk about rules in road transport, for example, or for witnesses in court.
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate action and action with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet spraying and a tightening of the right of residence will no longer bring security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on motorway access
It regularly ducks on the bypass road - here's a picture of November.
But that is to change: The right-hand side is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are in congestion in professional traffic on the ambient road every night when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit, the state-owned road building extends the right-hand side lane by 700 meters.
Motorists can then spill directly from the hammer road to the right.
The big advantage: Traffic is divided up more early, improving the overall run-off on the much-traveled section of the state road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation of Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the Zubringer nerves motorists mostly between 5pm and 7pm.
On weekdays, the backlog stretches as far as the bridge over the Albersloher way and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle ear on the B 51 just before the Weseler Straße exit.
From here the traffic is directed only by a single lane over the motorway bridge.
The second lane had to be rebuilt just over three-quarters years ago.
The reason is that static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the capacity to accommodate heavy goods traffic in two ways.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working-day congestion will last cannot tell the competent state-owned company.
However, years can be expected: Because the bridge has an official residual use period up to the year 2034.
For the extension of the right channel, the state-owned company deliberately selected the weaker time during the school holidays, because disability is to be expected.
Traffic will pass by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offerings for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The invisible house."
The club nima's and the boy theatre are now planning a music project.
The association nima's allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended an presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" by the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the association nima's, 19 pupils between the ages of eleven and 15 attended the staging in the Little House.
Since the beginning of the year the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migrant and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class's youngsters had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia, and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, and would speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action nonetheless, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming playtime as part of a music theaterproject.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, spectacle and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language communication are in the planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
Given the increased refugee numbers, the association reckons many classes want to participate.
Rain instead of star snaps: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a dash through the bill for the star-sniffing guckers in southwest Germany on the night of Friday - yet there is still hope.
The night was ill-suited to watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of Welzheim's observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will certainly see many star snaps in the sky.
The star scales are perseids, which, at 216,000 kilometres per hour, are among the fastest star snaps.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which goes up in the north-east.
Relaxing night: Tips for sleep disorders
In the evening you pass around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep even before the wake-up call.
This is far from relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults experience sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unrecoverable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders speak?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Wethem, member of the Board of Directors of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Schlafmedizin.
However, what one understands for the most part is the insomnia, which means one-way and one-way sleep disorder.
It is precisely this sleeping through that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, mental or behavioral factors, as well as medications, may be behind this.
Sleep disorder is often the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially in a depression," Wethem says.
And it may be that different factors are related to each other.
For example, if you have a ribbon disc incident, you can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps start to grapple with everyday problems and worries, this is an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you don't sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired by the day, you should go to the doctor's office.
The impairment can look very different: One is struck off, tired, unasleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily attractive, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
To relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any settled sleep doctors in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universität Medizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the doctor, advises the doctor.
This can help with investigations to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the slaughterhouse, and what happens there?
Fietze explains how to study in the abattoir, for example, in the case of snarls with respirators, in the case of illness of daytime fatigue, in the case of sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just please don't do lunchtime sleep," says Fietze.
After cabling, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one is wearing a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a fist on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling captures the sleeping end.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of pitches you can put on for better sleep.
On the way, it counts: Regular sleep and resting times, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not watching TV for sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken via Facebook about the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the short-track world championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
Now former DSV athlete Markus Deibler, via Facebook, has faced protection from his dogged ex-teammates.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a €20,000 premium and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night of Friday.
The support system for swimming is bad, but the controls on doping are very good.
This will not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the issue of doping or even run it.
"I'm not saying that here the controls are to be stopped," he explained further.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported as early as nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly the way it should be done with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent inspectors of the WADA / FINA before the World Cup / OS may not participate," asks the Wahl-Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream shop.
Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civil investigators from Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The crime suspects had committed multiple bag and luggage theft as a gang.
At around 9.30pm, civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport area identified a gang known to police officers from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year, taking joint, labour-intensive and particularly professional action.
The specialists of the Crime Commissioner, 34, can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically in order to commit crimes.
In total, they had laundered more than €15,000.
The Rigaer street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police rank it as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a fresh-faced nursery and a biolad.
To the facade of a grey house, someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a lidl, which is also due to be demolished soon, is already being built: By 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district," as the relevant real estate firm Friedrichshain calls it, are being billed preferably with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the building number 94: Once it was occupied, the inhabitants now have lease contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly advocated tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the cadterforge, were cleared by 300 police officers on June 22, police patrolled for three weeks, according to official testimony with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house by number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers pulled out under the juvenile of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in front of Späti.
There is a primary school and nursery in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who brings up three children here, are mainly generalized by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiez who, by the majority, wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench that the Berlin Interior Senator and the police make up between squatters and their neighbours does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainzer had been cleared under a major police order in an outright street battle, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and some are still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election berliners from all over the world: With them, GDR-era residents and former housekeepers now share their jaws.
That also makes itself felt in rents, which have increased by nearly 60 per cent since 2009 in new rents.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: They are recognizable from reclaimed slices or freshly smashed facades that have been thrown with paint bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence."
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are directed almost exclusively at police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as acts of violence are concerned, it is reassuring: The people in the 94 are their neighbours, they certainly were not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in the rig.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more with each other than anywhere else."
Neugebauer deliberately pulled into Rigaer Street - and stayed.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get their streets back: From the police, politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed authority over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to take them away: Through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd out the old residents.
"These are ultimately condominiums that aren't interesting to many here - here are more likely to be people who aren't so well-heeled," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what should we do if someone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed by colour bombs: The house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Those who come should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on the ground.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The Social Pedagogist supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: Refugees, working groups for refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the jealous Wollmilchsau, which has above all a problem.
Some people had meant - less apposite than targeting the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - when the administration wanted to advertise the job.
An administrative authority was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, a keen Wollmilchsau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with local people, and also behind the scenes, as well as network activity.
The 31-year-old has been at it for around six weeks.
It has a 50 per cent vacancy on three-year terms.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, adding that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
New containers soon stand in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
Local authorities are responsible for the accommodation.
They must shelter the refugees in their own or rented housing.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.
Responsibility switches from the Land Council Office to commune and job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his flat.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, but you need private apartments, Deuschle said.
That is why public housing must be seized, as it is called.
So new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is only with apartments that it is not done.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
As well as a firm lead, it's internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and outlets for refugees and migrants that need to be fundraised or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine told customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help housekeepers, do charitable work - and that's motivated and very proper, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That is "not employment therapy."
However, activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rough.
So here too, administration and honorary officials are jumping in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and that they can easily bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that they can't help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, they will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who don't have anything at all." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: After recent events, are the two afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some might call naive," but a risk of regression cannot and will not rule it out.
However, the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also a matter for the refugees.
They fear that the perpetrators of the attacks will bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So key and honorary officials on the ground and in the region need to look for activities.
In doing so, they always have in the background that a new bump in refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
To answer this question clearly is to shy away from politics.
Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already used to integrate the existing people sensibly.
That's around 100 people at the moment, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglaries with helicopters searched
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly entered an apartment in a multi-family home in Lindenweg about 8.50am on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and beat the Unholde into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 feet tall, arguably masked, wearing both bluejeans and black hood pullis.
They flew toward downtown.
To investigate, police deployed several strike crews as well as a police helicopter.
The fencing proceeded without success.
Perhaps the unknown struck up before the fact near the apartment or when they were fleeing.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on snack
Following an attack on an Ulmer snack, police are investigating six suspects from the Rockermilieu for serious land peace violations.
In housing searches, evidence and narcotics had been secured, police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rocker-like group had thrown bottles and stones at the storefront of an snack in July, according to police.
After that, they are alleged to have attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
After that, they fled.
There was a damage of EUR 10000 at the snack and adjacent building.
According to investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish aisle.
