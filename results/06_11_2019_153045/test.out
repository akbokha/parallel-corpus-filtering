gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyr@@ am@@ ides &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses were remin@@ ded on their opening evening , they pursued at home in the fast g@@ stop at home .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I had fear .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that ended the riding career again then again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he doesn &apos;t wait for photo albums .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ th@@ ilfe delivered the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sport@@ pyr@@ am@@ ides .
it is not equal to distin@@ ctions from the sympath@@ etic athletes .
Federal State Cross , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ blatt , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold US master winner was included on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the foreigners , the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous around the hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports meetings were come on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part , the lively society went to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and the trade agreement T@@ TP - we want to prevent Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential elections however , however , are among the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic query .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and war@@ ns to damage like the state of economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton would regul@@ ate the economy to death and to death , he says .
himself , he would be different , claims Tr@@ ump .
he will return to massi@@ vely massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax movements strong - for private professionals and businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to meet and needs dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would have increased , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
it must be invested in the must , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton nearly equal .
the democratic applic@@ ants announces even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes for the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ ical Te@@ ach@@ y wings of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , so there could be more common discussions .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and restore coal promotion in the USA .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement .
Clinton wants to strengthen its investment program to enhance renewable energies and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want to be it . &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - also at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the pol@@ ite fish trade agreements , do not want to sign up .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but simply protect the American jobs .
they should also be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is to do in this question is not clear : once he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says he shall not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one page is Tr@@ ump , who wants to escape the economy and citizens to spur growth .
his critics keep him before , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich who wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost for everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany they often are trau@@ matic .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each has a baby that is a maximum of one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he gu@@ sts with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is co @-@ managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and is among others on the subject of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Assi@@ stance .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there is no one - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a juni@@ per in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated : every woman who comes here on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars , because they are polit@@ ically persecuted because of them torture or death , or because their families they send them as a hopes for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced to see Hon@@ or of Hon@@ or , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives it off .
on the escape the way goes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a bottle of water for a bottle of water is a sexual action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that as soon as they are ank@@ ets in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
too , there were often women in refugee quot@@ as often as min@@ der@@ ine and worse .
this leads to that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north , it is estimated that they are .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly about the earth , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help , it &apos;s more accommodations for them , calls B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District minist@@ ries are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they were of a similar project as in Munich in its jurisdiction area , some with no no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are something in the governments of governments .
in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Under@@ ground and Central fran@@ ken , there are only one community accommodation or own houses only for all common women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the Committee &quot; Rights of the Woman and Gender Equality Committee , in the European Parliament , calls for women separated from men .
in a study which was published for the Committee , it is : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated together , it can come to - for@@ aging - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the shower room should be separately accessible and easily accessible for women in the study .
how much the women feel this protection of this protection , one can read on the And@@ rang , den of the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since himself has been speaking , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : claims to new working measures
Deputy Chairman of the Assist@@ enz@@ ym@@ ns have called their union with new working measures in their disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded the entire Council as of the beginning of September more working measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC told that there was a minister to adopt the wor@@ ries regarding the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistant and medical doctors have been voted on the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A in July .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government had remained calm &quot; to problems that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the J@@ DC Management Board , the proposed new contract has been challenged to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposed new treaty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today placed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a run programme of calendar work that begins at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes ar@@ ising that assistant doctors made this year six times in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical doctors , with that the Treaty should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors was forced to be for@@ ci@@ ble in England .
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of outer lateral &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and to announce an official end of eight months in the war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot assume that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation on most of them .
there was the hand , yes .
but Put@@ ins sm@@ iles worked nar@@ row@@ ly , and he did not shine warmth , even for his return conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve even better .
the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an would have been on the same day when it would never be a little bit .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin @-@ radi@@ ating , sustainable cooling revealed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten .
rather , the cause of crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft in the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow from response to time was w@@ ut@@ ili@@ ated .
Putin was divided and accused Ankara to have fallen in the back .
it even was even bigger , since it was committed by a true friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be re@@ build again if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
when it seemed to be , the Turks would bear the debt for everything .
on serious , the alleg@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials reported that Erd@@ og@@ ans had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place just because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an , who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily associated with all friends who can get to last month after a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat of his am@@ tes .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey had also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic pictures .
Russian sanctions hit the Turkey hard - in particular the ban of bat@@ ches , each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and batch companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late ais@@ onal an@@ ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state @-@ of @-@ state television budget fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it in this way : &quot; tourists lived there for long , tomatoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara has risen to the West , since the response to the tried power was considered a weak answer .
in addition , the persistent Gro@@ ll come to the EU acc@@ eding negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping on it , from the cool atmosphere , and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the west .
in Ankara , the Russian State of State won a bonus that he asked for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the chosen state of State .
that &apos;s prosper@@ ous for Moscow is a self @-@ under@@ stand@@ able , which itself has a deep fear of reg@@ im@@ ing .
the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace of the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it was an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of outer lateral &quot; : two countries , which are cast off from the west and wor@@ ried and now banned .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between both the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow had recently restored the role as a peace tre@@ ason , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual websites .
it could be a record that after nearly three hours on first discussions both President on the press conference said that they had not even had the subject .
the President of Turkey ad@@ mi@@ ed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to pray these too .
there is no unique con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member of Turkey enjoyed the Russian mar@@ tial jet - it is certainly better to talk about two Heads of State at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand has to be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Board .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank with the global Am@@ b@@ positions of the Bank .
the bank has been dist@@ anced since then , when they had to be saved , eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this period , brand str@@ ate &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands .
it supported the international sport with million pounds on Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to have more national brands in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange to Nat@@ West switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other brands for private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our investor brand , as well as to the brand , under which our employees will be employed , since we now become more at a bank of brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has become a global brand for the global brand to be a global brand .
I say now that we have no global targets , but local goals .
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own congregations and our staff will work among these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the us@@ ability of various brands in his sports Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop new brands , for how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; he said the board of Chief Executive Board .
it would have been very angry for three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ launched these stamps , therefore I think that time has come .

the three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy about that it happened at New@@ market because I landed 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ quet Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am facilit@@ ates and very hum@@ ble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel to win the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ day winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recruited career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone in just a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma fans have been enthusi@@ astic fans for this sport since years .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already gained 6,000 win@@ nings , if he would not only be a weekend and big break @-@ up !
Frank@@ ie has already lost nearly 30 years of winners , which is great .

it was nerv@@ ous .
a whole range of large tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug for@@ b@@ ade .
three years ago , at the beginning of three years , he returned to the first time when he returned from his six @-@ month sperm , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to beat his branches , and return to his best form .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori had previously said earlier that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests until his at least 5@@ 0,@@ 60 years of age .
Russia &apos;s Vladimir Putin &apos;s Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin was released un@@ expect@@ edly in his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin for many years from Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport policy .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin without speci@@ fying reasons &quot; the release Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy , has been appointed to his successor since 2012 .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo in Tokyo .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later protocol manager and Office leader of the government son@@ als .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important role of the government to support your activity as state leader in regard to law and checks to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his position and recommended to V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made secrets Moscow .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of time confi@@ denti@@ ally in Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast@@ ed both men that the Chief of Staff was back on his own request .
but despite the harvest for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
is here the result of a kind of power ?
no one currently doesn &apos;t know .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once again recognized as a potential President , was to lead to Russian environmental policy - fell on big sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his comments on Putin , who are quoted on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked to trust this very complicated post in early 2012 - they could almost say to trust for four years .
as it came out , I have been chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin became a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , to whom he trusted in most .
once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term of President of Russia , as a third term of putting into the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , nearby ally Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became President three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ er Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 bn project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ er Cross@@ ing with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what means the bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covering the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ se@@ ile .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 until May 2017 .
business Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown is a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to passed away from the country on the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ er Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of engineering crafts@@ manship in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the cut between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck a hei@@ k@@ le activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
altogether , almost 79 % of the total fires are in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks are today in Ros@@ y@@ th an Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , what means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tor said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of a pione@@ ering light and deep construction .
after installation of the last street cover@@ ings and its connection with which in the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling the northern Zu@@ er@@ brücke 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very he@@ ap@@ le activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tons of weight and a gradient of approx . 3 % had to be moved to the top .
hei@@ cle , since the tolerances , which the team works , are tiny - on each side they were only some millimeters .
fortunately all very good .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the very strong winds did the boat outside the reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on the street they met the ex @-@ life end@@ anger@@ ed man .
when the two women hit the apartment once again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend .
who builds brown and cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green : investors must be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes to the next advice meeting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first line comes to the question : who is supposed to build an affordable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
SPD vice @-@ president Christoph Fr@@ mann said : &quot; we are going to build us with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas have to be 20 percent of all apartments as a social dwellings . &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be created in stock .
however , the large armed point in the town hall was , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build private surfaces on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to have investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as an independent apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing development program that will cost millions of costs and will still be financed , to incenti@@ ves for incenti@@ ves .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as possible as possible .
the Lin@@ ke wants to increase hardness levels for investors .
regardless of this , Brat@@ mann , b@@ aked themselves a dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
the concept concept is implemented , which provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the experts .
yet the program is not completely free : for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built in .
but how do you compare the loss of another about 1300 affordable apartments , whose funding will run out in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments only by 2020 .
to prevent this , the plan@@ etary spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the current ties of the city .
furthermore , it would have to be thought about to pick up the apartments again into the price .
this is possible in the West city .
to dissolve the problem .
because in the West city run at the end of Fri@@ sten .
about 1800 apartments could get there back into the price of cheap apartments .
only : we want the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social apartments in the west city will be dra@@ stically increased from the goal of the so @-@ called passage .
a concentration of social weak in just a few city share it should not give it more .
the gre@@ enery therefore expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .
Questi@@ oner Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must be the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it worth
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child could not go out more after outside , but rather you prefer to spend your free time , on screens , became in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , there is therefore to get people from the sofa and to be active .
at the time the screen was at the beginning on TV , then to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other .
I have made me of course at the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that were created on the characters used for the video games in the 1990s ( later it created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of populations decreased slightly before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ ym@@ s and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones to the outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , which were followed with a GPS , once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( over a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; can be taken cap@@ tive . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the course and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that determines the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
cardio , a app for Apple Watch , which persecuted 35,000 users , divided by the Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks just the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring in &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day to be active , &quot; because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and people will look like that .
nevertheless , the meaning of sports cannot be exceeded .
who regularly drives sports , reduces its opportunities to cross cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that can lead to them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that there is people to do something in the open , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ rical gam@@ ers who must always compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it is a breakthrough .
even if you could follow smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
the New will lose its maturity and use it with time .
however , because of the poker success , there will be more games that will un@@ ite apps and virtual reality with the activity will be un@@ ite in the real world and help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen

the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly presented before the silver medal winner and the Final Five &quot; team@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ akers in Ali@@ ya pattern .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ f at the Swe@@ et@@ bal@@ es during the retail price of women in the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American player who wins a multi @-@ campaign and the fifth , while they fixed their reputation to be the best of their generation or even ever .
they broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and their long voyage took place at the end .
this success is the same League as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports with new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates her sports art , 15 World Championship med@@ ail@@ ers - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ asi@@ bility of 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton of her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gymn@@ ast in which I have ever seen . &quot;
it waited for a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of athletes , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ race her , after having won gold and silver in the retail business of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while she was able to re@@ tire co @-@ retirement team in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long distance to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
one part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , which would look at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school bugs in the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any combined competition competition , a victory of victory that will keep as long as it wishes .
even if pattern was slightly led by two turns , the picture shows the picture .
Swe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es keeps the world championship titles - l@@ ute .
she again brought back to 15,@@ 433 on the Swe@@ des and set it on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man emb@@ ell@@ ished them gently than her du@@ g@@ rief - a pure form@@ ity - and tears flow on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue egg , as the vision , which they once described in their collective book , became reality .
the power Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year old team members , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their floor , they threw the audience of the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes was und@@ ou@@ bt@@ ful .
what is it concerns , so the 19 @-@ year @-@ old 19 @-@ year @-@ old has been a new meaning to the end of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial mur@@ derer shot in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot that were killed in one of the dead@@ ly attacks by Phoenix , while they had stayed in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a ride , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators are eight shots taken from a hand fire@@ arm while sitting on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another car , can be read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder did not have been the result of a prey that seems to be a prey , since the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of an adult victims .
the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting bre@@ wery led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential objects were killed seven people in nine months and were injured two more injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to have the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were associated with the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness shared the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities published a police report on the shooting , which was left onto an empty Pick@@ up Truck for half an hour before the triple murder and was assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball@@ ots from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ scope : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves S@@ ingen , Toys , and of course his mother .
but like the least of its age@@ ing , Edmund Micro@@ recipes , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I create it not .
I do not create this .
I have not left me .
what is not right -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her husband told that Edmund could never recognize them under the circumstances that he may not survive once again .
some doctors were even so far that they beat him to institutions .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do still , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund was able to sit down until his third year , neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling nor can &apos;t speak .
but he makes slow progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund für &quot; Please sing me something &quot; out . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language at &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- says she . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ scope hal@@ e has a variety of causes : genetic disorders in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ans or Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus In@@ ner .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they do not know it .
I haven &apos;t asked more after the forecast for long time because I don &apos;t expect that she can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to have caused a hop@@ eful rating for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spher@@ es , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several sh@@ ading violations , including the l@@ end , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at his transport into the hospital with consciousness .
&quot; he has made a lot , his small body was sol@@ dered of balls , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boys was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family divided the transmitter that it is expected to be back .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old age .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is found in a critical condition , the transmitter reported .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police found whether it could be under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators part@@ ed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it was apparently come to a cross @-@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were returned to different storm guns , over@@ crow@@ ded the facts .
it seems that it is definitely acted by a continuous fight .
on the road , on both sides of the case , H@@ ül@@ sen found .
so it seems to have several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; divided police p@@ mann Anthony G@@ in@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there came to no arrest and the police currently checked reports that the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit the arm when they played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
they recovered and the police still sear@@ ches after a susp@@ ects .
why do we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I want to present myself under the Women &apos;s Women &apos;s Women &apos;s Day , and that is more than one reason .
first I &apos;ve been working with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US was never so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din ist and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is round , makes every proud .
this team reflects the United States .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of these sports art .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
with the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas became a surprising Olympic win@@ ner@@ in and America .
now , the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple world master Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone has won the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American player who won gold medal for women &apos;s individual combined events .
Mann@@ a member of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of these sports , but you do not see gym in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four gymn@@ ast inside the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as train@@ ee .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is a expensive sport , and Turner at first line in private turn@@ able , who will receive parents , competition , it@@ iner@@ aries , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . the list can be seen in any other .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are located in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , Turner first receive a complete training and that is for the families a dev@@ res and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since then they started with the Tur@@ ning .
we must be inspired by the municipalities Au@@ n in@@ numer@@ able , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and lightweight turn@@ around .
I founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
during my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for more than 15.000 urban young people ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and trained national and international winner .
in September we expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ asts that earn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong advantages for health , as well as for the school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ f and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team Gold and thank you to start their way to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .

&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to act now to raise awareness and concerns the wor@@ ries of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , the assistant doctors have made obvious that they are ready to perform other working measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a stroke of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ine@@ operations and 100,000 dates before , since ambul@@ ance and specialist doctors have been involved in order to grant physi@@ cians on the strikes .
the ministers had been hop@@ ing to termin@@ ate the dispute over the modifications by an acceptance of the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .

Daniel Mor@@ ning , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistant to termin@@ ate the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working action can reach nothing of only little , but loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nurs@@ ing and their families only worry , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ respon@@ ness is to bl@@ ossom in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on request of a government report due to corruption from the ministry
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness has led that the widespread election was igno@@ red in Muslim congregations like a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es used the police , elec@@ toral Plan and Rath@@ geber to consider evidence of election abuse regarding Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now a ant@@ it@@ ab@@ rupt one , said that the insertion of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that the police should be allowed out of elec@@ tive voters outside of elec@@ trol@@ ley .
he recommends that voters should lead to prove their identity in elections .
at the time a voters must call only his name and address .
the report suggests , not distances on the finger of a person if they choose their elec@@ toral voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the press more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official verification or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for election campaign , but also the municipal government before the wider correlation of corruption and financial aid workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the East of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the Mayor of the Mayor of Rah@@ man should be sent to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; and that he had brought his critics with Rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ oma to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led by &quot; his campaign based on the basis that it is the reli@@ ev@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ ted or the result of a im@@ it@@ ation , if one person choose another .
Sir Eric said that it was in the whole land of evidence for deceit .
in particular , he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent mail election - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidates of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to acid the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ ils to prove the identity
in his report it is : &quot; as proof has been attached that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic min@@ orities , particularly women and young people , in order to choose in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Albanian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belie@@ fs regarding eth@@ nic@@ ations and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations made to acid the system , including the ban that political activists of brie@@ fing documents , to stop &quot; Election &quot; .
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , requires even har@@ der registration tests to prevent the elec@@ toral directory of immig@@ ration and social bet@@ ru@@ gs .
options to be considered to ask elec@@ tors in front of your identification .
not distances on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on orders to an automatic mail selection .
prohibition to process political activists and envelop@@ es of correspondence .
the police enter the powers to set up voting stations for election stations .
an amendment to the Prosec@@ ution of the People Act of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Representative Act 1983 ) facilit@@ ates an amendment to the Indi@@ ct@@ ment of the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
photograph@@ ing in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees go through the elec@@ tors alone in the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls on Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a lit@@ an@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a series of reasons for reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of elec@@ toral registration departments of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our land contributes to the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the poss@@ essing and spread of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ als in Rio
fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio are a week about the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band that has proved itself as an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ og@@ in of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not the only one to the gold @-@ fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you have the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens F@@ lim@@ wor@@ ms , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ans that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Dutch experience .
the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team at Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates double @-@ singer on the wheel train , many people were on the Internet , as a certain arch@@ ers of the Z@@ ym@@ us from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team at Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter , after pictures where he looks like to see the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to that he had already heard his childhood in his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see any big simil@@ arity , except the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy der Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a well @-@ looking guy , so I recommend it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will be und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly more in the center : the striking simil@@ arity between the British wide @-@ spr@@ int Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya pattern with their large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through as a double @-@ singer for the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan the &quot; athlet@@ ic version of the In@@ c@@ eption actors is
another continued comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ ail@@ len@@ ess Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ b@@ aked skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian von Fans was att@@ ested , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that other simil@@ ar@@ ities are also fallen
theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares .
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet has th@@ inks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas which has its own wonderful , broad smile , that resem@@ bles It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ D@@ onal@@ ds thought that his microphone is switched off , when he will leave his own opinions on the end of the 4x@@ 200m Freestyle gardens .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ator team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; I could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; was said to be a Swedish &quot; ? ? ? ?

Ai Y@@ an@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Freestyle hus@@ bands for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cr@@ iti@@ que against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to set many at him .

another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t it that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we spent yesterday night in our spectators at the show and our followers on the social media .
in order to be clear@@ er , Byr@@ ons comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequ@@ ately and an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ Donald in the con@@ sign@@ ation and tried his re@@ mark to justi@@ fy that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .

of course , there was no confusion , and I &apos;m sorry to me . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark empi@@ rical about woman who tast@@ ed in the middle of business under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman drew her clothing in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ p@@ ants .
in order to im@@ ent@@ ate the situation , it numbered them how they looked out in it , and put them back into the shelf .
they continued and tast@@ ed four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants , before they put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son who had been at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she returned , and left the business without buy something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area standing , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ set , moved their own stock@@ ings and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t tried to find something discre@@ et place to do it - she simply stood there , fre@@ ch like Oskar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every star@@ red , having gone back the under@@ p@@ ants , which you didn &apos;t like it again , since they were back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that all of you had nothing pleased to meet again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not too anno@@ ying to think that someone would follow - or over the person who had to buy the under@@ p@@ ants , who had tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how do you think any under@@ p@@ ants that any other person had had any other person who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
David David@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the garments from the sale , after she went - what is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it , with a new couple of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had her , and did not have washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the fore@@ case that occurred on Tuesday 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it something safe for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ o in New York to find out how to move with armed men at the distance .
regardless of whether you come from the front or from behind it will show you this video how you turn to your rob@@ bers .
if you turn back up from behind , then you should see yourself as a first , so that you can see your attack@@ ers and give yourself from the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you sm@@ ite the face with your free ell@@ bow .
beat him with the kne@@ el and turn it with the kne@@ el and turn the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move towards him while keeping the weapon upon him .
when attack@@ ers from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon , and turn it , so that the attack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
dissolve the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his grip before moving forward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est of your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the tast@@ eful places of Europe
a British rice under@@ gone his immune system and dig@@ nity of serious examination - by taking some of the most dirty and most common places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel agent Ian Wright , 51 , out of Suff@@ olk will re@@ tire at a Euro Sch@@ ein , a jel@@ ly on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a car@@ c@@ asserole of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to make the resistance of its immune system .
before leaving every object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show yourself and let us show what he is going to let .
but the experiment received under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought to check the car@@ c@@ asserole of a train toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely im@@ per@@ vious to im@@ per@@ ate , but actually there are more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as its own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he ab@@ le@@ ased , more than a bad re@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its gut , by which he travelled through the world , as well as wonderful things ate .
from public funds to train stations until go to the cra@@ ck of toilets , the task set up his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health is concerned and I have set all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in the film he was just justified to his reputation .
the only thing that he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res is fresh@@ ly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet who refused to refuse after its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res was over 4000 units while fresh hands have a few more than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel movie &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacteria number of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst , which I have turned in a toilet , close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I &apos;m not going on here because it is inside or in@@ scri@@ bed here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company took Mr. Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to do something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and explains the benefits of Pro@@ biotics .
we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings through which we ended that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in health health will become a global phenomenon
instead of only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to prepare more information on an interesting way for more information .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ or !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me now tell my respect for Ian , when he had tried some of the things I have ordered him , like the Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was simple to bring Ian , to perform them , and others in which this was fairly difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ eries on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents of l@@ actic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal bacteria , and 58 percent said that they contain at least occasionally products that include l@@ actic acid bacteria .

Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it fears that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute album for people here , and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is too .
the couple had three sons , which lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family had added the f@@ umes with basics , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drug , and exc@@ essive cry .
sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was placed on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ elop@@ es behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under the circumstances , the age of rub@@ b@@ ish was found .
in the property , in which past drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wood di@@ ps are torn down .
neigh@@ bors said that they were fighting on the road and had to be called the police regularly
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ated them and their partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by the neigh@@ bors who had made their lives to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was administered to the family with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the crow@@ ded side of the Municipal House , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were cast into .
he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it cl@@ ed the ten@@ ants to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to their family because a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
that was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds to be terrible for their neigh@@ bors .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , who have to come to us and have made the information provided .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neigh@@ bors and medi@@ ates the message that ant@@ elop@@ es is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all have over 20 .
a tasty mattress that moved back to the ground in one of the bedroom of the house after delay on the ground
workers of the house management are now divided into gar@@ ris@@ ers , which is surrounded by the house
in 2014 , police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ don received a fine of fine after having found guilty of a threat of class B in trade fairs .
she claimed that the money was for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in 2013 at a car accident .
after they were without Ob@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms and walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that it is ten@@ ant del@@ og@@ ni@@ ed to keep himself to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall announced that the delay is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not hold on the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who are thinking about without self @-@ dict@@ ations , as well as to those who were killed by such a behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ elop@@ es behavi@@ ors who continue to operate with partners to protect our congregations .

Donald Tr@@ ump spatial t ″ tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally con@@ serv@@ atives federal states in traditional states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced the weak@@ nesses of his campaign campaign in the previous republi@@ can High Castle Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ safe mul@@ tit@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he cast 16 ri@@ val@@ es within his own republi@@ can camp from the race , the doub@@ ts grow in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
false reports on his candidate , he took his well @-@ known media .
Republi@@ can High @-@ bur@@ gs W@@ ack@@ ing

a survey conducted by B@@ ey@@ USA in June according to Tr@@ ump , and its competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump indeed , but not with the distance , which are common for republi@@ can candidates in the state of the state .
Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview of the Sen@@ se CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump to the question how he would stop again to stop Clin@@ t : &quot; as I have done it so far . &quot;
and if the back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end of the grounds of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is okay , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump said , who should submit to support the support of his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better effect .
instead of what would be the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for the congress more than the arms .
Olympia : turning fr@@ aud in D@@ oping test
the IOC wants to teach a discipline Commission to the case .
after the second d@@ oping control in Rio de Janeiro , Kenya is threat@@ ening for the second d@@ oping control in Rio de Janeiro .
after an emergency testing in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to establish a discipline Commission to examine the case .
a ken@@ nel function told that the earlier Sprinter and present Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village a Ur@@ in @-@ Trial under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ ate F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich released .
this was the Team@@ line Ken@@ ia by D@@ oping control devices .
the IA@@ AF world association has the IOC to strict information about the case to strict investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker is distributed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and took itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample submitted and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i .
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for training controls in the world &apos;s anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was founded in 2015 in Beijing World Championship fourth over 800 meters .
four days before@@ hand , Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics four days before .
it should be informed about cash payments athletes of his country about an@@ gled D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested in Nairobi at his return on the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under special observation at the IOC after many d@@ oping control .
during the announcement of the IOC more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics were und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the vis@@ or .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functional control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
in the consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose d@@ oping control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the country &apos;s athletes won most medals in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television report the ARD have always collected once again , that in Kenya d@@ oping must be easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .

in Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
in the orchestra excav@@ ated the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a couple of wor@@ ried Mary .
she reminds of her lovers with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first because she is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mari@@ as &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I am Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I @-@ Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is h@@ ug , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have considered Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so to work for us with you .
she is an unexpected man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ments : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you can see it in any of its movements , in its bli@@ sters , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s all very important !

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass acc@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and fits Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialog and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects short @-@ term protective seek@@ ers to flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believes in the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard occurr@@ ence of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish municipality in Germany expects a mass destruction to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short term I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium term with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continued to fight the min@@ orities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government already passed over the months of Kur@@ dish with pen@@ sions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the escape .
after the failed p@@ utsch , se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal eth@@ ical Turks are added after the failed coup .
many will begin to start in Europe when they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes away refugees , produced in his own country refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Minister of Staff accused the targeted site of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical towns .
to increase pe@@ og@@ an on the remaining cur@@ sions to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks , already in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government demanded that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its tra@@ ilers . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; hex@@ ag@@ ile &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critic is also taking place in Germany .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
fire mark@@ er than Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers , teachers and other graduates the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , and also the Kem@@ alists and s@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialog and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
like the newspaper on calling on the numbers of the Federal Ministry , the Turks had already recognized the biggest group of asylum in Germany because of political persecution in Germany .
at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all considered as@@ yl@@ entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) have been recognized .
in this survey , you will not find out war , poverty or en@@ su@@ ing el@@ ess@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively polit@@ ically , so by state @-@ of @-@ state side .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where you go , where it does . &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from summer elections with - and holiday from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
by 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays already decided at the beginning of the year .
because bl@@ ö@@ der than to date , it is not : summer holidays , heat and landing gear - that takes itself .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the election campaign are on vacation .
most of the holidays that are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a native , so must not choose the country day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , the posters hang up , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and spread out at the end of the votes only .
by September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass only a vote against the people over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , which is the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and remains left at the end of the process .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , you can see from his grand@@ parents .
he travels across the country , distributed as ros@@ es , and pl@@ agu@@ ed a little with the people , as it had already been legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s legendary predecessor .
otherwise , soul &apos;s cold feet have been received and are Chancellor Merkel the gu@@ ilt on the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will create the ascent of the right @-@ wing lists , which is likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top @-@ edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you want to enter the right place of election campaign .
she has been invited twice in German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; the Bundestag &apos;s Bundestag is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Sachsen as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent co@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but there is no man to hear anything from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel once again .
otherwise the north @-@ east CDU goes largely to the usual elec@@ tors in market areas and shopping m@@ alls with sun umbre@@ llas and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , that , co@@ ca@@ des , plays only one &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that you have the basis the base of the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Green Party , hardly available in the times of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU election fighting its Mit@@ stre@@ ites , however , is also self @-@ horri@@ fied : &quot; you have to go where there is where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had won more than 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should be able to create the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern T@@ ug@@ end and put their election campaign large part to the internet .

B@@ 27 @-@ restoration : guest workshops suffer from blocking
on the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to be m@@ ashed .
for the responsible persons of the construction , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are no praise &apos;s praise .
&quot; they did all pretty z@@ ag , &quot; tells El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south end of October , until the end of October is scheduled to be completed by the end of October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed is also responsible for the construction of the construction , even if it comes to the establishment of accommodation drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , it has been lifted and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen and thus has the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again , the traffic situation has been relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the road traffic through the village seems to come back .
there were partially significant complaints , &quot; says the prime minister of the renovation of the Deputy Director of Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ h@@ ach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sl@@ ur@@ ks sought out and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ posts .
what led to do some trucks in residential areas .
since the speed lim@@ bs were not kept , the assembly also ampli@@ fied the brass vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ crow@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made herself on site about the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute b@@ lown up .
the quick@@ est was about 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site , it was still quiet .
for the Business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the road is open again .
in the maps , business people don &apos;t like to look .
but that the B 27 @-@ restoration has led to them to increase in revenues , each one can see .
but some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for other companies , has hardly consequences for the restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the author Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z says of a &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the balance is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local pl@@ ough@@ ed along the street are local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
that is already threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all the guest rooms have met it &quot; hard . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenues increased to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking used its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to put away the half of his staff .
when I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would have been re@@ signed .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the reference to the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that give themselves through the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where some gener@@ ously handled .
in all clubs , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
after all , the family business has been settled here for 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
so that other families are now often found because of the complicated traffic leadership less frequently , it can understand .
if you don &apos;t drive it , it is definitely beautiful .
in the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner did not work any doubt after the end of the renovation work .
in spite of the cris@@ es with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 @-@ construction works on his client@@ ele in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that is already brutal .
continuously , in the name of the terror campaign , is continuously screw@@ ed .
after recent attacks , the Interior of Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a th@@ icker security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ity status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ ant partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his suggestions may be polit@@ ically consistent , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security class .
they call us .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Interior Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the outcome of the Interior and to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; er@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has been a little time after the youngest attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are so much more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cks to take care of the cra@@ cks that is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to set several EU specifications on flight data and ar@@ senal .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities come as well as sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
part of the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second stop for suggestions that were so far to do with the SPD : he wants to put Sym@@ path@@ ogen for terror@@ ists under punishment and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be more difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spatial t of the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he would not hold this yet for reasonable and challenging nothing , which has no od@@ ds at the co@@ incidence partner .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
in some cases , it is partly in itself : it is planning for shi@@ fts and more possibilities for placing people in front of the deportation .
refugees who are to be picked up specifically into the country , should appear before their smartphone and social media account for a safety test .
for centuries , he wants to treat asylum seek@@ ers to have worse than so far - about such a criminal off@@ ences or send their papers to swal@@ lowed up their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally li@@ cles .
man@@ oeu@@ vre still works un@@ balanced and can be asked questions .
and at some points - in the ine@@ quality treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ ties for example - the question arises : what does it actually do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak that the assassination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people in view of the high refugee figures were wor@@ ried about safety .
and things that do people deep@@ est people , let not let &apos;s go out in election campaign .
the inner safety is enormous in focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ lock is great .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD aims at the topic of internal security increasingly in position .
in the past days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Unions Interior Minister , in which the res@@ ent@@ aries also require a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was too hard here to reconc@@ iled tones .
from a return to the double pass , he doesn &apos;t stop anything .
we have satis@@ fying the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ pri@@ ved , be not meaning@@ ful .
and in a Bur@@ ka prohibition he revealed constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is fixed on all corners , and whether it actually is &quot; zum@@ ut@@ able &quot; is to show the co@@ al@@ ant partner .
it &apos;s lots of dr@@ ill@@ ings , which could ensure dispute .
however , the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only time to talk time and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel engines , the supplier will rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the re@@ viewing action there is a concept for a term .
Volkswagen starts out for deliveries to the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ growing markets in the previous year , Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ au can continue to advance .
however , in July the core brand VW , especially in Western Europe and loaded again the total sales as that in D@@ ax took part in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries increased by almost a sixth .
head office Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
Moreover , in some core markets , it has been modified economic conditions in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the Austr@@ ali@@ ans from the EU explained a spokes@@ person .
in the US , where the exhaust gas were first es@@ cal@@ ated , there is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
big cap for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the affected house stamp of Lower Saxony in continued to continue through the diesel sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent is to be sold to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler dropped to a sales platform from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to re@@ arm@@ ament in workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament VW , that the conversion of cars have no negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles there is fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power no deteri@@ oration .
the bus station to customers after upgrading a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate from , but did not say of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company &apos;s office .
reason are legal experts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for re@@ cl@@ ed diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Finance on the past Monday VW representatives .
it was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the editions of my investig@@ ating Commission and the KBA press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that on fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after re@@ arm@@ ament does not take effect , and all typical appro@@ vals will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business circuits .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers take half a year after the retro@@ fitting approximately with a engine damage to a workshop - and this could take back to the new software , even though the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ or@@ and@@ al to do anything with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ or@@ and@@ al , to an un@@ certainty as regards the possible warranty period , as it was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why use the VW &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is required of rich savings in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is only 139 customers that park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single fall and sees no signal : normal au@@ ster@@ ity would not be able to pay for their savings in pen@@ sions . &quot;
place banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100.000 Euro to gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been over 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other hand and could not be missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can not go for any million Euros . &quot;
the cost is now going to continue after the reference principle .
the cash simply in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank should be too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four survi@@ vor@@ s , I do not have the fifth ! , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most of the clients would have understanding and changed to other investment .
only few walking to other banks .
the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; profitable for permanently permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ sions for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , main managing director of the Ban@@ ken@@ verb@@ andes , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay attention to customers who have to pay attention to deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks too much . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a small bank for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks that charge a compensation set for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German People &apos;s Federation and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go to neg@@ atives , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of an@@ leg@@ ers to competition .

destination records : who can buy sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men of middle age love records .
before you come to the commentary part , in order to over@@ se@@ ver him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ Al@@ le@@ ak @-@ Mitt@@ al @-@ Mitt@@ al age with har@@ sh Bel@@ ei@@ ving , this statement leads from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most comprehensive recovery of sound plates do not want to look forward to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which will be welcomed by physical objects , but on Mid@@ life Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have bought a sheet recently , are all advance , according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely population group .
it is also not a hor@@ den by Hob@@ bies : older record players keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog a news report in television would follow me when I carry out a modest street in S@@ oho , a modest grey suit , before I steal , keep my hands and something best to say : &quot; so let us take a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were resident - there &apos;s how a hand@@ ful of a hand@@ ful record business .
I would probably ask the camera &apos;s camera to turn the camera for the next part , where I stand in close proximity to various men in such a shops and try to estimate their age and mixture through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I register of S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight men mean age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men mean age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess &quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
this sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed him home ) , dress the walls of its residential rooms .
the reason why he has such a siz@@ able number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy records , which he appeared and buy items , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably a little to buy them , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is true that those who buy plates , rather be missed , and add : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I smoke not , and I drink not much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets the You@@ Go@@ v @-@ profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave to people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback to buy their old records again .
of the talks I have led , people usually have been le@@ ased to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that were once sold their records to buy CDs now , buy their CDs now , &quot; says he .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to realize that record business has a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ is@@ ites .
according to We@@ z , some of the older client participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med from the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar sound plate covers , of objects , happy bodies .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of possession poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal intellectual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M included in April that nearly 50 % of the people who have bought a record , they have not heard it .
the survey found that 41 % have a record player who never use it , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ table players have .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I bl@@ ushed by a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men mean age ) has noticed a &quot; t@@ rophy of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I do not know a record player , but I would like to make it a radio record record , that I can set them into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it happens definitely .
more productive @-@ load , less musi@@ kl@@ ast@@ y .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who come only slowly .
F@@ opp that has dedicated the sound boards almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , the photos make , te@@ age@@ j@@ ungs and women mean age .
even if the atmosphere has a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ester Syn@@ thesis and Se@@ pack@@ er Pop instead of experimental jazz is used from speakers - is it good to see such a di@@ ver of the customers .
no one of them looks strange , but n@@ ag@@ ant psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be fixed if you &apos;re going to take about 30 seconds next to someone .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around since some minutes in the store and considered the Vari@@ et@@ ting of the sl@@ abs for sale .
it &apos;s more a sh@@ ov@@ ing mel than a big buy @-@ off .
they don &apos;t deserv@@ es much , therefore the collection of records is not real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a pleasant sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how I declare it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop , of which is said that a new generation of record players will have inspired : urban out@@ cer@@ ters .
while I give the ticket to count Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young kids , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of noble , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees her - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far from above that it is impossible to hold it .
it is pure &quot; Disk &quot; .
but considering that each attraction for these objects would mean more money for the industry , and some customers can send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects as plates .
even if my research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v will vote , at least in record business in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors and record players exist in reality , sheet shops and online stores , un@@ taken into account .
these people probably work hard at school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not by record shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they star@@ ving the star@@ ring , 30 @-@ year @-@ old Moder@@ ator , who resi@@ des his own hus@@ bands mean age , aged over the shoul@@ ders .

French court re@@ jects about demol@@ ition from shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vis@@ ory shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing these week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be authorised to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical business , sell , hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few Euro in pro@@ vis@@ ory restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would be paid for a parallel economy , which would not be paid out of the tax and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the nation@@ ally supported Association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock .
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in distress .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who use 72 pro@@ vis@@ ory shops , but dre@@ amed that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais will be &quot; absolutely compreh@@ en@@ sible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger roll when they live only people who live &quot; in extremely short conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , the gener@@ al@@ ant and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice about asylum of protection , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation of speed . in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be effective especially effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic end of the En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example to lack of accident , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway building sites or to re@@ alizing bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infra@@ structures to ensure the speed limit with a stationary bl@@ ender for the speed limit .
a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery lasts five days , the case data is transmitted via a modem .
with laser technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously via several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed lim@@ bs as well as passage through time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ driven condition one can move the trailer with each car by trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that he is not easy , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ pan@@ es and the way also van@@ ished outside cover .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ ender before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the information of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
there are also foreign authorities with the new technology : recently , France has 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening on an ab@@ rupt stop during the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at De@@ od@@ oro Stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , liner and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad for each color .
the defeat was sunk by the silver medal of silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
however , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the shape of this form .
it could be for GB a consol@@ ation - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least one br@@ ite morning a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Head trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every match among Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they lost only one thing here .
this cap is we@@ aving , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks of GB@@ S from sp@@ ass .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co . on , when one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went up to 5 @-@ 0 as the O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with another four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly taken the ball .
a h@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal but it has only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ f@@ eted by a further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like that Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the GB is still running .
so it is also .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for a whole four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua ran Tu@@ is@@ ova according to a Br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started a test for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South Sudan , whose fans sang and dance on the Tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the game Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff @-@ ön@@ te , the fi@@ j@@ is re@@ arm@@ ed , and the GB should be sm@@ itten in the lawn .
previously on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and great Britain pressed South Africa in a hit half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton brake the line with an impressive foot and achieved a gate under the position in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ kling von Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the gain - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than in these games and what will be called .
from the first rowing boat to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ otted to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that laid it on a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ used use , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es , which reflects the surface with elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the species of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind every gold in the Ru@@ ins , a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent to which make the difference , and it was no more helpful than the trainer , who would not survive the day before 30 months when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky what ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a little to the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment early in early 2014 , outside the season , what the inter@@ ruption could begin on a minimum , if this was the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon .
it was a incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it starts .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it too much bigger .
in the un@@ certainty of the victory there went their first thoughts on Williams , who gave a little bit more than anything else and tried to handle his own fears .
St@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it would be repeated , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we are no one , therefore a massive Dan@@ ke goes on him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no races in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not be kept .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were astonished at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to rip off .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to make something T@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted to do no fire@@ works , we wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take out for a year before making decisions of his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic Games .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years in exempl@@ ary for clarity :
the managing director of the Water@@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is considered &quot; Bavarian broad@@ ly exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great water production .
it was called some time ago in the original version of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the v@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group sailed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all of this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin association , was 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ otten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
the communities of the church , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns &apos;s most master Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was stopped as water as water and was appointed Managing Director of the Zwe@@ ck@@ Association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they extend from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget plan , lim@@ ulation of fees and contributions to emergency inserts on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the reconstruction of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , the re@@ generation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the participation of water lines .
there was no stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations , because water life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she pra@@ ising G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 .
he has joined himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose and he has been working on the water purpose , as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he served as a real practition@@ er the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ation Group in front of the Lower Forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller sing pra@@ w@@ ed water @-@ wart Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his view@@ point , he called the fountain building and the restructuring of the purpose .
however , the greatest challenge and the most difficult application were but the pi@@ vot@@ er of the plateau at the church on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night to work with water to be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be stopped at once , because you filled the sky@@ scra@@ per of p@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who follow the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the ris@@ ed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in million@@ aire .
financial loads carried out by the industry from the oil funding above , are from the table .
it remains in the liberation from the Renewable Energi@@ es of Renewable Energi@@ es in the German steel industry , the Federal Foreign Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to use steel manufacturers that use gases from the flood to demand for your own consumption .
the steel industry covers an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry Association .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators will be replaced in the steel structures , all an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent .
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for own production .
the status Quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed .
special meaning have the successful colours of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in the reform of the emission scenarios , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel sector in Europe suff@@ ers from the financial crisis of 2008 under over@@ capacity and a considerable pricing pressure .
last year , the situation continued to grow , as the world &apos;s largest producer China in view of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand in view of the global market .
European producers throw chin@@ ese steel con@@ gest@@ ures price d@@ umping .
during this spring the situation changed slightly relaxed .
for a show , import duties of imported effects , to the other have the economic prospects in China sur@@ passed .
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery .
the German Bran@@ ch prim@@ us Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp remained carefully on Thursday .
last@@ ly , the prizes had been stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp wanted to do not close the closure of individual works .
around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel producers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced at 3.4 million tonnes a good six percent less raw steel than in the previous year , like the economic re@@ unification of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the second month went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year .
the association anticip@@ ates a rising output in the coming months thanks to a improved order situation .
community , Spirit , health : sing for seniors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied all her life : as a young woman she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree , she s@@ ings the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a senior citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample she feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and totally alive , she says .
quite next to them , they do something good in their health and their spirit .
because S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , tell Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and divide the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular merge , senior citizens can connect social contacts and maintain .
because often , social and family structures at the age , one ch@@ orus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their ch@@ orus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ speaking and to organise themselves to the others - a ch@@ orus is a very special form of the compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler is going to sing .
because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly calls his lung regularly , is not so fast in everyday life in everyday life .
even though it goes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen has often have a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the German labour community of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time .
L@@ enz is often observed that the singing or listening of songs are we@@ aned many memories , often associated with positive reasons of their youth .
by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ tured and particularly melo@@ dies themselves de@@ men@@ tioning people in a long @-@ scale events .
in addition , L@@ enz will also explain a special performance in the S@@ ingen head .
at the same time , at the same time , focus on their own voice and to adapt to the other singers - this is a large cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live only alone , do not just concentrate on itself .
another positive aspect is the recognition of which one goes through the singing in ch@@ orus , H@@ ac@@ kler is .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ feeling of life is growing by the ch@@ ingen in ch@@ orus .
even to show yourself : if I &apos;m long for a little bit , I will better and watch over me - this experience is strengthening .
good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he think , little talent , should be av@@ eng@@ ed L@@ enz .
you s@@ ings not alone - at 50 singing people , who list@@ ens , if a sound is going to go on ?
in search of the matching offer , seniors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if any one s@@ ings out of the friend circle in a senior ench@@ or , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn right to the church or church presentation .
many seniors can be found on the Internet .
who has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask help with the Internet calcul@@ ator .
whoever desires to sing , should be connected to a choir , av@@ eng@@ ed H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul good , and has a little Liberation - this is true for any age .
cats react sen@@ si@@ bler than c@@ ater on Schre@@ ie of the young
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover , which effect the ru@@ ction of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
in her surprise , the Mi@@ l did not cut the male , but they kept the difference in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the ra@@ iny of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys at the Mi@@ l of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster on Lau@@ te k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great trouble as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy of Medical School and Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
although c@@ ater react to the ru@@ bs of k@@ itt@@ ens - but still equal .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the ten@@ ds of less and strongly experienced young for the males either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is first authorized in the study , which was published in this Friday at the BM@@ C Evol@@ u@@ das Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and sound level of the k@@ itt@@ ens were differenti@@ ated with the pressure of their help .
in total , nine adult cats were observed from the zo@@ di@@ st of the MH@@ H .
to them were played for a ru@@ fe of little ones , taken for three minutes from the Wur@@ f@@ box and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with write of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample of low sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated on the Schre@@ ie , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker , when this ru@@ fe has played the very cute k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or evol@@ ve with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males responded to ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men for baby animals .
some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , quite as they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

as it was fixed that they will not receive gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are numerous other athletes born in Rio at the Rio Olympics despite the d@@ oping past .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs among the most controversi@@ al figures in the Athlet@@ ics .
he already closed two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger runs from 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest requirement of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .

Per@@ kovic fought the ignor@@ ant taking and closed six months .
the four wid@@ est dig@@ nity in this year go to the account of the big gold f@@ ath@@ ite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger and two world champion over 400 m , was positi@@ vely tested and closed for 21 months .
a means to penis enlargement is responsible , eu@@ kl@@ ed Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were subsequently recognized as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been determined with him testosterone D@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone .
he also recognized bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games , based on a verdict of the International Sport@@ Tribunal CA@@ S .

bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday early .
they had suffered cutting and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left them again .
her home travel dates back to the beginning of September .
whether of further explo@@ sions on vacation island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ eckl@@ on also affected Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arise in permanent contact with local authorities , so fast .
in some 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a excav@@ ated district of two bombs .
the police have been killed in Thailand and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday , once again , two Spr@@ inkl@@ es went high , and according to the authorities a further man was killed .
even by Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular Spa train Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , there explo@@ ded another bomb that killed a municipal employees .
according to the authorities , the Spr@@ eng@@ age should have gone into the air according to the authorities in a flower strike before the re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , there are still determin@@ ations at Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast , several injured .
one go from a connection with explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies of Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee fri@@ days &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to ut@@ ili@@ ze possible moti@@ ves - probably , however , it is likely to be the acts of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical for the attacks of bombs in the south of the country .
by contrast , the Thai police declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist action movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok .
it is necessary to pass that the bombs of the ruling military j@@ unta have been laid .
the authorities would have been in recent days of secret advis@@ ories to the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they are not informed about the exact time and places .
it is un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
the police presented their officials throughout the country , security around important governmental buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement district .
in Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in lies a palace that was used by the King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over years .
following the terrible bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to aff@@ ord the instructions of the Thai security authorities as a result .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ as@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ves and its surroundings .
according to the debate between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to do some necessary trips to this provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unta .
this dre@@ amed the military influence in the next few years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs were an attempt to become chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase bloody un@@ rest , keeps the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , it is not successful in the military , which has been in the ut@@ most southern South of the country for years in the utter@@ most south of the country .
more than 6500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok , some 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shot . most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
according to several offices , the constitu@@ tional@@ ity of the group has also been made under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; identity of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Points for inventory against the freedom of democratic fundamental rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitu@@ encies Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ ed in extreme manner .
therefore , we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group of French roots which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turned against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass emig@@ ration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of its own identity through over@@ strange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitu@@ encies in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority have been closely matched with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; try to pick up their target group because she is , &quot; said the constitu@@ encies .
in general , extrem@@ ist attemp@@ ting to don@@ ate them with you@@ thful voice , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the days of Islam@@ ists are as well as legal experts .
this is not an advertising advertising for his own thing .
prop@@ aganda shall be emotional to people .
young people are due in special ways .
that is dangerous .
it was last modified from several federal states on contacts of &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ ak politics . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said he did not find in@@ sights .
for the constitu@@ ent protection possible contacts of this type only be relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - due to certain people who are extrem@@ ist , its target direction , and so extreme .
it is decisive for whether such persons can be controlled to the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a look at the significant increase of legal offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context , not of new right terrorism .
but we &apos;ve found in the past years that it may be justified structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may be well that further justi@@ fication groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee &apos;s or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves .
however , a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal entity is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the existing groups were based on regional level or social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate felt that many attacks on the account of people went that before not in the right scene in the apparition .
this is the concern .
many of the facts alleged in attacks on As@@ ylum have not been known as crimin@@ als , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or pendant of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who had nothing to justi@@ fy themselves at the hat that might have polit@@ ically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , however , however , however , through right @-@ wing conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ sized s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow to see time no more in the TV pictures .
he disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ it was then moved to vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather a rather sporty figure that moved the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special starting from the international swimming association .

his time , he smote only with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Free , played no role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i won the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i in Sydney .
memor@@ able was the appearance of the swimming pool of Et@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Freist@@ il alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically was fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old scored eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each share of the most poor Gf@@ K will be in@@ quiet .

crash@@ es - Bus non@@ slip in cr@@ um@@ m@@ asks n in Gr@@ ush@@ es : eight injured
at an accident of touring coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to go out according to a opposite number of le@@ aster , partly on the opposite direction .
the bus came to the right of the street and slip into a gr@@ abs like a female spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus could not leave the bus no independent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a not@@ ices came to the accident at the provincial road 2 .

the fee per cubic metre of waste water will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of san@@ itation Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3,@@ 44 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wer@@ age fee will be increased again at the latest , if corresponding improvement is necessary .
after a revised lim@@ ulation , the waste price in Al@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was determined by the Council of the budget by the country &apos;s budget , and was found that for these se@@ wer@@ ies under@@ lined se@@ wer@@ ies .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kaz@@ an is oblig@@ ated to operate the facilities cost savings .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ fare ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to attack deeper into the pur@@ se .
the income increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt , a new calendar of fees for the se@@ wer@@ age of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , or sub @-@ discover@@ ies from the previous calendar period will be submitted .
the engraved con@@ gest@@ ation increases Schmidt so that there are relatively small se@@ wer@@ ies with a very low waste case , between 6@@ 800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be engraved .
in addition , the se@@ wer@@ age comes slightly in all three plants .
furthermore , the subsequent cold period of all three systems were not least due to their age san@@ itation and repair expend@@ itures in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt promised that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by the mechanical ventilation system due to a damage .
in the pump cat@@ ch@@ man , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhau@@ led and carried out during the pond pru@@ dence L@@ opp after almost 20 years of operation the first fl@@ atten@@ ds had to be installed and an additional ventilation option can be installed in order to maintain the water provisions in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expend@@ itures , the continuing education and maintenance costs were considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
Stein@@ häuser made clear that during low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; would be filled &quot; fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs were spar@@ ed up in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ valent after view of stone houses in duration , especially since the supply of the se@@ wage association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be extended by these systems because it is de@@ classified facilities .

Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vor@@ ce and the integration process , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we keep all in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in the matter of race as their older counter@@ player - could rather go out , Sen@@ si@@ bility could expect .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture generated , it is much more difficult to stay that such things are un@@ noticed , when it was the case earlier , the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u , Zh@@ u , who works as a product man@@ ag@@ gression and engineering in medium works to delete their Snap@@ chat account to delete others to do the same .
in a set for medium and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that the cash @-@ oriented contro@@ vers@@ ation should reflect a lack of di@@ fic@@ ity in Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male leadership and ended its up@@ set with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they may meet such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they are working with other skin colors that are there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or safe to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely has left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures to the di@@ fic@@ ity of its workforce , and points out to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently focused a number of personnel responsible for under@@ lying population groups and on internal integration .
Zh@@ u said that she will be closed to their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership of IS@@ IS secret service information , provides committee of Congress
as a member of the United States Central Command change information , order to mark an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it were the actual states on site , agreed to a report on Thursday at a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces and the military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Open , reported how to change their obj@@ ections to the US efforts in the fight against Islamic State .
central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corporate information provided by high @-@ grade Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ sions , recorded a position image of the US efforts against terrorism as it were the actual states on site and were consistently positive as the analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened to Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can Member of the Represent@@ atives of Represent@@ atives .
the guide errors in Cent@@ Com must submit to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail @-@ resistant problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct notice that government tips under Obama have given the reports to change reports , how an@@ alysts saw the pressure of their pre @-@ laws , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many central Command Press releases , statements and statements before the Congress clearly positive as it represents the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com became publicly known that a military return of Muslims could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress held from Kansas , in a position .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of the Central Command has changed the subsequent reports to run the risk by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them was played that an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about the man@@ ipulation of reports to Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are represented by the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange .
on Thursday , the Democratic Members of the Media Services published their own knowledge that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a revised process for the creation of subsequent advis@@ ors to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest Democrats in the committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Ship , in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; policy reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mor@@ al under an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; handed over a little space for different consent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no evidence on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts on a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief Operating Officer , based on complaints by Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press release of the Pentagon , gave no opinion about the Pentagon , during an investigation that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the post during the investigations .
but he also gave evidence that &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding interpretation of complex data , and that the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of this important topics of national defence . &quot;
an investigation on the question of a successful air campaign in the American leadership of Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year however , however , rejected the question that President Obama may rely on the Central Command for ehr@@ ing influences of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism of the Islamic State about the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a member of the author among George W. Bush , looked at the recommendations of many an@@ alysts in Iraq and a little time on it on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker to speci@@ alisation of government agencies that had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ic refin@@ eries had been put into operation since the oil market was used to sell oil on the Black Market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s am commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his superior positive assessment of war crimes at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after she had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ y@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memor@@ able performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t want to contact the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , these know them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are the same in their group with the British in the first place that remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will take place on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide on both the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first placed will take a little bit longer from the track that lead the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising work , four years after they landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey sl@@ ack@@ et in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the header .
then the year 2012 was in which she went for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to use things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the working party in London that we have now .
we can pl@@ uck the ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening he opened the cake in the first half of the game with a return flight from the Middle East .
India had gone without victory in the game , but the team showed itself sur@@ pris@@ ingly , and held the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
it carried a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and l@@ up@@ ils to the ball to make American a 2 @-@ 0 tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book one gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but as good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are too late as late as it is , the Olympic Games are too late .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanently and un@@ balanced , a rapid relay between competition and stre@@ ak .
it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning staff , which is removed from the wrist@@ watch to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ asium .
you can &apos;t turn off the television to listen to a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the maintenance long in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women with dimples , could definitely be sent under this known name , built on the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines by gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade , the sports , which are not generally acknowledged : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and let it have long to rule .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular love , then let me make the attention on the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became the last 16 years so many that I had asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ anz .
although the USA sent the competition for competition , it has never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ tro and won an athl@@ ete up until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for men and the Chinese , and Canadian women for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ski@@ p has a certain outer side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as well as for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert but only a d@@ us@@ eless little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ ographic cit@@ ations of his never to end @-@ w@@ alls - but also the Gra@@ zie of the turn@@ around and dive , which combines two sports , which are essentially un@@ ites .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much means &quot; j@@ umping board . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ genuine and sal@@ tos ) before it lan@@ der on the feet .
they will be evaluated according to the Official Olympic Games according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
bi@@ kers offensive from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their stre@@ ches after gold , even faster , down@@ wards and back , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , down@@ wards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they do not ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but in the television transmission , also another cav@@ ity target : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ship .
the targeted stre@@ ben is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spectators to tears .
but it is also what I &apos;m looking for watching this games as a little bit sensitive .
the trampoline offers a break @-@ break .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly heavy heavy like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , then goes down to the bottom , then effortlessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , just the dre@@ um@@ eric , elegant lines of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen like the competition at the Olympic Games only .
the women &apos;s qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will exp@@ ire as part of an afternoon block of 2 days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ seen in general tum@@ ult .
when the consciousness can only be reached by the attack@@ ing and the obj@@ ection of male athletes - how the male US Turner was recently marked with the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its according to the air round , new fan community .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ant &quot; in Ethiopia , Long one and the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses to say that only protest during cl@@ ashes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia just together to break together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid partnership with a rapidly growing economy .
but during the last months , protests against the government and far more territories were sh@@ aken .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and requested fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was in@@ bar@@ ren according to human rights organisations .
witnesses announced that polic@@ emen came to only un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
in circulation , the video about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals beat young people with poles , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and future , it will even be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated at the west .
American military and intelligence services closely collabor@@ ated with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , in particular in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , when at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia were all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued until the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted by the opposition to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or put into the desert of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you under@@ press the people and they don &apos;t have any other options besides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ af@@ m Tes@@ home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , a teacher in central Ethiop@@ ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest@@ ant .
a generation protest@@ ers .
there are numerous complaints to cover everything from the floor up to the dig@@ nity in relation to the rule of the rain coalition .
after a broad@@ ly critic@@ ised election last year , the party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , ten@@ sions grow along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less en@@ acted , the tur@@ bul@@ ences could be s@@ cour@@ ged in the last years .
several factors explain why feelings of injuries after years is now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ian were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones were more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government shut up the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , hide themselves where they keep themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered themselves together to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest Eth@@ nic in Ethiopia .
Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since equ@@ ations prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from apples , mainly Christian @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they were poll@@ uted to Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in flat land areas .
but that changes straight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are able to coordin@@ ate with a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for approximately 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in trading and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former vineyard leader , was up until his death on a non @-@ sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly toler@@ ated in it , early signs of un@@ satisfaction and special acqu@@ iring to do opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected by relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ra region of North America , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am coming from the south .
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many do you fear that the result will be more blood .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing from the government , according to the information of analy@@ tics apparently , and then stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ zi@@ en , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of the un@@ rest went relatively fast .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for its visionary infrastructure , as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ship , as well as for its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the inten@@ tions of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and hat@@ red against the Tig@@ ray is always common in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests are the USA and other Western Al@@ lies in an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it has been recently closed that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy in the West , he will not want to merge that its association ends in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lord Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin hike &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama in IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign returns that his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the Islamic State of Islamic State .
this clari@@ fy the new questions regarding the decision of the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his Mit@@ stre@@ ites who ende@@ av@@ eng@@ es to take him during an event@@ ful stage in protection , in the eig@@ able position to explain statements that he could not have meant .
after he had made the appearance at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not int@@ end to confirm President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early mor@@ nings on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ cop@@ ic .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said to whom Mr. Tr@@ ump said to a series of interviews , he meant the innocent .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing of it .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump down , while he tries to turn the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to its campaign .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held words for economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes , and that he found their speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already killed Sar@@ kas@@ mus in his defense .
at the end of July , he moved strong cr@@ iti@@ que as he said , the Russians should Mrs. Clin@@ t Ema@@ ils , but he explained later &quot; Natural . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic bound@@ aries in politics and then turn back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will arrive as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observe the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is cle@@ ver enough to keep his statements enough to keep his statements enough , so that they can be interpreted in different way .
instead of the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted one of the sound , since its re@@ fra@@ ction has declined .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ vocation , he accused his critics often to understand his statements , or to understand his hum@@ or wrong .
but during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze his lo@@ y@@ alen Mit@@ stre@@ ites have brought to him into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of them , as prov@@ ok@@ ant may be his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps broad@@ casts , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus said to the judges of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it &apos;s true in this sense that Obama had an almost unknown , small organization that he called back@@ grounds , completely wrong and therefore it happened , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to ar@@ gue that the government minist@@ ered to Obama , in Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister , it allowed IS@@ IS to spread out the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on every of his words , and against him vo@@ re@@ vs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t know ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats don@@ ates to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , as merely a further evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once more on the price of the market , Café will return to Green@@ point in Green@@ point

but if New York Change is change , it is also new .
a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted Credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new foreign trade , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
it uses the same distributor for the b@@ els bought the same es@@ presso size model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez told that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ns as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ ated onions .
there are natural re@@ iss@@ ants .
the café is no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ oned current of old people .
&quot; many old customers have also been displac@@ ed by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a such customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; was one of the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; was told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A solvent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ n@@ ell@@ ous Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .

when the repor@@ ter was min@@ ced , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bread , liver Cheese , and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bread .
they were made out of a Zut@@ phen and a slightly cheaper that the access to the access .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the great depression was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .

there were the Americans that sent out during the first World War food to hunger European . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; distingu@@ ishes the roads , with which the country went on to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central , donated , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ zation : mysterious foods , such as bread and cass@@ ettes , were used to basic food , the cartridges as a &quot; wonderful way , essence , recovered , because coo@@ ks could hide ir@@ cl@@ an ingredients under a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry conditions .
meat that had been the core of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
so @-@ like mixtures have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ished desire was preferred before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , we prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no more popular at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;

pe@@ an@@ ut butter and b@@ aked onions not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .

he ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a Smoking .
he was a great foreign language .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mist@@ akes if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to equi@@ p his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the heu@@ res of a house@@ keeper associated with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt decided that the White House made the slow food in Washington , but also one of the most frequently prepared food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected , once the country came back on the legs .
the legacy of your continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food .
the pair gave better to understand the essence of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law in law - for example , as they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to mankind in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save the lives of life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a fac@@ ial attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a Civil Protection Group , which has saved some 60,000 people according to the picture @-@ newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of shred@@ ded houses and to make the first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil protective , which shows him with an 11 @-@ hour rescue of a home from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the luminous symbol in the tomb of the war .
as heroes , he has never seen himself , said : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicopter has four façade bombs above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ic gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that not children to play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the image his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s hair usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and s@@ wimm@@ ers with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland finished only with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland &apos;s ground at the bottom of the North Atlantic ocean along with an average of just 1,@@ 220 metres in an hour .
only when it comes on , the five @-@ meter @-@ long beast accelerates on a sat@@ in 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
it seems that of lon@@ el@@ iness of lon@@ el@@ iness , but seems to be a cartridge for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen von der University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science &quot; journal at least by a Greenland , the 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented on Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ pon of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life expectancy that means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
although the ev@@ olu@@ tionary bi@@ ologi@@ an estimated that Greenland has become stone old .
just lack@@ ed the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe . finally , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , immer@@ se it at the surface only in winter .
researchers have been able to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
her time l@@ up@@ emp@@ o , they , when it was placed in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard six animals with a transmitter .
nevertheless , spoil this hair : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swal@@ lowed up the pine trees of a young iron .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the reason of the ice @-@ sea and search for Kad@@ aver , which is from higher water@@ layers to down@@ stairs .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland , or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 cm long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ metres measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens core with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens has already been created before the birth of Ha@@ as , which the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later .
the two smallest Ha@@ as had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear power trials increased greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cm of the third smallest animal , the left @-@ core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear power , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland , normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which arises by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was actually shown for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland an age of 335 years , during the record shar@@ k with 502 of 502 was even 392 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well known .
now researchers able to arrange the length of the length .
as one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably determined at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie was obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in iron waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck had a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ ison point , was captured before Alaska .
due to low temperatures often the organ@@ ism also runs on savings of as@@ par@@ agus .
so they mature later - and al@@ arms slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are often large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a small animal lives on more dangerous animals and should concentrate on them as soon as possible as many descendants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the ev@@ olu@@ tionary sc@@ ulpt@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should invest his resources rather in a long life .

with issues around the building , the Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or has been concentrated in the recent session .
with relief , the Committee adopted by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential area can begin . &quot;
after the plot of land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ osis and fatigue loading , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) has nothing more in the way to interested parties .

Frankfurt benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city of Frankfurt am Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg , the best chances to attract the jobs and companies in London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ x@@ ite vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ rad , Head of Compet@@ ence Network Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is un@@ certain whether it may continue to operate from financial shops in the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ pass , the approval has been given to them in Britain .
this is just large US banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as further important authorities as European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk pro@@ claim ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this was less important for the financial sector less than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the music bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ states &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , in Luxembourg , a large fund sector , trimm@@ ing as equally as Dublin from infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach the large airport thanks to the big airport .
further points are the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ gins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , rent for the first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt got a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer I stand up the city seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European inland market , Frankfurt may move further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W will be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ ite vote .
according to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , about 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal taxes
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax statement for 2015 , which resulted for the presidential election of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons received USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated a income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for their book in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declared last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in relation to financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ agn@@ enh@@ el@@ fer@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind wrong talking and rel@@ ying with regard to its previous promises to publish its tax returns .
it is common to publish its tax conditions for U.S. presidential candidates , although they are not obliged by law because of this .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control a control examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate in the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow to publish something before the control tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , amongst others also the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ usal issues related to assets , his business projects and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high level of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans tr@@ ump to publish its tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid for two years or only very little taxes , and a regional journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax@@ an@@ forests and tax advis@@ ers , the data that could still be the case .
Federal taxes are become subject to a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a control that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buffet , which would make that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ glomer@@ ate here &apos;s headquarters to a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
buff@@ ets said he had been subjected to the IRS as well as a control examination of the IRS , and tr@@ ump &quot; fear &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ t campaign has published its tax statement by the end of 2007 until 2007 .
Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , live , paid on average an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the taxation of the Clin@@ t of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 are related to their income as a salary , unlike the majority of all Americans .
their main money situation was an all @-@ cost index fund , from which the Clin@@ t divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9,000 contributed .

a French director with Jewish roots un@@ sealed a media release after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre@@ fix as there were Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ cured documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last booking , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the country &apos;s country code list .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own Call Center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; clear decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , which behind it , triggered even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were astonished at this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very gra@@ cious .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation of any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correct conclusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident replaced a fairly large reson@@ ance in the internet , where people called for a sc@@ and@@ al .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel announced that it would have been given the attached realm of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you said it in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all the alleg@@ ations of herself and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ appearance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not record the quick release list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , which grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
since the international sanctions imposed against Iran , the interest on pages of Russian companies grew strongly on shops in the country , divided into the ambassador .
the Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , the further trading company is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran had risen in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the economic up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes back for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian Federation issued around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the number of places in Russia .
you could say that the record pay Iranian tourists in Russia from last year has broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the Ambassador is hop@@ ing that it will change .
&quot; I personally personally recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms to home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling tourists
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the defect team @-@ spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to the fame as the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took a role that had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y and made the legend , when he had stor@@ med home to home a victory of favorite New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ ail@@ len .
they repeated the trick after she took place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the back@@ drop of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots , which now has been un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who finished four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and Sk@@ inner made a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord but in the stand@@ alone winning the New Zealand stands in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ denburg was just returned after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of transformation , with the Hin@@ ds in a higher gear to slow it and make it Kenn@@ y and especially sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert from and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they were on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a lubric@@ ating comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have installed a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there were hin@@ ts that he fell down after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no appeal to English Ri@@ val@@ en .
in such a superior victory there was no problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the GB flags like London &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad at so many world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven of 10 titles in Beijing as well as in London .
if you have a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
in the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the field of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparent date for British sport . on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that is equal to Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated to the k@@ nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there was a further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 per destination .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the Council , where the W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
in yesterday , he was disp@@ uted with evidence before the qualification before the qualification was to measure him to measure his height .
in the appropriate competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anc@@ ed Laura Des@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a s@@ ar to med@@ alli@@ on .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute Domin@@ ic in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio has gone down .
in the background , Dr@@ amas was in the background so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical Leit@@ er Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ es and retired from sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if you see the first evening of competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite after that the legendary reputation of GB@@ S that has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland , due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
the future of aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the plant operators will termin@@ ate the energy supply agreement and will increase all delivery contracts , such as the supply of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a maximinum payout for 20 years is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland , are available on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be end@@ anger@@ ed at a closing time .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ ic effects , since the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry melting , which led the last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melting of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closing time .
this step follows the lon@@ ging spec@@ ulations in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which uses the large aluminium melting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , divided that three further owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority of a joint venture between AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant operates in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting , &quot; divided the company with .
AG@@ L told that the Tre@@ aties of the so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that contracts will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on demand for AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong performance markets for large retail prices .
AG@@ L divided the value of contracts already in its annual financial statements of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts to operate the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... the melt to operate or the power supply to the melting . &quot; not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that in 2010 it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in November this year , even if there is a declaration , why it came back from the contract .
analysis of analysis due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting of Portland , Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen told about 900 megawatts and Tom@@ ago at electricity every year .
if both plants should disappear from the market , that mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets would not be good , &quot; he said .

the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an family ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem of show@@ cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn ) as well as the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party .
this represents almost every birthday of a children &apos;s dispatch ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this Public@@ ity .

the director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without a repe@@ aling of the federal government would only be worse yet .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Municipal centers are chron@@ ically supp@@ ressed , meaning that thousands of people of the most important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave the violent relationships , people with im@@ aging and pres@@ sur@@ ing debts , families who have been dismissed by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have problems rights and this collection indicates that they will not need help .
the Federal Government will cut up by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to justi@@ fy their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we request the gener@@ ational ministers and the Federal Minister of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to raise these measures immediately , so the people who need help with legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in contemporary horn : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and larger , it was not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight Meg@@ abytes , which would be sufficient for about two sel@@ f@@ ists with high resolution .
the iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 to the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices over the internet , but they come from the Stone Age .
however , 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Computer Fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West @-@ bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , even though qu@@ eu@@ pon slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , an digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop as a laptop .
then there were a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphones in Germany was € 392 in 2015 .
no one could have happened in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be at the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the wise phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile map of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today are providers that all many years later came to Nokia .
always and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple there are only 555 million units alone .
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running shops of the pay@@ less app providers and t@@ elecommunications company will come .
around the smartphone is now a whole industry in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac World &apos;s introduction to the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , easy to use with touch screen .
Apple began the winner of Apple , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the follow @-@ up .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
they now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is 20 years after the invention of an invention .
on average , each Germans now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone also once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for personnel responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent relief applies now as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England has to expand the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only available in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , the biggest attraction is He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we used a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached again by creating new possibilities for or@@ ts@@ ans@@ und companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we are already able to create 40,000 new jobs , creating 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games to be found on the world stage .
the bi@@ fl@@ er had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answered each question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for a infrastructure project .
extension is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in all GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billions of infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport bus terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequency @-@ test drives of the world .
now they are ready to supply a third running , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row along with our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that can be proud of England .

Ad@@ Block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse &quot; regarding display block
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to handle ad recorder , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad lock on its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post where users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the encoding regarding his advertis@@ ements , in order to identify the display of displays that part of the site is to be found .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this species H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the respon@@ sive Open Source Community and the change@@ over since the invention of display lock is , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media is left out in the struggle , is a strong indi@@ z that have become a concern for the industry .
according to a study published by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe is about 200 million people of sco@@ ot@@ ers , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who can access their mobile devices over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung is 84 percent of advertising companies .
the company has to block ad recorder to desktop PCs , because mobile ad recor@@ ders have no effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided a speaker with .
advertisement on Desktop PC makes a sufficient large proportion of income , so Facebook appears to be worth a stri@@ de worth of such as a worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just had become a new filter , because they would also block content on the side , which are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user there is no positive experience , so we are planning to communicate the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of Facebook in an e @-@ mail address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad recor@@ ders are a silent resources , why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to lay more control into the hands of the people .
woman at assumed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at an assumed self @-@ committed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman placed in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in an act of desp@@ air on the road and were met by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that there was a Swiss Swiss age in the age of 49 , including several vehicles , including a truck , to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some are still not identified , the police said to report these as well as any witnesses of the incident .
it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosec@@ utor needs to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ es on the highway - it was decided that the drivers don &apos;t need to go out in the middle of the night as it was named in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acquitted of the cas@@ ual murder , having killed a man and killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had been drunk , and has become conscious of the streets .
the Court found that the polic@@ eman had answered on a call @-@ call -- to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road had a &quot; perfectly extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhabitants .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on tools and algorith@@ ms that resem@@ ble climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once could have been reported conditions .
scientists have previously reported that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere , could yet slowly continue to pass .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ elled the slow rotation of the Venus its day side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a rain@@ forest to drop the surface of most of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution which had been suspected of plan@@ etary research .
although it was likely to be hab@@ itable , the Venus was a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ oration and their steam steam was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
when you with@@ drew hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know them today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ells in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research .
Patrick Roy returns as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a lower co @-@ determination of the team &apos;s decision .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new coach immediately after a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years , I have met my duties as Head trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and destination . &quot;
I stayed in the course of summer long and much more thought as I could improve this team to give it more depth , this is needed and it &apos;s a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a specific legislation on decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been fighting Roy on May 23 , 2013 , had been committed to him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only .
Roy was awarded the winner of the winner in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the subsequent season in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ gee workers take discussions on , strike strike
the workers are exposed to re@@ mun@@ eration for northern oil workers , while all other parties shall set aside for a new inter@@ round round on the table , the negoti@@ ator is negoti@@ ated .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were performed spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt unions can confirm that we have agreed to start the process of the current route , &quot; it means a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full day sessions in the next weeks , which will start the beginning next year to re@@ sign the problems .
the unions said that their last strike that the first in over 25 years is a protest against possible wage sub@@ missions of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating reduction follows a 10 percent decline for online contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the necessary space to come across the market up@@ swing .
Shell has announced plans for his part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries because its business activities as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ count@@ ant support with the British energy companies BG Group rati@@ onal@@ ised .
energy companies are based on lower raw oil prices under pressure , an economic situation in which the British Union had to leave the European Union due to the decision of the British in June .
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest emplo@@ yers which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared to average about $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the newest Mission with the Kepler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers helped to collect the complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Star Wars .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating on different rates as well as in which connection the rotary @-@ time rooms with the planet stands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now the adult &apos;s adult .
you are now on the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , this stri@@ ped stars will hit great amounts of stars .
because this winch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rot@@ ational rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by increasing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star fle@@ cks -- as s@@ ungl@@ asses -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that massive stars slower than less massive stars .
re@@ bel compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ bles are smaller than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that long red rot@@ ors have to do massive rot@@ ors , better against faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Stern@@ enh@@ ouse of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constellation has a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still much more before us to learn more about how , W@@ ann and why stars their rot@@ ational rates slow@@ ing down and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their newest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal soon .
entering a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball star
the tears run by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ Star in the best days of Base Base .
after his emotional re@@ viewing announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will carry a last time the Tri@@ h@@ kot of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to be called &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; , stated the 14 times All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es World Series .
since 2007 , his signature has been signed from a tenth year contract with a total of 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he served as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as players paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two further bas@@ eball players in the main statistics similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old can still not be recorded in the quiet Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al his appearance is outside the square .
in 2009 , the super@@ star was launched at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be a major inf@@ ant , for years long over an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the sper@@ re was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez told it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his f@@ arewell day failed not dis@@ ap@@ pointing .
during many bas@@ eball alloys in their last games , Rodri@@ guez was often to sit on the bank .

Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a wi@@ per athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race events , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases became known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish ge@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positi@@ vely in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the athlet@@ ic athlet@@ ics competitions this news for un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated that it is used as a ask@@ an agent for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ missions .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the courts over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing @-@ hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands for Ch@@ en full cooperation with research , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we are working together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of sports@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio le@@ aded the message over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is supposed to act on the banned substance around the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was given provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also be positive already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow inv@@ aded themselves with criticism at the Ath@@ en@@ ians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men go not the right beat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are standing under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , about all the weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically un@@ loaded nation cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested positi@@ vely on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both contest the intake , however , are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further serious blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had the entire Russian crew until an exception due to systematic D@@ op@@ ings , the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous poor messages in Rio .
in addition , the earlier publ@@ ishers in China had also ensured even between athletes .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ acker her rans@@ om
programmer from Er@@ press@@ ant malware , currently targeted businesses - and are successful successfully .
according to a current survey of the malware contrac@@ tor specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once , partly with several victims of a attack with press@@ er software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the aim of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware detection .
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly offered by the perpet@@ rators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are specialized in their press@@ ors software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes and attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
are they successful there , it falls significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe a rapid evolution of the malware software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most pain@@ ters were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the express software for itself .
only private users were the goal , but the change went to company att@@ aches in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , she is searching for un@@ recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files are encrypted using the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
then the software presents the requirements of the press@@ er .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code to get the files , the victims must have money - usually in form of a crash nutrition Bit@@ coin .
but where private use is the personal photo database on the game , it goes back to firms for sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls if a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported net loss due to R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent , even the business activity had to be completely supp@@ ressed , in case of people living in Fat@@ al .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay not , you promotes only the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that are paid , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to resolve from stand@@ still in operation the demand of perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security for@@ scher of F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the user areas and contact the contact with the press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as it can be paid by Bit@@ coin , freely available support websites one or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will be redeemed individuals according to payments of a few hundred euros , businesses must pay part hard negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ turn@@ key .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware relief , the h@@ acker are always professional and share the work , explained security professionals Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
it is likely that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their harmful software then in the form of a software tree to the actual nar@@ rower .
the previous malware kits were created by malware self , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ table tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the press@@ ors are then searching for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you log@@ ged in one of the for@@ ums in the underground , buying the set of a crime and commissioned a further way to install the software on as many PCs .
payment takes place per content calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ erg@@ ometers apply sp@@ ammer with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies to secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey confidence on that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scans .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators have already been doing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not contain any sufficient threat , the perpet@@ rators , with the publication of sensitive data , such as customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case of damage , depending on the type of data , even more multiple than before .
also , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new targets on the Internet of Things to take place .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety for@@ scher , as they could get a thermo@@ stat under your control .
in the middle of winter , the Fre@@ isch@@ strasse could be worth a rans@@ om for such a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators are then able to block a whole production line in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday applications
in the small HR V I want to pack everything : a little SUV , a little Coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , shows itself as extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and there is no spot in any place .
the materials of the inner space are well @-@ processed and can be pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls below .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V for the storage room .
it is not only a boot space of 453 l at high @-@ speed and 10@@ 26 l when folded back @-@ folded back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical , as it sounds : the seat areas of the back bench can be folded as Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer a storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to judge any more silent .
the everyday consumption is 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine load : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be direct .
the equipment can be made in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
the city @-@ emergency braking system belongs to the security systems ( works up to 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ warning system and the trace assistant .
sometimes , the coll@@ isions are ir@@ cul@@ ated , because he evaluated many obstacles in the rank@@ ings as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ating objects . &quot;
very reliable , the remote control system works .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t when needed the speed .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touchscreen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more .
two USB@@ - and one HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a little bit of permanent .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive € 20,000 , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
Honda offers a versatile and everyday car with the HR @-@ V .
Airline is not liable : fall on flight bridge
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the flight bridge .
because a liability is only possible for d@@ angers which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken up a kne@@ el kne@@ el .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
illness : when paid the organizer
after their journey , we got money back after their journey to find money when the cause of the disease is free of charge in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case a family was difficult to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting on the second day of their Tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ ian Mountains .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ations on a def@@ ective cl@@ oning , supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ utes the sea@@ water .
the family was the view to have been a man@@ age@@ ous and accused against the organizers .
before court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the cl@@ ergy is indeed def@@ ective .
but the organis@@ er knew just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the samples of water no contamination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ an@@ gled by using one - is one of the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 seats .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the refugees of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had wor@@ ried about others .
the state had to destroy and decided at the same time at the same time .
safe : our country will not answer the violence of perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
this triumph we will not g@@ ged the terror@@ ists .
when tigh@@ tened the country would have to leave the country , but the safety and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of security forces , and &quot; in medium four @-@ digit size regulations over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism must again be penalty under penalty .
video surveillance is to be improved , which will be so nov@@ iti@@ zed that the purchase of weapons is worth on the Internet .
the most recently discussed silence for doctors should remain under de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the medical certificate , he wants to search for solutions that could be reduced by the haz@@ ard of citizens , he said with a look about the psych@@ ic collection of psych@@ ologists .
in order to prevent any radi@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister also holds a better social support .
teachers have to be prepared better for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of criminal investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister is evident against shareholders against shareholders .
&quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe out of the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality .
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness hold it for constitutional problems .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I rest the bur@@ sts of the bur@@ ka .

better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it is regularly on the stra@@ pping road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the law h@@ eg@@ esp@@ ur should be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in St@@ au when they drive over the Highway ( A 43 ) .
the road building extended road construction on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 . August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Port Wes@@ eler street on the road lane around 700 meters .
drive them directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : traffic divi@@ des an early stage , making it improved the total amount of the Federal road 51 on the most versatile section of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the lane at the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ es nerv@@ es the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the retreat goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler street .
from here , traffic will only be guided over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ build a good three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to record primarily the heavy duty traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the con@@ sens@@ ory st@@ au is forbidden , the competent authorities cannot say .
however , with years we expect : for the bridge has an official start @-@ use of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal h@@ eg@@ esp@@ ur , the state is aware of the traffic noise in the school holidays because with disabilities be reck@@ on .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday , on Wednesday at the construction site .

rain instead of stars : hope in weather conditions
the weather has made the star Wars Gu@@ ck@@ les in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a St@@ rich by the bill - but there are still hope .
the night was because of clouds and rain was bad@@ ly suitable to observe the heavenly spect@@ acle , the Chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will surely see many stars in the sky .
with the star@@ vation , it is about Persian that includes 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star cat@@ ches .
they have their names , because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes to the Nor@@ theast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening they drive for ever@@ more , at night it is time for hours , at the morning it is already far from the wake of so@@ unding .
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , one of these problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , there is about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent emp@@ tied their sleep often or permanently .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many different causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society of Sle@@ ff@@ or@@ etion and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you under@@ stands , but is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and le@@ ep disorder .
straight to sleep , many people can find many people as harm@@ less or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht says the board member of the German domestic medical association with practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind that , organic , psych@@ ic or ins@@ ulin @-@ related factors , but also provides medication .
not rare is the sleep expression of another condition .
&quot; very early watch is frequent , especially at a depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors are required .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be po@@ or@@ ly lie , awake every two to three hours and begins to gre@@ en@@ ware , about all day problems and ensure that We@@ e@@ ß gives an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore .
when should you sleep with sleeping disorders ?
who is not good for a period of one month at least three nights per week , and the day should be imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is ab@@ ro@@ uted , tired , un@@ sli@@ pped , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily del@@ ight@@ ful , has voting fluctu@@ ations or physical pain such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to prevent the sleeping disorder , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , behavi@@ oral behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablets only in case of exceptional and no more for two weeks - in@@ quiries .
located in Germany , there are hardly any interest in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo fibro@@ ma , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why one should first turn to the house physician at bed@@ time , we@@ t We@@ e@@ ß .
it can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should happen to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in the sleeping laboratory in medical laboratory , for example , if swal@@ lowed with respiratory haz@@ ards , in case of disease or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a le@@ ep disorder isn &apos;t explained .
it is necessary to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a lunch menu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ xed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after being shortened , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes a Nas@@ en@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a F@@ üh@@ ler on the finger is wearing .
in addition , a camera also shows the sleeping corner .
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are fairly many pitches on which one can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watching television to sleep , alcohol abst@@ ain from and at night not at the clock - then we begin to calculate and that &apos;s all and not eligible to be eligible .
what the jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed himself a dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V teams at the Olympic Team .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put on Facebook protective via Facebook to be placed in the cr@@ iti@@ que of the cr@@ iti@@ que .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ eger receives 20,000 € premium and a jung@@ le ch@@ ast@@ y 150.000 € should not have none of lack of medals , &quot; wrote 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ checks are very good .
so that we cannot compete with countries that are very much to promote and on the topic D@@ oping not just see or it even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls shall be adjusted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler should have reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly what it should also hold with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de von Lug@@ di@@ ps arrested
professional Di@@ iev@@ es at the Airport Düsseldorf
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed as a ban@@ de several pocket and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 pm civil servants recognised as a ban@@ de in the area of Düsseldorf Airport , which was known to the police officers from the past .
since the middle of July this year , two women and two men had committed to have been committed to the year since mid @-@ July .
the specialists in the crime of crimin@@ als 34 may have the di@@ vor@@ s that went to Germany from criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts .
they took over 15,000 Euro in total .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den@@ ks , in between still a remainder of a stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work on the first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
you walk along the east to west , you come to playing places , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a be@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a grey house anyone has ug@@ ly &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl which will soon be torn down , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the competent estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is called , in the last weeks , it is preferred with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents are occupied , but on the ground floor there are still rooms , and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , since the beginning of the year , the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 was lab@@ eled as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were cleared on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , according to their official statements , according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors to the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the renovated building worker was commissioned by the premises in the unknown house owner .
on 13 July a Berlin administration Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers moved to the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the brushes in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about vor@@ ce .
there are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the immediate vicinity of the skin .
left hand is not the main or@@ ge of many occasions : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the p@@ ines since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are mainly from the police presence .
with the residents of skin projects , they share the care before increasing rent and genetic engineering .
it sounds not after a pine , which would be able to allow multi @-@ axis protection against v@@ and@@ al@@ arms .
the grave , den of Berlin &apos;s inner g@@ ator and the police , does not exist in their neighbours , obviously not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional labour market , which also today has a lower average in comparison to the rest of the city , and high risk of poverty .
also house occupied and the most born residential projects are already long to become p@@ ines : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main street , near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the ma@@ zer had been cleared under the great police , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in the past few years , the district has become increasingly for the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : with them , residents from GDR @-@ times and former Haus@@ er occupied its p@@ ines .
this is also noticeable in the rentals , which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they det@@ ects them on the pan@@ es or fresh @-@ kn@@ itted faç@@ ades , which were subjected to paint spra@@ ying .
no other road was mentioned in this year so often together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that , not all neigh@@ bors who can see it as a problem , could not be affected by the crime , according to statistics , statistics are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make state @-@ damage , the ten@@ ds to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house in addition to the controversi@@ al 94 years , there cannot be any talk of un@@ certainty .
what manner of violence is important : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars also give it directly in the Rig@@ s no longer .
for the studied archit@@ ect@@ in , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately moved to the Riga street - and stayed .
therefore , it was so important that the residents had returned their road : from the police , politics and media , which appeared in July all over the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer will continue the road to them : by soci@@ able newly built new buildings in former construction g@@ aps , which are the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good enough , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can &apos;t be absolutely gu@@ ilt . &quot;
but what should I do if you never hear someone ?
there is also fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even at the police and the residents .
in particular , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
who walks , should be aware of his - exactly like someone who draws in a quarter @-@ quarter , there may be bad over noise .
all only with previous names are asked to be asked to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is a new refugee camp
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le is the contact partnership in terms of integration and organis@@ ational .
in addition , she is a social worker in front of the site .
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working with refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else can be carried away .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer indicates that the amb@@ ition is more than than@@ k@@ ful , that Deu@@ ver@@ le now is that Deu@@ ver@@ le is now a problem which has a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ aw@@ less than rather , on the multitude of en@@ ligh@@ tening areas - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the area of social work , a ei@@ v@@ able Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not their central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in particular , we go to organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for six weeks .
it has a 50 percent site for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the highest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Ehr@@ en- and German officials supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and minor problems , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be available at the Was@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection pl@@ ough@@ s , which have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection to the connection .
you need to accommodate refugees in own or rented residential rooms .
the costs for construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must wear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility is changes from Land@@ rat@@ ers , municipality and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time is very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to find the administration of no private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work yet to have been included in private apartments so Deu@@ ver@@ le .
therefore , the apartments have to be not@@ orious , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the washing machine .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are trainees , training places , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who have to be m@@ illed or furnished .
&quot; more places are well , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help household , do non @-@ profit labour - and motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
she hopes that the work for the community is to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and the customer .
human beings have to develop an as@@ rig@@ ation experience .
so do it require offers like sports , contacts with loc@@ als and above all language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so you also ski@@ p here administration and honour .
it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes and it can make sense of sense , for example with language courses .
those who want to feel the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be un@@ profitable , who never have to integrate .
the distinct majority be motiv@@ ated .
but there is also reason to be hon@@ est , &quot; people who doesn &apos;t work at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and the customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others to motiv@@ ate others .
all that is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two inci@@ dents fear radic@@ alization in front of radic@@ alization , also in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what lack of n@@ ai@@ v is really good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could not be able and would not close them out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet the hel@@ pers are already .
these inci@@ dents may be subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks of the attacks were completely re@@ signed .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would glad@@ ly stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , main and hon@@ ors have to look back on site and in the region after activities .
in the background they are always in the background , that soon a new stores of refugees and migrants are coming to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually it is un@@ fair , to set hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived where we would like , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer is also obvious that the ur@@ b@@ acher can also be used to integrate the previous people in sen@@ sible .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , they have to help them are both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
